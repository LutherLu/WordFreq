THE MSC GROUP,

 CEO STATEMENT
We are publishing our 2019 Sustainability Report while facing one of the major challenges of the century. What we thought would be a health threat has suddenly turned into a global health crisis with unpredictable global socio-economic impacts, hitting countries, econo- mies and people around the world disproportionately in the short and long term.
This unprecedented event accelerated the understand- ing that globalisation creates not only new opportunities for wealth and trade, but also adverse and unexpected impacts requiring transformative approaches and resil- ience at the same time. From now on, more flexible and faster responses and, above all, determination will be instrumental in developing new pathways. Working together is and will be more fundamental than ever, and sharing know-how and visions will certainly lead to a new generation of multi-stakeholder partnerships. Businesses, regulators and the investor community are already addressing some of those adverse impacts by jointly supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy, promoting stricter and more transparent due diligence processes as well as by generating or lever- aging capital markets driven by impact investing and blended finance models based on ESG criteria.
There is no doubt that in order to create “the future we want”, we need to build a more equitable and sustainable process for development, including financial processes, where no one is left behind. Yet, to achieve this and allow growing tangible contributions to the realisation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we need to further enhance cooperation at all levels to secure the stability and long-term resilience of economies. This is of paramount importance as it is needed to ensure that all stakeholders are better prepared to overcome unexpected disruptions in value and supply chains, without compromising our ongoing collective global efforts towards fostering inclusive sustainable development.
The world needs changes, and we all need to play an active part in redefining the present while building the future. MSC’s commitment to fully support this journey is well embedded in our DNA: as a family company, we feel an integral part of the global community. Helping to make this transition happen, through our unique approach to shipping and our fast decision-making process, is very important to us, and we consider it to be part of acting responsibly.
In this new era, we have clearly understood the true value of the word “indispensable” and have reassessed the importance of those activities that have been taken for granted so much that they became invisible. With the world suddenly paralysed, guaranteeing the trans- port of goods became fundamental and, in this scenario, the shipping industry has been praised for its central role in guaranteeing interconnection at global level. We commend the recognition in this respect received by the international community, including specialised United Nations Agencies such as the ILO and the IMO, in valuing our sector and especially seafarers as essential.
To better illustrate how we successfully translate our commitment into concrete actions, we have included in this report a dedicated section on the global crisis. The latter highlights our support in addressing global trade disruptions and helping to secure economies on the long-term while promoting responsible business practices, in line with our broader sustainability strategy and our four Sustainability Pillars.
During the outbreak and beyond, we played a key role in guaranteeing global logistics supply chain continuity. To do so, we continuously worked closely together with port authorities and relevant stakeholders to mitigate impacts on trade disruptions. Thanks to our global reach, flexible approach and support of governments, we were able to connect our customers with their final receivers, securing a direct consignment. And above all, we never stopped.

4 CEO STATEMENT
MSC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 5
Reviewing our contingency plans, adapting capacity and, whenever necessary, redefining our routes to offer better solutions to our customers and business partners, as well as absorbing the shift from air and intra-European cargo, were all part of this momentum. In parallel and, as a direct consequence, we contrib- uted to reducing emissions on a global level, as liner shipping is still less impactful than other modes of trans- port. Despite this particular situation, we kept focusing on innovating responsibly. The significant fleet growth achieved in 2019 with new-generation ships enabled us to further increase our environmental efficiency, thus pursuing the ambitious challenge of decarbonisation.
Going the extra mile has always been part of the way we do business and we take the same approach to providing help. The initiative of converting passenger ferry vessels from Grandi Navi Veloci, part of the MSC Group, into floating hospitals to assist patients with COVID-19 and those convalescing, in cooperation with relevant stake- holders and Italian authorities, is a clear example.
Yet, all of these efforts have been possible thanks to the people who worked tirelessly to make this happen. All my gratitude, once more, goes to our staff ashore and
on board for their excellent work and for the extraor- dinary commitment demonstrated in such challenging times. Our top priorities will therefore continue to be strengthening human capital management, ensur- ing safe crew changes and the safe repatriation of our seafarers, as well as further enhancing robust health and safety protection protocols and measures across our ships, infrastructure and offices.
I would like to conclude by saying that being and remain- ing a successful and responsible business enterprise in these difficult times does not come without risks and challenges. However, it is the way we react to those risks and challenges that defines us and becomes our strength in the long term. Learning from this experience, remaining committed to excellence and leveraging our ongoing efforts to bring further sustainable value to our customers, communities and countries in our day-to day-operations and wherever we operate will be our very first step.

 GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS – COVID-19

  KEEPING THE WORLD MOVING RESPONSIBLY DURING THE GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS
While we were writing this report, the new coronavirus (COVID-19) was suddenly changing our world and the way we were living and working. In just a few months, the pandemic affected all human beings, societies and economies. The global health crisis reshaped produc- tion and trade patterns, forcing to re-think global value chains while enhancing concerted efforts at the national and international level to minimise social impacts on workers and communities. Yet, above all, it helped
us to realise that we live in a truly globalised world, which relies on complex integrated systems with strong mutual dependencies across multiples countries. As a result, as never before in the last century, we observed that, although responses and mitigation measures were adapted to local specificities and settings, different cultures or different levels of development, current and future global challenges require and will require shared responsibilities and global solutions.
SHIPPING AS A STRATEGIC ACTOR IN THE CRISIS SCENARIO
DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES
This unprecedented event clearly showed the strategic role of the shipping industry in supporting the global economy. In fact, in the early phase, aviation had to dramatically reduce operations because of the closure of many airports worldwide. The transfer of goods was therefore mainly managed by sea.
In this scenario, granting continuity was vital to secure connections at international and intercontinental level and, at the same time, to directly support businesses as well as the distribution of medicines and medical equip- ment in the critical areas across the world, thus helping to mitigate the spread of the pandemic and to ensure medical treatment for those affected by COVID-19.
As one of the key actors in global supply chains, MSC reacted promptly, showing flexibility, resilience and financial strength, despite the difficult operating conditions. We remained fully committed to ensuring business continuity by maintaining essential services across all markets, thus contributing to the high-priority transport of essential goods such as foods, critical agricultural products, raw materials, medical equip- ment and other vital supplies. Connecting our customers with their final receivers also has a strategic implica- tion related to the mitigation of the pandemic, due to the possible contamination of the goods during the transfer. Securing a direct consignment and reducing the risk of contamination while providing a door-to-door service are considered instrumental in this particular situation.
Additionally, we adjusted our capacity and, when neces- sary, reviewed our routes, to absorb the shift from air and intra-European cargo to maritime seaborne trade. As a consequence, this switch generated a significant impact on CO2 emission reduction in the transport sector. This adds to our existing initiatives, measures and strategies we are implementing to meet and/or exceed international environmental regulations.
Thanks to the support of governments, our work never stopped. This enabled us to play a crucial role in supporting the world’s population to enjoy basic needs by keeping trade flowing through our global network at global, regional, national and sub- national levels.
At the same time, MSC enhanced and continued to implement procedures to prevent health risks to its employees around the world and its crew on board ships. As soon as reports of the outbreak emerged, we immediately implemented robust health protection measures across our ships, infrastructure and offices, in line with the official guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) and in compliance with national authorities’ recommendations. We made sure to keep these measures in place as long as necessary to help counter the threat of the disease and protect our people and their families.

  SUSTAINING AND SECURING ECONOMIES IN THE LONG TERM
In our efforts to support our customers in minimising disruption to their businesses and in securing the supply chain, we immediately adapted our shipping services networks to help companies ship goods more easily.
In Europe, in particular, we assisted shippers to use our short sea shipping networks as a reliable alternative to road transport to avoid new land-border blockages created by governments’ essential action to curb the movement of people and to be prepared to meet current and future market demands. Building on our extensive direct Mediterranean and Baltic feeder network and in response to market and customer needs, shippers of dry and reefer cargo could rely on MSC’s European and Short Sea services to help ensure the continuous and quicker flow of their goods across Europe.
Transportation of food, including perishable food, as well as pharmaceutical products and essential goods in Europe, was also ensured by Grandi Navi Veloci (GNV), part of the MSC Group.
As a leading player in supporting the development of the European strategic short-sea and regional connec- tivity networks knows as “Motorways of the Sea”, GNV never stopped focusing on supply chain continuity. To illustrate, during the crisis, GNV continued to ensure key services in the Mediterranean region, by connect- ing the islands to the main inlands and contributing to reduce social costs and traffic congestion: during the period March-May 2020, about 40,000 trucks used maritime services instead of road transport. Examples include services between northern and southern Italy
and from Italy to Spain, Tunisia, Albania and Morocco. Once again, during the outbreak, GNV confirmed its key role in Mediterranean seaborne connections, proving that maritime transport is an “essential infrastruc- ture asset”, especially for the major and small island connections. As soon as restrictions eased, GNV also continued to actively promote the growth and revival of the Italian tourism industry through the transportation of passengers (EUROPAX) connecting Italy and its two main islands, namely Sicily and Sardinia.
Furthermore, MSC has continuously worked closely with port authorities and relevant stakeholders to mitigate economic impacts on customers and disruptions to the global community. This was achieved through the constant monitoring of maritime network restrictions and joint efforts focused on adapting our complex supply chain system accordingly. Preserving our usual close contact and relationships with our customers was also essential for us during those challenging times, as a company that has always differentiated itself in the market through our personal touch. In addition to actively upgrading our online booking platform, myMSC, we worked tirelessly to continuously adapt contingency plans and advise our customers on how to manage changes, relying on our efficient internal information-sharing system that collects data from 155 countries.
During the first half of 2020, we also promoted innova- tive and cost-effective solutions to our customers and business partners. For example, we launched the Suspension of Transit (SOT) Container Shipping Programme using some of the world’s leading trans- shipment hubs around the world (Bremerhaven in Germany, Busan in South Korea, King Abdullah Port
in Saudi Arabia, Lomé in Togo, Rodman PSA Panama International Terminal in Panama, and Tekirdag Asyaport in Turkey) as advance yard storage to help shippers begin moving goods early in anticipation of a resump- tion in demand. This provided flexibility and enhanced operational and financial efficiency, as it empowered our customers through the control of their storage costs at the booking stage, while allowing them to adapt the delivery date to their own needs.
It also helped to decrease congestion in ports of discharge and improve efficiency, as products were placed closer to distribution networks.
At the beginning of the pandemic, a sudden slowdown in trade resulted in a necessary reduction in capacity from container shipping networks in order to match lower demand for cargo shipments. However, as the impact of the crisis lessened during the start of the third quarter of 2020, we kept innovating with new shipping and logistics services, including storage facilities, while adapting solutions from the past. For example, we reintroduced a service which had been discontinued in the past but now perfectly suited a partial recovery in cargo volumes on a particular route. The subsequent rebounds in trade flows after the easing of lockdowns on businesses and communities have underscored the strategic importance of our flexible and reliable network management, as well as our strong competencies in delivering ad hoc services.
More information on how we bring long-term sustainable value and keep enhancing hinterland networks and regional connectivity can be found in the “Social Inclusion” chapter (pages 34-55).

 PROTECTING SEAFARERS
The world’s seafarers were among the categories of workers hardest hit by the pandemic, with many working long stints at sea due to the closure of borders and other restrictions on the movement of people. During the crisis, a number of statements, calls of action and communications were released by the broader inter- national community urging governments to address the challenges faced by the shipping industry and the world’s seafarers.
In June 2020, on the occasion of the International Day of the Seafarer, the UN Secretary-General acknowledged the essential role played by the world’s seafarers during the global pandemic, “whose dedication and profes- sionalism keep the vast majority of world trade moving safely, delivering vital goods – including food, fuel and medical supplies.” He also stressed that “this year, more than ever, all countries in the world must honour our seafarers by recognising them as key workers and providing the necessary travel assistance to ensure safe crew changeovers and repatriations.”
At the same time, the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) addressed governments to emphasise that “safe ship operations and crew wellbeing should not be compromised. The humanitarian crisis seafarers face has implications for all of us, for the world economy and for the safety of life at sea and the environment.“
To help manage the industry problems of crew stuck at sea, MSC extended contracts for container shipping
crew and provided social and financial support in relevant cases, while urging governments to respond to the call of the UN Secretary-General – and many others in intergovernmental and industry bodies – to facilitate crew changes in support of seafarers and their families.
In July 2020, a number of governments with leading global shipping hubs agreed to help seafarers still stranded at sea to return home by easing port and border restrictions and enhancing commercial flights. While welcoming these improvements, we continued to stand side by side with other shipowners and seafar- er groups to encourage individual governments to act.
Meanwhile, on the land side, a similar label of impor- tance and expression of gratitude should be aimed at workers in port terminals, depots and warehouses, as well as drivers of container-carrying trucks, trains and barges, who valiantly continued working during the crisis, where government rules permitted them to do so. We believe that the strategic role these workers played, and the value they generated by enabling business continuity, deserve further recognition at a global level.
More information about contingency plans related to preven- tion of illness, including during pandemics, can be found in the chapter “Occupational Health and Safety” (page 89). For more information on how MSC protects the human rights of seafarers, please refer to the chapter “Business Ethics and Protection of Human Rights” (pages 111-113)

GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS – COVID-19
GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS – COVID-19

  ENSURING REPATRIATION OF GUESTS AND CREW MEMBERS
In March 2020, following the official announcement by the World Health Organization declaring the COVID-19 as a global pandemic, countries around the world started to close borders and to implement restrictions on inter- national and non-essential travel with a view to limiting the spread of the virus. These measures significantly impacted the travel and tourism sectors, including the cruise sector, requiring prompt and increasing efforts from all operators to address not only unexpected financial consequences but also unprecedented human capital risks and health and safety issues affecting passengers and crew members.
MSC Cruises’ operations effectively halted by the end of March 2020. Yet, the company kept working tirelessly for months to guarantee safe working conditions on board, while arranging the repatriation of guests and crews from our cruise ships through charter flights or via other solutions, in collaboration with national authorities. To illustrate, a robust health protocol of periodical medical checks, temperature measurements, preven- tive isolation and quarantine, as well as the sanitation of spaces and goods has been implemented on board all of
our ships to ensure the health of our crew. A shore-side team of experts has been set up to provide psycholog- ical support to the crew to cope with stress, anxiety or other disorders that may have arisen during the pandemic. In parallel, a dedicated team was tasked to continuously monitor flight availability and work closely with authorities and relevant stakeholders in identify- ing the appropriate ports for disembarkation, including, whenever possible, ports in close proximity with health facilities and hospitals with sufficient capacity to accom- modate patients in case of need.
ASSISTING OUR EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE TO ADAPT TO UNEXPECTED WORKING CONDITIONS
Implementing our existing business continuity plans ensured that operations and customer service could continue, while our people avoided travel and practised confinement or social distancing. Within China, for example, we could keep business going by shifting certain functions to other offices in the country and by relying on the support of our shared services centres in other regions, as part of a plan determined before COVID-19.
The company’s leadership was swift to implement a global ban on business travel and to cancel visits to our Headquarters from colleagues, customers and suppliers from the end of January 2020. This advice came just days after local management in China, the country where the first cases of COVID-19 were reported, raised the alarm to halt incoming visits from colleagues. International meetings shifted to video-conference format until further notice, following instructions from Headquarters. Remote working began in our offices in China in January, and subsequently at our Headquarters in Geneva and in many locations around the world. MSC provided IT equip- ment to enable employees to work remotely. Specific e-learning tools were also available to ensure MSC people could use technology to work remotely in an agile way. Shifting to remote working is part of our established business continuity processes, focused on the advance- ment of skills and knowledge in respect of both online conferencing and the efficient use of online workspaces. As soon as the situation improved, employees were requested to rotate their time in the office to ensure social distancing. For those coming to the offices, MSC provided protective equipment, including masks and gloves, and circulated strict safety rules to respect at all times.
The leadership, in collaboration with the Human Resources Department based at the Headquarters, regularly evaluated and analysed conditions to ensure that it was sufficiently safe for employees to return to the office.
Employees were provided with regular updates, commu- nications and advice on how to respect safety and preventive measures. Additionally, relevant departments developed specific online tools to support employees around the world in protecting their mental health, enhancing resilience to stress and being able to cope with the difficult living conditions.
During these challenging times, MSC also regularly emphasised the importance of complying with its Code of Business Conduct and reporting any misconduct or viola- tion, either by means of the MSC Speak Up Line or through any of the reporting channels indicated in the section of the Code “Reporting Misconduct.” At the time of writing, most of these policies and procedures are still in place.
Additional information on how we promote responsible business conduct and our human rights due diligence processes can be found in the chapter “Business Ethics and Protection of Human Rights” (pages 106-123).

                     CONTRIBUTING TO COUNTRIES’ AND COMMUNITIES’ RELIEF EFFORTS
Expressing solidarity towards populations and countries affected by natural disaster, conflicts and other calami- ties remains a fundamental moral engagement for MSC. Additionally, all entities of the MSC Group have already been involved in similar humanitarian and emergency efforts in the past, in collaboration with relevant local and/or international stakeholders. In this respect, despite the challenging operating and market conditions, we actively contributed to COVID-19 emergency and relief initiatives, supporting a number of countries and communities in their fight against the global pandemic.
GNV FLOATING HOSPITALS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AREA
Grandi Navi Veloci converted the ferry ship GNV Splendid into a floating hospital to aid patients with COVID-19 and those convalescing. GNV started working on the project together with classification society RINA1 in early March,
in close coordination with Italy’s Liguria Health System and Civil Protection. This solution was implemented in a very short period, thus increasing Liguria’s hospital capacity and, where necessary, serving other areas of the country. GRAPHIC 2
This initiative catalysed joint efforts and actions from numerous partners, who provided products and services free of charge, in order to equip the ship with all neces- sary supplies, including HP-Aruba, Alpha Trading, Artigo Rubber Flooring, San Giorgio del Porto, Auscomar, ItalBrokers, Le Navi Maritime Agency, Burger King, Covim, Emis, Giunti Editore, IdealService, Infomaster, Mantero Sistemi, Provveditoria Marittima Ligure Angelo Novelli and Ansaldo Naval Technical Studio.
More recently, in August 2020, GNV joined forces with other MSC Group entities to provide the Italian government with two additional fully equipped ferries, GNV Azzurra and GNV Aurelia, to be used as floating hospitals in the south of Italy. Both ferries were made available to assist COVID-19 paucisymptomatic patients
for the entire course of the disease or to host guests needing to quarantine during the confinement period. A specific sanitary protocol has been implemented on board, strictly based on specific guidelines and instruc- tions provided by the Italian Ministry of Health and the Italian Red Cross. Among other specific measures, an important upgrade of the onboard air-conditioning system was carried out by the GNV Technical Department under the supervision of the classification society RINA. The Italian Ministry of the Interior acted as coordinator of the emergency operation, by ensuring the effective imple- mentation and monitoring of proper security measures at local level through its local offices responsible for the territory (“Prefectures”) and its national police forces.
1 RINA is a founding member of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), formed in 1968. The purpose of a Classification Society («CS») is to provide classification, statutory certification and services as a Recognised Organisation acting on behalf of a flag Administration, and assistance to the maritime industry and regulatory bodies as regards maritime safety and pollution prevention, based on the accumulation of maritime knowledge and technology.

Stationed at Ponte Colombo in Genoa’s Ferry Terminal,
the solution offered a total capacity of 400 beds. The floating hospital also featured a heliport and areas dedicated to healthcare personnel and crew, organised to guarantee suitable standards, comfort and flexibility.
GRAPHIC 2
RINA verified that the new floating hospital complied with current regulations, identifying the correct balance between safety protection, naval regulations, the medical needs of a hospital indicated by the regional healthcare authority (ASL), and the urgent need to find a means of helping authorities and the National Health Service to address the fight against COVID-19.

LOOKING AHEAD
Despite the challenges we may face, MSC’s fast and flexible decision-making process will remain guided by our core values which place employees, customers and our passion for the sea at the heart of our devel- opment strategy and business continuity planning. In future, we can only imagine doubling down on adapting to evolving trade scenarios, market needs and broad- er transformation in global value and supply chains.
Digitalisation has been slow to come to container shipping. Only recently have significant changes started to take place around documentation, finance and booking processes, the incorporation of e-business tools and the online connectivity of equipment. Nevertheless, we must also acknowledge the importance of technol- ogy and digitalisation during COVID-19, which have dramatically supported the shift to new ways of working and, we believe, also modified workers’ expectations and habits in this respect.
In line with our socially inclusive approach, our investment in innovation, technologies and digital connectivity will promote the safety and the expertise of our employees, not their replacement. We will there- fore continue to promote e-learning opportunities, while continuing to invest in enhancing physical connectivity between countries through our integrated network of road, rail and sea transport resources, which stretches across the globe.
Furthermore, MSC is currently focusing on improving existing emergency preparedness and response conti- nuity/contingency plans, as well as health and safety operating protocols onboard our cruise and cargo ships. These are based on scenario analysis and designed in accordance with relevant international, national and/or regional guidelines.
We are and will remain fully committed to further enhancing existing management systems to minimise risks related to human capital management, as well as passenger and crew safety, both during the outbreak and in post-pandemic operations.

 26 INTEGRATION OF SUSTAINABILITY INTO THE BUSINESS MSC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 27
INTEGRATION OF SUSTAINABILITY INTO THE BUSINESS

 GOVERNANCE: DECISION-MAKING AND COMMITMENT
MSC Headquarters, Geneva, Switzerland
MSC’s sustainability governance structure is designed to support the progressive integration of ongoing and emerging strategic economic, social and environmental topics across the organisation. Our broader approach to sustainability focuses on the promotion of responsible business conduct in accordance with MSC Values, our Code of Business Conduct and applicable good corporate governance requirements in the countries of operation. Additionally, management measures, processes and priorities are set and formulated in line with international standards, regulations and principles. These include but are not limited to:
• A wide range of sector-specific international standards and requirements defined by maritime and labour conventions adopted at the international level by the United Nations
• Relevant standards developed by the International Standardisation Organization (ISO) and recognised Classification Societies
• Broader internationally recognised sustainability best practice, standards and principles, as well as voluntary commitments and pledges such as operating responsibly in alignment with the United Nations Global Compact’s Ten Principles
Overall responsibility for sustainability rests with the Group Executive Sustainability Steering Committee, comprised of the Company Leadership and senior executives from various departments at the Geneva Headquarters. This Committee oversees the formulation and planning of sustainability objectives in alignment with MSC’s business strategy and priorities, by provid- ing policy guidance to key business units, functions and departments implementing related standards, policies
and processes. It also ensures that measures and activ- ities reflect relevant external stakeholders’ expectations and comply with the complex regulatory framework in which MSC operates.
REPORTING LINES
The Sustainability Steering Committee is advised regularly by Department Heads and subject matter experts from across the Company. Multiple corporate departments provide insights and counsel to senior management in the form of briefings, presentations and direct correspondence. Furthermore, due to the complex nature of our legislative and operational framework, MSC relies on the expertise of various teams based at its Headquarters to support sustainability initiatives and assist relevant departments in implementing sustain- ability matters throughout the Company’s value and supply chains, as well as in embedding these within the business model. Activities include, for example, briefings, ad hoc training, improvement of policies, processes and procedures, and interactions with exter- nal stakeholders from both the private and public sector. Our approach is regularly evaluated and improved based on internal assessments and developments at the national and/or international level. Cross-departmental working groups are regularly formed as needed, to provide diverse expertise to management on cross- cutting themes.
MSC’s sustainability subject matter experts also actively participate in international or sector-specific fora to advance good corporate practices by sharing best practices or expertise. Progress is regularly reported in our Sustainability Reports and in related external communications published on our official website.

METHODOLOGY AND MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT CHOOSING OUR MATERIAL TOPICS
This report clarifies how MSC’s decision-making process and day-to-day-operations bring inclusive social progress and contribute to economic growth on a global scale, while promoting respect for responsible business practices and the protection of the environ- ment. Our materiality approach remains driven by our four Sustainability Pillars, which have been identified through a global assessment taking into account our complex regulatory frameworks, our sector specificities and the MSC Group Values.
This approach enables us to have a broad framework of reference, which can be adapted to a number of internal and external factors which are impacting the international shipping sector and global value and supply chains. This is essential to us, as we consider our materiality assessment a continuous process, allow- ing us to strategically redefine it against megatrends, evolving trade patterns and customers’ needs, as well as ongoing and future global and geopolitical challenges.
In addition, we focus on reporting areas which are relevant to our wide range of key stakeholders and on the progress we make in terms of social impacts, environ- mental performance and governance efforts, both as an individual company and as part of collective actions. Regarding governance, given the complex nature of our regulatory frameworks, it is paramount that we stress how we ensure compliance with laws, including compliance with international standards, relevant maritime conven- tions adopted at the international level by the United Nations as well as our progress in implementing stand- ards and recommendations defined and/or formulated by third parties such as recognised Classification Societies. This illustrates our commitment to invest in and conduct our business activities responsibly. Moreover, some “Case Studies” have a focus on specific programmes and initia- tives which show how we cooperate/we work jointly with local communities, business partners and other stakehold- ers with a view to keeping and maintaining a constructive dialogue thus to contributing to enhance a social positive impact at local operational level.
In line with the above, each chapter of our 2019 report contains relevant information and explanations related to the shipping sector’s regulatory frameworks, considerations related to compliance requirements and comprehensive lists of international conventions and regulations for each key area. Concrete examples included in this document demonstrate how we opera- tionalise and implement relevant recommendations and international and/or sector-specific guidelines developed by a number of stakeholders, including the international community. This approach is fully integrated into our risk assessments and project finance processes.
While this report covers the 2019 fiscal period, we
decided to extend the reporting scope to provide
information on how we responded to the 2020 global
health crisis, which, regretfully, while we are finalising
this report, is still impacting economies and societies
at a global level. In this respect, we have added an
introductory section which describes our significant
contribution to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development despite the difficult operating condi-
tions and the evolving scenario we are experiencing.
In particular, we have highlighted how our decision-
making process remains guided by our core values, the
ESG factors and the United Nations Global Compact’s
Ten Principles, when addressing challenges and
major global disruptions. To better demonstrate our
systemic approach to sustainable development, we have
linked our main actions and steps to each of our four
Sustainability Pillars and related chapters. We have also
illustrated the leading role we play in supporting econo-
mies in the long term, without compromising our strong
commitment to environmental stewardship and to act
responsibly, in accordance with internationally recog-
nised human rights and labour standards. Furthermore,
we have stressed our continuous engagement with

 OUR IMPACT: CORE STRATEGIC AREAS AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE SDGs
• People-centred approach whilst supporting the development of international trade, which contrib- utes to long-term inclusive social and economic growth
• Promoting cleaner seas, land and cargo through massive investments in low-carbon technology, energy efficiency and operational efficiency; continuous investments in responsible innovation and latest available technologies
• Whether on land or at sea, the health and safety of our people is our top priority
• Conducting business in a fair, ethical and responsible manner, promoting the respect of internation- ally recognised human rights and labour standards, including steps to identify, mitigate and prevent
the risks of modern slavery in operations and supply chain
ASSESSING AND IDENTIFYING IMPACTS ON THE SDGs
Being part of the international shipping sector, MSC contributes and impacts all Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Indeed, as we could observe during the 2020 global pandemic, transportation is one of the key sectors to secure and meet the basic needs of the world’s population. In our globalised and interconnected socie- ties, physical connectivity remains the prerequisite for inclusive growth and development.
In this respect, we design our risk assessment processes by giving a broader definition of the nature of the impacts we may have on societies, communities and countries. In particular, in line with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (MNE Guidelines) we not only manage and mitigate risks internal to our business, we also consider risks external to our business and the potential adverse impacts that may derive from our activities. We focus on how our investments and operations create value and positive impacts on popula- tions and our planet with a long-term perspective. This includes considerations related to our contribution to addressing global issues and challenges, such as pover- ty and climate change.
Our approach is embedded in the different activities of each of our entities, taking into account their respec- tive sector’s specificities and the local contexts in
which they operate. Impacts may differ, however, our decision-making process and our systemic and dynamic assessment methodology remain the same. This report therefore explains how the different investments and initiatives undertaken by the MSC Cargo Division around the world take into account Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors, with a view to maximising opportunities for generations to come and minimising forces that are affecting inequality as well as disruptions in global economies.
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
In measuring potential impacts, being a global company with interests all around the world and given the nature of our business, we are in constant interaction with our key stakeholders, both from the public and private sectors.

According to the European Community Shipowners Associations (ESCA), “in a globalised world, the seamless and sustainable transport of goods and passengers is a key enabler for growth and prosperity. 90% of everything we consume travels to us by sea. Without any doubt, shipping is at the very centre of our globalised world.”2 Over the past 50 years, MSC has been shipping products, everyday goods and essential supplies across all conti- nents, becoming an industry leader in the international
shipping sector. MSC is at the heart of global trade, contributing to the growth of many different sectors, developing and linking global supply chains in a respon- sible way.
Additionally, MSC strives to continuously adapt to changes and challenges in global trade patterns by devel- oping tailor-made end-to-end transport solutions to help customers and business partners to reach new markets and opportunities all around the world.

“Maritime stakeholders are seeking more efficient and sustainable operations in the face of changing power dynamics and stricter environmental regulations. The short sea and feeder shipping sector is playing a
3 valuable part in this evolution.”
Short sea shipping refers to the movement of cargo by sea over relatively short distances as opposed to intercontinental cross-ocean deep sea shipping. MSC’s combination of deep-sea services and short sea services, connected to its landside intermodal operations, enable reliable door-to-door deliveries for dry and reefer cargo. This also allows us to help maximise the flow of regional supply value by offering integrated systems that strate- gically link transport solutions by sea, road, railway and
inland waterways on a global scale. Our aim is to further enhance strategic opportunities for both local actors and international business partners, driving economic and social growth in the long term.
In line with the above, MSC continues to expand not only its freight transportation services but also its transshipment operations, as well as its logistics and terminal networks. Challenges in creating and improv- ing physical infrastructure around the world remain. However, we continue to fill this gap through massive investments in container terminals and related facilities, such as warehouses and depots, while expanding our short sea services and feeder networks with extremely short transit times.

 CASE STUDY
FEEDER SERVICES AND INTERMODAL SOLUTIONS IN ASIA
MSC continues investing heavily in developing or enhanc- ing existing regional and international trade corridors, including through feeder operations in strategic locations around the globe. Among container vessel sizes, feeders are the smallest segment with under 3,000 TEU of capacity. Feeders bring shipping containers to and from smaller or regional ports via international or transshipment hubs, serving bigger ships travelling on long-haul lanes.
As an illustration, in April 2019 MSC joined the Intra-Asia trade, launching a number of dedicated feeder services, ensuring reliable services and competitive transit times between North East Asia and South East Asia. These services aim to further enable and support the growth of other trades by developing and enhancing cargo flow, while providing alternative solutions benefitting local shippers and producers, significatively impacting on local economies.
Figures reported by Alphaliner in December 2019 showed that the total capacity deployed in the Intra-Asia trade is
INTRA-ASIA FEEDER SERVICES
In the coming years, MSC is expected to further grow its network coverage in the region by introducing additional services, connecting regional terminals with major hubs in Asia.
Additionally, MSC has been expanding its competitive and sustainable inland transport solutions by increas- ing its intermodal transport routes through its subsidiary MEDLOG. In particular, during 2018 and 2019, MEDLOG China increased multimodal transportation services for inland manufacturers providing connections to Central West Europe and West Asia, benefitting from the decision of the local government to enhance critical structural infrastructure. Additionally, MEDLOG China has been working with local MSC Offices to jointly develop landside services in order to extend the company’s capabilities to provide door-to-door services. Alternative ad hoc logistics solutions were also implemented through the use of RoRo and special equipment size types, in collaboration with both local and offshore MSC and MEDLOG counterparts. This helped to decrease the expected congestion during Chinese New Year and enabled us to meet the demand for more efficient and reliable services.

equal to nearly three million TEUs, representing the largest capacity employed in a regional trade. Yet, such capacity is utilised for the Intra regional cargo and to assist bigger ships, with their long-haul/international cargo.

     SUPPORTING THE SHIFT FROM TRUCKS TO ALTERNATIVE OF INTERMODAL SOLUTIONS
FOSTERING WATERWAY OPERATIONS WITH BARGES
CASE STUDY

MSC, through its subsidiary MEDLOG, supports the
shift from trucks to alternative modes of transport by
investing in the most efficient and sustainable inter-
modal solutions, wherever possible. In particular, we
are enhancing our inland depot network in strategic
areas to be able to use inland waterways such as rivers
and canals, which allow us to significantly reduce the
goods. Barge owners and/or operators comply with
the highest safety standards, requirements and inter-
MEDLOG has been offering integrated intermodal solutions to a wide range of stakeholders and business partners in Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany and France since 1998. Our operations benefit from the increased inland waterways network developed by the European Commission in key regions and from the empty container network owned by Medrepair, MEDLOG’s subsidiary.
In recent years, MEDLOG began promoting alternative intermodal services, improving reliability while enhanc- ing financial efficiency for its key stakeholders. In 1998 only a minority of our carriers’ haulage containers were
moved intermodally, compared to by truck. Today, MEDLOG cooperates with a wide range of suppliers offering more than 150 weekly barge sailings which are used to transport containerised freight via rivers and waterways. In 2019, approximately 120,000 containers were transported using barges instead of trucks via the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam.
Transporting containers using barges as the main trans- port mode allows for a significant reduction in absolute CO2 emissions. As a transport mode, trucks are more than three times more polluting than barges, as shown in the graphic below.

According to the European Commission, “the potential for increasing the modal share of inland waterway trans- port is significant. Compared to other modes of transport which are often confronted with congestion and capacity problems, inland waterway transport is characterised by its reliability, energy efficiency and major capacity for increased exploitation.”4
In line with the above, through our investments in barges, we are promoting energy efficiency, support- ing the reduction of congested corridors, and minimising negative externalities for populations. Additionally, barges allow us to further increase the safety level of operations especially when transporting dangerous

                      The average distance of our carrier haulage is roughly 250km (round trip) and the average weight is 18 tons. Whilst truck transport is mainly on a round trip basis, intermodal transport by barge is based on one-way transport with only the first or last mile performed by truck; the empty container is picked up at or returned to one of our inland depots. When the main carriage is by barge, the truck part of the transport is reduced, allowing a reduction of total “road kilometres”of 45km to 100km. Furthermore, whenever possible, MEDLOG also actively promotes rail transport, offering a complete service with low emissions.
In January 2020, MEDLOG moved the first cargo in northern France via the new, enlarged barge service to Bruay sur Escaut in the Hauts de France region, which covers a large area along the French-Belgian border. This first and last mile service benefits from the recent regional infrastructure investment made by the Flemish government in Doornik, a city in the Belgian/French border area, which allows barges of up to 2,000 tons to be operated.

up to 70 metres in length and with 50 TEUs capacity,
significantly reducing the congestion around Lagos port.
Additionally, this new solution optimises land opera-
tions and reduces transit times up to one week, allowing
importers and exporters to have a reliable and cost-ef-
fective solution, and cost-effective service.
To meet the local market demand, MEDLOG Nigeria also offers intermodal services to connect our recently constructed depot with inland locations and remote areas. Our depot and trucks exceed local environmental compliance requirements, in order to reduce noise and air pollution and ensure safer working conditions for our drivers. To be hired, our drivers must have relevant certifications and strictly follow our policies.

MEDWAY is currently supporting local capacity-building in the rail sector in collaboration with several stakeholders by offering tailor-made vocational training with its highly specialised trainers. Based on a comprehensive analy- sis of the labour market and related business outlooks, MEDWAY is also supporting national and regional devel- opment plans focused on reducing unemployment rates by promoting job creation in the railway industry.
As an illustration, since 2019, MEDWAY has been collab- orating with the Scuola Nazionale Trasporti e Logistica11 located in La Spezia, Italy, by offering vocational train- ing for young people interested in pursuing a career as a train driver or rail operator. The school is the first training structure in Italy dealing only with logistics and trans- port. The vocational training programme is funded by the European Social Fund (ESF) Operational Programme (OP)
for the Liguria Region, Italy, and focuses on “employabil- ity, equal opportunities and helping young people make the transition from education into high-quality jobs”12. In this respect, MEDWAY has developed ad hoc train- ing modules to ensure that young people acquire the necessary expertise, technical competence and deep knowledge of innovative processes, procedures and equipment to become highly skilled professionals and enter the Italian railway’s labour market. Additionally, as part of the agreement with the Liguria region, MEDWAY does not require any fees for these training opportuni- ties and is committed to recruiting 70% of students upon completion of the courses. In 2019, 20 students completed the training. Additional courses will be launched for new apprentices in 2020.
 IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS (2020-2024 PERIOD), MEDWAY PLANS TO INVEST:

  CASE STUDY
IMPLEMENTING “I RAIL ACTION” TO SUPPORT INTEROPERABILITY IN KEY EU RAIL FREIGHT CORRIDORS
In recent years, the European Commission has enhanced its efforts to remove barriers that prevent the expansion of European rail logistics chains by promoting inter- operability13 across Europe. The main objective of the interoperability strategy is to standardise the several sub-systems of the European railway network, at all levels, creating an enabling environment for operators and other relevant stakeholders that will allow trains to cross countries and contribute to the creation of a European Rail Network that is much more competitive and less fragmented. To achieve this, the European Commission is harmonising requirements, procedures and technical standards. Additionally, several member states have further increased their investments in struc- tural infrastructure, for example by building new lines for passenger and freight trains and refurbishing exist- ing infrastructure to allow an increase in train’ length, weight and gauge in tunnels.
In line with the above approach, MEDWAY Iberia is currently implementing the project I RAIL Action, co-funded by the European Commission, which aims to implement European-wide procedures and interfaces between rail actors, in order to contribute to an interop- erable and cost-efficient information exchange system within EU member states. The I RAIL project will support railway undertakings, infrastructure managers and wagon keepers, helping to ensure interoperability and data safety in five of the eleven EU Rail Freight Corridors: Mediterranean, Atlantic, Rhine-Alpine, Scandinavian- Mediterranean and Baltic-Adriatic.
MEDWAY is active in the Atlantic and Mediterranean corridors. We expect the project to have significant long-term impacts on several EU member states, as the actions will allow interoperability between any of the five corridors and the exchange of information will follow standard specifications.
The main expected project outcomes focus on the following specific objectives:
• Increasing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized railway undertakings, which must meet the requirements in terms of complexity of TAF TSI functionalities
• Improving the speed and quality of communication between rail stakeholders by replacing manual work and paperless processes through
the implementation of TAF TSI standards and
the digitisation of safety procedures
• Reducing operational costs by an average of 10% per year by implementing TAF TSI
standards and the digitalisation of
the Safety Management System
• Enhancing the efficiency of processes by planning
in advance and decreasing idle time in operations by an average of 10-15%, resulting in improved service quality and cost-effectiveness.

 CASE STUDY
EXPANDING INTERMODAL AND SHIPPING SERVICES VIA THE PORT OF TRIESTE, ITALY
DIRECT CONNECTIONS FROM TRIESTE PORT
According to Oxford Economics,14 the European shipping industry directly contributed EUR 54 billion to the EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employ- ing 685,000 people. However, the same report reveals that if the spill-over effects on other sectors of the EU economy are taken into account, the total contribu- tion of the European shipping industry rises to EUR 149 billion, providing employment opportunities for 2 million people.
Since its creation, MSC has being a key player in Europe, extensively supporting job creation and dramatically contributing to the development of connections between regional corridors and the rest of the world. Today we continue to focus on this strategic area, through massive investments in infrastructure, terminals and sustainable integrated shipping and logistics solutions.
For example, to complement our outstanding global port coverage, with over 200 sea-freight services world- wide, MSC developed a European intermodal network connecting Trieste Marine Terminal, in the north of Italy, to a number of inland destinations. The planning of the rail connections was coordinated with MSC’s Far East Phoenix ocean-liner service to ensure efficient and competitive transit times for shippers. As of today, MSC provides direct calls from the Trieste Marine Terminal to the eastern Mediterranean area, Greece, Turkey, the Red Sea and Asia. Optimised connections from the Terminal to the rest of the world are ensured via Gioia Tauro Transshipment Terminal, located in the south of Italy.
Thanks to its advantageous geographical position, Trieste Terminal can serve multiple inland destinations in faster and more efficient ways compared to the stand- ard route through which North and Eastern Europe are served. Indeed, a container shipped from Asia or Turkey to a German inland destination needs up to six extra navigation days to reach the main discharging port, where it continues its journey via rail. This not only improves the efficiency of the transportation itself, but also allows for the reduction of CO2 emissions and there- by enhances the sustainability of the transportation. MSC collaborates with leading European retailers to provide tailor-made transport solutions. Through close coordination with customers, MSC focuses on individual shippers’ needs and unique requirements, helping our business partners and customers to optimise their respective supply chains.

SOCIAL INITIATIVES
Trieste Marine Terminal (TMT) is one of the most active logistics companies in the region, significantly contrib- uting to the regional and national economy. In recent years, the Terminal carried out a number of actions to further strengthen the relationship between the citizens and the port community, in collaboration with major local stakeholders such as the yearly “Port Open Day”. Furthermore, TMT is also a sponsor of various initia- tives targeting the younger generations living in the region, including local sport clubs such as the main Trieste football and basketball teams.
TRAINING AND APPRENTISHIP PROGRAMMES FOR YOUNG STUDENTS
Direct investments in school courses and the local Maritime Academy are further examples of how Trieste Marine Terminal actively participates in the social and economic life of the community. As an illustration, TMT supports selected transport and logistics learning programmes in schools. In particular, training and apprenticeship programmes have been launched in collaboration with the local Nautical Institute and the Maritime Academy. TMT managers regularly provide ad hoc courses on agreed key subject matters and accompany students during their visits to the container terminal.
As part of its broad, holistic approach to sustainable development, MSC promotes innovative financial oppor- tunities to facilitate access to finance for exporters or importers, through its subsidiary MEDLOG.
The Collateral Management (CM) Programme, launched in 2019, is a tripartite contract between MEDLOG, financing entities (bank, funds, seller) and borrowers in which goods are under custody of the collater- al manager (MEDLOG) as a “third party holder”. MEDLOG implemented this programme in collabo- ration with international institutional partners, local banks and Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs). The Collateral Management and its warehouse receipts are also used by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, under its Global Warehouse Finance Program (GWFP)17. According to the IFC, “about 75% of the world’s poor are rural and involved in farming and agriculture. The GWFP program is part of IFC’s efforts to increase access to finance for farmers and to promote agriculture development as a means of alleviating poverty.”
The programme aims to overcome barriers related to the lack of accessible credit that borrowers may face. It gives producers and traders the opportunity to grow their business, or start activities for newly established companies. It also supports local trade opportunities, preserves jobs and helps “increase market efficiency so that commodity producers will have more options to time the sale of the products and have better cash flow management”. The programme provides local banks with liquidity (short term loans) or risk coverage (credit guarantee) backed by warehouse receipts. Exporters have access to financing by keeping farmers’ goods
in a warehouse under Collateral Management. They have more flexibility regarding the timing of their sales and reimbursements. They pay back the loan once their goods are sold.
The CM programme fits perfectly into the value chain offered by MEDLOG SA and the MSC Group.
So far, the CM programme has been implemented in East Africa, benefitting coffee producers and rice importers in West Africa. Cocoa and cashew in West Africa are also in discussion to support producers. Brazil will be the next step.
ENABLING SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAINS
MSC also supports business partners, local produc- ers and exporters by continuing to invest in cold chains and the latest available cooling technologies. Our reefer solutions allow fresh commodities to reach different trade areas, securing food supply regardless of the season and preventing food waste in the event of low market demand. Additionally, MSC’s Controlled Atmosphere (CA) containers help perishable goods to travel further and for longer, potentially opening up new markets for exporters and importers.
By increasing the supply and affordability of quality food around the world, reliable cold chains can help reduce poverty, foster responsible consumption and promote the right to health.
Additional information on our investments in reefers and cold chain technologies can be found in the “Environment” chapter (page 80).

THE OCEAN IS OUR HOME
For MSC, the ocean is our home. We are part of a thriv- ing ocean economy upon which we, and many millions of people all over the world, depend. Climate change poses short, medium and long-term risks to populations on every continent. Communities already in disadvan- taged situations and vulnerable people are, and will continue to be, disproportionally affected by climate change effects, according to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)18. Addressing this global challenge with a clear understanding of inter- connected social impacts is at the top of the international agenda and requires a multi-perspective approach. Since 1990, global annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have risen by 41%19. To play our part in tackling this,
DECARBONISATION TRANSITION
MSC’s environmental focus is on vessel and operation- al efficiency, and emissions reduction. We are working hard to make a positive contribution to the associat- ed SDGs, notably SDG 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 14 (Life Below Water), while also providing a service that brings value to socie- ty. As a family-owned company, with a long-established seafaring heritage, MSC makes commitments knowing that they must succeed and endure. The trust of valued clients, partners and employees depends on this assur- ance. We see our focus on sustainable operations as a primary way to contribute to lasting business partner- ships and future generations.
In terms of the CO2 impact of shipping, it has been estimated that the sector is responsible for 2.2% of total global anthropogenic emissions. However, shipping already compares favourably to other transport modes with respect to fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions (grams per tonne-kilometre)23.
Shipping is a vital facilitator of world trade: 90% of everything we consume travels by sea. Cargo transported by the liner shipping industry represents about two-thirds of the value of total global seaborne trade20. There has been a 73% increase in world GDP in the last two decades; in parallel, seaborne trade has increased by more than 112% over the same period21. As shown in the graphic below, a consistent increase in world seaborne trade
APHIC 11
is expected over the next decade. In this scenario the decarbonisation transition poses a significant challenge for
the whole industry, with direct impacts on the environment as well as on the global economy.

              In addition, some shipping companies, including MSC, have already significantly improved their efficiency, as indicated by a reduction in the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (see page 63). MSC believes that decarbonisation of shipping is necessary. We support the ambitious emissions reduction targets that have been set by the International Maritime Organization24(IMO) and are already investing heavily in available solutions and working hard with key partners to develop scalable and innovative solutions to reach these targets. We also acknowledge that decarbonisation depends on technology breakthroughs in propulsion technology and zero emission fuels. We are are contributing to
meet the IMO’s goal. It could even help accelerate the development of commercially viable zero-carbon ships by the early 2030s.
In parallel with the aforementioned collective initiatives, MSC is investigating emissions reduction solutions related to biofuel blends (see pages 66-67) and inter- modal solutions (as described in the chapter on Social Inclusion, see pages 34-55). We are evaluating applica- ble innovative solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells, complementary battery power, other alternative fuels and, possibly, wind and solar, to help accelerate research and development initiatives that will help meet our emissions reduction ambitions.

READINESS FOR IMO 2020
On 1st January 2020, the Amendment to the IMO International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annex VI regulation regarding IMO’s sulphur limits (IMO 2020) came into effect. It aims to tackle the cardiovascular, respiratory and other diseas- es linked to poor air quality. For ships operating beyond designated Emission Control Areas (ECAs), it limits sulphur in fuel oil used to 0.5% (mass by mass), compared to a previous limit of 3.5%. This amendment will lead to an estimated 77% drop in overall sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions from the shipping sector, or an annual reduc- tion of approximately 8.5 million metric tonnes of SOx28.
FUEL SUPPLY CHAIN ESTABLISHMENT
To meet the sulphur emissions limit, many MSC ships switched to low sulphur fuel oil. MSC achieved timely and systematic preparation for IMO 2020 thanks to its status as a world leader in maritime transport as well
as its strong, well-established partnerships with major global fuel providers. These partnerships allowed the necessary flexibility during the transition period, ensur- ing compliance in all global regions and at all the ports in which MSC operates.
The coming into force of IMO 2020 is possibly the most significant disruption in shipping since commer- cial containerisation became widespread in the 1960s. Impacts extend beyond ship owners and operators too, as markets, manufacturers, retailers, consumers and maritime technology specialists are also affected by aspects of the transition to low-sulphur emissions opera- tions. It is the most significant regulatory change for the shipping industry as a whole to ever be implemented. Throughout 2019, MSC was assiduous in its implemen- tation of the final preparations for compliance with this regulation, with efforts focused on: (i) supply chain estab- lishment for low sulphur fuels, (ii) ensuring IMO 2020 implementation onboard, and, (iii) Exhaust Gas Cleaning System (EGCS) installation.

ENSURING IMO 2020 COMPLIANCE ONBOARD
to recirculate the EGCS wash water within the system, without discharging to the sea. MSC signed commercial contracts ordering a large number of scrubbers to be installed across the fleet. By the end of 2019, MSC was an industry leader on EGCS installation, with a greater number of systems installed, or being installed, than its counterparts29.
With the new legislation now in place, and regulators working to ensure equitable enforcement of IMO 2020 globally, the focus in the sector is now on achieving other IMO objectives to reduce the shipping sector’s environmental footprint. MSC is prioritising CO2 emissions reduction, in line with the IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships.
MONITORING ENERGY EFFICIENCY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
MSC fully supports reporting CO2 emissions transparent- ly and precisely in the European Union (EU) Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system, as mandated by EU legislation, and the IMO Data Collection System (DCS) on fuel consumption. MSC also continues to use the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) to record and analyse individual ship and fleet perfor- mance over time. The indicator is set out in the IMO
FLEET CARBON EMISSIONS - ANNUAL EEOI
Guideline MEPC.1/circ.684 and reflects ship perfor- mance in terms of transport work. EEOI can also be used to provide information on the benefits of mainte- nance measures such as hull or propeller cleaning, as well as operational enhancements. MSC began tracking EEOI in 2015 and then recorded a 13% improvement up to 2018. MSC has been awarded the Energy Efficiency Operational Index Certificate by a globally recognised third-party auditing company. In 2019 the EEOI was slightly above the value for the previous year, which may be explained by the disruption associated with the dry-docking of many MSC ships for the installation of EGCSs to ensure compliance with IMO 2020. Smaller vessels were deployed temporarily, to replace larger ones in dry dock, and there were some blank sailings, both of which contribute to an elevated EEOI.
MSC expects a reduction of EEOI in 2020 thanks to the arrival into service of the 10 new 23K+ TEU Gülsün class vessels in late 2019. Compared to 2003, when the average capacity per ship was 2,500 TEU, by the end of 2019, the average capacity was close to 6,800 TEU. This, together with MSC’s focus on maintaining one of the most modern fleets on the high seas, are key ways in which MSC ensures optimal fleet efficiency. Consistent with our energy efficiency programme, and to set a further ambition for emissions reduction, we have agreed to an EEOI-linked target of 14.22 by 2023, down from 14.8 in 2019.
For a fleet as large as MSC’s, throughout 2019, the preparation of vessels and crew for IMO 2020 required significant planning, investment and training, as well as communication and documentation of fuel handling and changeo- ver management. MSC Shipmanagement developed and issued detailed internal guidance on the aspects listed below, with regular training for crew ashore and on board, in a classroom context and/or by webinars, to ensure proper implementation.

In addition to a switch from HFO to VLSFO, the strategy used by MSC to ensure compliance with the progressively tighter IMO sulphur regulations has been investment in Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS). Despite being more expensive, MSC chose to invest in hybrid EGCS because of their greater reliability and operational flexibility, safety for the crew and, importantly, to future-proof the retrofitted vessels. Hybrid EGCS can operate in both open and closed loop, meaning that it is possible, if necessary,

BIOFOULING: AN OPERATIONAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHALLENGE
In the context of shipping, biofouling refers to the accumulation of aquatic plants, animals and microorgan- isms on vessel surfaces that are either immersed in water or exposed to the surrounding marine environment. Biofouling can reduce a ship’s efficiency. Encrustation causes increased hull frictional resistance, so more power is required to maintain service speeds. It is estimated that biofouling can cause an increase of up to 40% in fuel consumption, with consequent increases in costs as well as emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and air pollut- ants. Furthermore, biofouling on ships can contribute to the transfer of alien (invasive) species. This poses a serious ecological threat because of the link between invasive species and biodiversity loss and the extinction
of native species of flora and fauna. This in turn has impli- cations for the essential services derived from nature, such as medicines, food and clean water. Use of certain anti-fouling systems may pose further threats to marine life.
ACTING TO CONTROL BIOFOULING
MSC follows the IMO ‘Guidelines for the control and management of ships’ biofouling to minimise the transfer of invasive aquatic species’30 (‘Biofouling Guidelines’), which provide an approach to the global shipping community to follow when addressing this issue. All vessels managed by MSC carry an onboard Biofouling Management Plan, which provides practical guidance to crew on minimising the transfer of invasive aquatic species and keeping the ship’s underwater surfaces and internal sea water cooling system free
from biofouling. The Plan takes into account the vessel’s trading area, expected environmental conditions and operational requirements related to the prevention of biofouling (e.g. average sea water temperature, fouling severity, speed, dry-docking interval) for, in particular, the propeller, rudder, bow thrusters and sea chests.
EXPLORING ALL OPTIONS
There is no single solution to emissions reduction from shipping; a variety of approaches is required. MSC there- fore embraces a 360-degree approach to improving efficiency, deploying a variety of solutions focused on significantly improving environmental performance. Propeller boss cap fins (PBCF), installed on the hub cap of the propeller, reduce the hub vortex generated by propeller, and the associated decreased load on the shafting helps to improve propeller efficiency. MSC carried out detailed technical studies and tests to confirm the reported benefits of PBCFs for vessels under its management. Following initial positive trial results regarding the effect of PBCFs, in 2012 MSC embarked
on a programme to retrofit the propellers of the entire fleet with optimised, lighter designs featuring PBCFs to achieve fuel efficiency gains, as well as benefits for noise reduction, as outlined on page 81. Recent monitor- ing and analyses performed by MSC Shipmanagement have confirmed that vessels equipped with PBCFs regis- ter savings of 3% in fuel consumption, which translates into significant gains for emissions reduction.
MSC celebrated another environmental milestone, arising from the decision to use an award-winning non-toxic foul release coating in its managed vessels. This coating makes it harder for fouling organisms to cling to surfaces, even at slow steaming. The biocide- free layer leads to reduced drag, and thus improved fuel efficiency and lower overall emissions. The coating has now been applied to 29 other vessels, resulting in a CO2 reduction of around 4,000-23,000 tonnes over a five-year cycle in each case, depending on the size of the vessel, amounting to approximately 315,500 tonnes of CO2 over the five-year period.

BIOFUELS AS A PATHWAY FOR EMISSIONS REDUCTION IN SHIPPING
In line with MSC’s commitment to climate action and, specifically, our support for the IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships, we are working on the testing and implementation of various solutions. This ensures that progress will continue to be made, while technological solutions are developed for deployment at scale. In addition to the focus on energy efficiency, MSC is exploring other pathways to reduce its environmental impacts throughout its supply chain.
WHY BIOFUELS?
Use of biodiesel instead of conventional fuels offers environmental benefits for two primary reasons. Plants used to produce biodiesel absorb CO2. This gives biodiesel a lower overall CO2 emissions profile than regular diesel. Responsibly sourced biofuels could provide one solution to help the shipping sector to meet the 2030 IMO level of ambition for CO2 emissions inten- sity reduction and could also make significant progress toward the 2050 levels of ambition.
Biofuels can also offer benefits for air quality and therefore human health, because SOx emissions from biodiesel, for example, are almost absent and particu- late matter emissions are also very low.
TRIALS UNDERTAKEN
Despite these benefits, there has not been widespread use of biofuels by the shipping sector owing to concerns regarding cost and availability, both in terms of quantity and location. Nonetheless, following fruitful negotia- tions with a key partner, MSC began a series of biofuel trials in 2019. The trials focused on the use of a blend of fuel oil and ISCC31 certified UCOME (Used Cooking Oil Methyl Ester) biofuel. UCOME biofuel is made from used vegetable oils, fats or greases. The resulting biofuel can be used, in the form of a blend of biofuel and petroleum-based fuel, in diesel engines without engine modification.
Trials were run with the selected biofuel on two MSC ships, and performance was evaluated against criteria relating to machinery function, fuel viscosity, sulphur emissions and cold climate impacts, for example.

 ENVIRONMENTAL SPOTLIGHT ON MSC’S GÜLSÜN CLASS SHIPS
CONTRIBUTING TO MEETING GLOBAL AIR POLLUTION TARGETS
The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), overseen by the IMO, limits the primary air pollutants contained in exhaust gas from ships, including nitrous oxides (NOx). NOx has adverse impacts on human health and the natural environment. High levels of NOx in the atmosphere causes respiratory conditions with impacts on lung function; in plants, NOx in high concentrations has a negative effect on leaves and growth. NOx has been steadily increasing in concentration globally33, particu- larly in areas with high levels of motorised transport. MARPOL Annex VI details progressive reductions in NOx emissions limits from marine diesel engines. Tier III emissions standards apply to all ships built after 1st January 201634, for trading in North American emission control areas (ECAs) and the United States Caribbean Sea ECA, and 1st January 2021 for ships operating in the Baltic Sea ECA and North Sea ECA. The standards call for an 80% reduction relative to earlier Tier I standards. MSC fully supports IMO-led efforts to curb atmospheric pollutants, including NOx, and has been investing in Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology which can lower ship NOx emissions from about 650ppm to 10-40ppm (80-95%). Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is an emissions control technology whereby a reduc- ing agent (ammonia, in the form of urea) reacts with a catalyst in the exhaust stream of an engine. The ensuing chemical reaction converts nitrogen oxides principally into harmless nitrogen and water, which are expelled through the exhaust funnel.
The first five MSC Josseline class vessels were delivered in 2019. These ships, along with the four due for delivery in 2020, are the first of the MSC fleet with IMO MARPOL
NOx Tier III compliant engines. MSC partnered with leading maritime technology providers to ensure the SCR systems installed use the most reliable, safest and most effective designs for each ship class. Safety and operational training on the use of the SCR is provided to all crew concerned. Already, as per the regulation, all new MSC ships calling at ports in the North American ECA and the United States Caribbean Sea ECA use SCR for NOx control when these requirements apply.
On her maiden voyage in July 2019, MSC Jewel from the Josseline class vessels called at the Port of Long Beach. The Port is a leader in tackling air emissions and associ- ated health risks. The Clean Air Action Plan35 Update, approved at Long Beach in 2017, provides guidance on achieving a zero-emissions future, while safeguarding and reinforcing the port’s strong economic position. MSC Jewel is a new 14,436 TEU vessel equipped with shore power connection capability, powered by Tier III diesel engines in conjunction with SCR, which are 75 per cent cleaner than the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Tier II standard. She was welcomed as the “clean- est container ship to visit the United States” by the Long Beach Harbour Commission President on 12th July 2019.. MSC was also awarded for MSC Jewel’s visit through the Port of Long Beach Green Ship Incentive Program.
PARTNERING FOR CLEAN SHIPPING TECHNOLOGY
In 2019, MSC entered a partnership with the South Coast Air Quality Management Directive (AQMD)36 in California. It was agreed that in 2020, together with another partner, MAN Energy Solutions USA Inc. (MAN), MSC and AQMD will develop, install and demonstrate a retrofit technology to reduce NOx emissions from ocean-going vessels (OGVs). For the proposed project, the retrofit technology will be installed, tested and demonstrated on one of MSC’s Tier II vessels.
2019 was a landmark year in the world of container shipping, especially for MSC, and especially for environ- mental performance. The year saw the coming into service of the first 10 of the MSC Gülsün class 23K+ TEU ships, currently the largest container ships afloat. In August, MSC Gülsün, the first in this new class of ships, made its maiden voyage from the North of China to Europe.
These Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULCVs) can carry over 4,500 more 20 ft containers (TEUs) than the previ- ous class, MSC’s 19,000+ TEU Oscar class ships, which were already high-performing in terms of fuel and energy efficiency. This new class of 23,000+ TEU ship builds on the previous innovative design, maximising operational and environmental performance. At some 400 metres long and more than 60 metres wide, the Gülsün class ships have a record capacity for a contain- er ship: 23,756 TEU. Due to the size, and technological innovations on board, this class of ship emits less CO2 per container carried, helping companies which ship goods on MSC’s services between Asia and Europe to
lower the carbon footprint of their supply chains. Their deployment is part of MSC’s efforts to help ensure our customers have sufficient service on the world’s major trade lanes between Asia and Europe.
The MSC Gülsün class ships feature a remarkable approach to energy efficiency with the shape of the bow designed to enhance hydrodynamics by reducing hull resistance. State-of-the-art engineering minimises wind resistance, resulting in lower fuel consumption. The ship’s improved energy efficiency and fuel economy help ensure that MSC is on track to meet international 2030 emissions reduction targets set by IMO ahead of time, building on a 13% improvement in CO2 emissions per ton of cargo moved already achieved across the MSC fleet between 2015 and 2018.
To comply with the IMO 2020 sulphur regulation, each of the ships is equipped with a UN IMO-approved hybrid Exhaust Gas Cleaning System (EGCS) and can switch to low-sulphur fuel when necessary; the vessels can also be adapted for liquefied natural gas (LNG) use in the future.

   CASE STUDY
GLOBAL LEADERS IN SHORE POWER
Ports are highly dynamic economic and logistic hubs, where shipping companies, such as MSC, play a key role in the movement of goods. Trade volumes across the world have increased substantially in recent decades, from approximately USD 10 trillion in 2005 to USD 17.5 trillion in 201737. In parallel with this, air pollution in ports from ocean-going vessels, as well as trucks, locomotives and other vehicles in operation at terminals, has also increased. Even when a ship is at port, though it does not need energy for propulsion, other ship functions such as ventila- tion, heating, cooling, pumps and control systems still require power. Running generators to provide this power can contribute to local noise and air emissions with impacts on public health. MSC is very aware of this and has been a strong advocate of the use of shore power to reduce emissions from ships in ports, contributing to SDG 3, Good Health and Well-Being, and in particular Target 3.938. All new MSC vessels are built with shore-power connection capability. At the end of 2019, a total of 173 vessels were equipped.
SYSTEMIC GROWTH OF THE COLD-IRONING INFRASTRUCTURE
Some of the world’s largest, most sophisticated and most modern ports in the world are in China. In fact, China is home to six of the world’s busiest ports. The Chinese government has spent ¥ 1 trillion since 2012 to expand the country’s port facilities. Part of this included investment in measures to combat urban air pollution. All main port terminals were requested to install shore power to reduce emissions. Eight major ports in China now offer cold-ironing (shore power), with some ports providing this at multiple berths.
MSC CHINA CONNECTS TO SHORE POWER
Shenzhen, a major urban centre in Guangdong province, is a leader in China in the provision of shore power. For example, connections are available at 16 (80%) of
the berths at Yantian International Container Terminal (YICT) in Shenzhen. The infrastructure in place has an output of 60Hz, which corresponds to a potential reduc- tion of vessel-related CO2 emissions by an estimated 3,500 tons/year, as well as 10 tons/year of SO2 and 70 tons/year of NOx.
MSC China has been swift to use the shore-power connections in Shenzhen. Of the 670 port calls that used shore power in Shenzhen in 2019, 283 (42%) were made by MSC vessels, making MSC the primary shore-power user in Shenzhen. Of the 459 calls made by shore-power equipped MSC vessels to terminals in Shenzhen in 2019, 283 voyages connected to the available shore-power infrastructure, representing over 62% of all MSC calls; an increase of 10% is expected in 2020.

The above sections explain the lengths to which MSC is going to reduce emissions. We continue to make progress in this area and are confident that technologi- cal breakthroughs will help the sector achieve the IMO emissions reduction objectives. However, despite all the efforts to increase the energy efficiency of vessels, marine transportation of goods currently still causes unavoidable CO2 emissions. To offer an interim solution to compensate for these unavoidable emissions, MSC has partnered with a world leader in the development of emissions reduction and renewable energy projects, South Pole39. Since early 2019, MSC has been offering
39 www.southpole.com/
its clients the possibility to compensate for their cargo’s environmental impact through the purchase of offsets, which direct funds to two emission reduction projects with verified environmental and social benefits. Carbon certificates are then generated, which are audited and third-party certified according to the most stringent international standards. MSC was the first liner carri- er in the industry to offer certified offsets to customers.

  CASE STUDY
ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE AT TiL: A FOCUS ON PRODUCTIVITY
Container terminals provide the essential interface between the container shipping industry and landside multi- modal logistics and distribution networks. A business as complex as this may have various environmental impacts, but these can be managed responsibly to ensure an overall positive contribution to the local port community and broader economy. Since it was founded in 2000, Terminal Investment Limited (TiL) has grown to become one of the largest and most geographically diverse container terminal operators in the world. The company has material ownership interests in 38 operating terminals and two development terminals in 26 countries on five continents. There are 11 MSC Terminals under TiL management. TiL works to apply principles of eco-efficiency throughout its operations, i.e. value generation through technology application and process optimisation, while also minimising resource use and environmental impact. TiL has become a market leader through strong and consistent business performance, strategic investment at many of the world’s busiest ports, prioritisation of health and safety and an environmental approach which integrates sustainability considerations with high productivity.
typically segregate waste voluntarily (e.g. paper, plastic, glass, wood, fluorescent tubes, metals, used oil and electronics) for disposal and recycling, where facilities are available. Only authorised vendors are engaged to handle waste, which is processed and documented according to national guidelines. All TiL greenfield projects are designed and implemented in accordance with relevant International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability40. Examples of our social and environmental risk impact assessments and management systems can be found in the “Social Inclusion” chapter of our 2018 Sustainability Report (pages 26-39). A total of 15 terminals across the world that are either managed or co-managed by TiL are ISO 14001 certified. These sites have adopted a recog- nised framework for the establishment of a site-based environmental management system. This enables them to identify, manage, monitor and control their environ- mental priorities in an integrated way.
TiL-owned terminals and joint ventures are also working to attain globally recognised energy management standards through the development of formal energy management systems (EnMS). Asyaport in Tekirdag, Turkey, Klaipedos Smelte in Klaipeda, Lithuania and MSCTV in Valencia, Spain have already been ISO 50001 certified in recognition of their progress. This certifica- tion is a key element in integrating energy management into broader site-level efforts to improve quality and environmental management. Asyaport and MSCTV have both also received the European Port Environmental Review System (PERS) certification, the only port sector- specific environmental management standard. In North America, three terminals (New Orleans Terminal LLC, PET Port Everglades and Termont Montreal) have been awarded GreenMarine certifications for their exemplary environmental performance, following assessment on performance indicators focused on air, land and water pollution.
FOCUSING ON PRODUCTIVITY
At TiL, the sustainability approach is characterised by a focus on boosting productivity. Sustainable operations require strategic planning and careful management of inputs and outputs; the same is true for productivity. By focusing on productivity metrics, TiL is also achiev- ing reductions in fuel use, optimising use of quay and yard space, reducing machine wear and cutting truck idling time.
Since 2006, the cargo handled by TiL has more than quadrupled, to 33 million moves in 2019. This excel- lent performance is a result of consistently high-quality service and strong partnerships combined with capaci- ty expansion projects. TiL records and monitors a range of energy efficiency indicators to ensure that its strong business performance runs in parallel with responsible environmental management. For example, TiL has achieved a 14% increase in the number of TEU moved per quay metre and a 16% increase in the number of TEU moved per hectare of yard space, since the end of 2016.
Fuel consumption per move at TiL has been reduced by 25% since 2017. In a further reflection of improvements in operational efficiency, berth productivity, measured in terms of the number of moves per hour, has increased from 55 in 2016 to 60 in 2019.
A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO SITE-LEVEL ECO-EFFICIENCY
The optimisation of operations by TiL has wider benefits for emissions reduction, beyond the company itself. For instance, average truck turnaround time at TiL terminals has been reduced by six minutes (15%) since 2016, meaning less time idling or queueing. TiL works to ensure a smooth service to the trucking community and to deliver this in tandem with superior waterside service.
Broader environmental responsibility is practised by TiL at site level through, inter alia, compliance with applica- ble and relevant domestic and local laws, as in the case of waste management for example. Offices and workshops

MSC is constantly seeking business, technical and operational innovations to improve our service and reduce our ecological footprint.
TAKING ON THE PLASTICS CHALLENGE
MSC is working to ensure that we do not contribute to the widespread problem of marine plastics, and that our activities support SDG 14, and particularly target 14.142. An estimated eight million tons of plastics enter the world’s oceans every year, causing serious injury or death to marine wildlife43. Plastic pollution also contrib- utes to climate change, and puts human health, coastal tourism, and food safety and security at risk.
In addition to the provisions of the IMO’s MARPOL Annex V, with which all ships must comply, banning plastic disposal from ships anywhere at sea, countries are also imposing national-level measures to curb plastic waste. For example, in late 2019, Kuwait announced its policy to prohibit the use of certain single-use plastic items onboard Kuwaiti and foreign ships while in port in Kuwait or in Kuwaiti waters. India is also introduc- ing similar measures, in a phased approach. MSC’s primary approach has always been to focus initially on plastic reduction, through engagement and negotiation
with product suppliers. Further, MSC’s commitment to ensure ISO 14001 compliance has led to the establish- ment by MSC Shipmanagement of robust, externally audited procedures for onboard waste management for all ships in our fleet. Waste generated on board our vessels is gathered, sorted and deposited at ports where MSC has partnerships with certified third parties for appropriate disposal in accordance with local waste management regulations. MSC works to instil aware- ness about plastic waste through the Company’s Quality, Safety and Environment Management System (QSEMS), providing regular crew briefings on the need for plastic waste management, as well as the recycling procedures onboard.
In 2019, MSC Shipmanagement also made the firm commitment to reduce single-use plastics (mainly in packaging material, including bottles) onboard all of its vessels. As part of this initiative, MSC now procures concentrated water-based cleaning agents, for which the solution is prepared on board, resulting in a significant reduction of plastic waste generation. For example, the use of a dilutable concentrate available in a 10-litre drum can produce 1,000 litres of ready-to-use (RTU) solution, thereby replacing 1,000 smaller 1 litre plastic containers.

DIGITALISATION FOR ACHIEVING THE SDGs
MSC is a modern, global company both in spirit and practice. We are forward-thinking and moving with and adapting to the changing world around us. For these reasons, we are driving and supporting digital solutions to facilitate collaboration and transparency across our global operations and within the broader shipping sector.
BOOSTING GLOBAL TRADE
Expanding global trade is essential for reducing poverty44. By boosting economic growth, trade enables the realisation of a number of SDGs, allows access to technological input and creates incentives for innova- tion. MSC’s worldwide transport services facilitate trade primarily by interconnecting global markets. But the benefits of trade are only sustainable and equitable when systems are in place to allow for information sharing, and to overcome trade barriers such as lack of standardisation. Digital technologies, part of what is sometimes referred to as the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’, are one of the six transformations required to achieve the SDGs45. The 2019 CEO Study conducted by the UN Global Compact46 also revealed that digital technologies are considered one of the primary ways in which companies can contribute to the SDGs. For logistics and mobility alone, it is estimated that digital solutions could abate 3.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)47. But like any enabler of sustainabil- ity, this transformation requires deep, long-term and coordinated investment to succeed, and this is an area in which MSC is currently active.
COLLABORATION AND SECTOR BENEFITS
Players in the aviation sector have been benefitting from collaboration for some years. For historical reasons, the shipping sector is still gaining momentum in this area, and MSC is working hard to support this. For example, MSC has committed to a leadership role in the Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA)48. Together with other leading shipping companies, through the DCSA, MSC is helping to establish standards for a common technology foundation that enables global collabora- tion, the scalability of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, operational efficiencies and interoperability. The broader goal is to make shipping services easy to use, flexible, efficient, reliable and environmentally friendly49.
A major achievement of the DCSA in 2019 was the publi- cation of the ‘Industry Blueprint’, agreed upon by nine of the largest carriers in the world. It defines more than 50 shipping ‘events’, relating to berthing and mooring for example. This enables carriers and customers to have a precise, shared and agreed understanding of events through the use of common terminology. Also, in 2019, with the objective of reliably sharing requirements and specifications for IoT solutions installed on containers, DCSA began work on a specific track to address the communication technology layers of IoT solutions. This work aligns with MSC’s investment in smart container technology described below.
The rise of new digital platforms such as TradeLens are of considerable interest to MSC. Tradelens is a blockchain-enabled digital platform collaboration between IBM and some of the shipping sector’s largest actors, including MSC. Our involvement in TradeLens is a further sign of MSC’s commitment to greater trust and collaboration across supply chains. MSC will continue to explore opportunities to use such platforms and other digital tools that drive efficiency, improve the service we offer to clients and meet our business needs.
TradeLens offers visibility to its members, enabling them to connect and exchange information across the full shipping supply chain50. The platform offers users a means to access data and to collaborate as cargo is shipped around the world, helping create a secured, transparent and incontrovertible record of transac- tions. Today there are more than 100 participants in
TradeLens, and over 10 million discrete shipping events and thousands of documents are processed every week. The shared visibility that the platform provides helps to build trust between carriers, shippers, customs author- ities, port officials, freight forwarders and other players across the shipping value chain.
 MSC is also represented in the Port Call Optimisation (PCO) Task Force. PCO draws on existing industry standards and is backed by a range of organisations internationally recognised for their deep knowledge of the shipping sector and standards. The PCO Task Force is working towards the long-term goal of interoperability between shipping lines, agents, ports and, where applicable, other associated
industries. The broader purpose is to streamline port call planning and execution and to reduce unnecessary waiting time. MSC is working closely with the DCSA on the topic of PCO to help achieve these important goals.

CUSTOMER BENEFITS
Shared visibility (SV)51 (common situational awareness) is one of the benefits of digitisation and digitalisation52. It allows not only for business optimisation but, in the case of the shipping sector, it offers the ability to track the whereabouts of cargo. Nowadays, improvements in cloud and mobile technologies, together with the Internet of Things (IoT), are making it possible to offer customers the visibility they demand in order to better plan their operations. MSC was one of the early backers of Traxens, a French company, which provides tracking capabilities for dry containers and also provides security features such as alerts in response to door opening, shocks or changes in humidity and temperature, for example. Traxens was purposely designed to improve transparency and control in the container shipping sector using IoT and Big Data. ‘Smart assets’, which include dry containers, reefers and trailers, can be tracked using embedded sensors which capture various
physical parameters and provide information on the status and movement of the container. These assets are linked digitally to a monitoring platform. This allows for delivery predictions and deviation alerts which provide important information on trip status and progress. MSC is expanding its work on smart technologies in the knowledge that such innovation brings greater custom- er confidence, with simultaneous gains for safety, efficiency and carbon footprint, arising from more seamless integration. Ancillary environmental benefits of improved tracking and tracing of containers include increased defence against illegal wildlife trade. This kind of optimisation of business processes is part of the broader pursuit of efficiency and best practice which underpin MSC’s environmental approach. In 2019, MSC invested in smart technology for 10,000 reefer (refriger- ated unit) containers, in response to shippers’ demand for innovation.

 C 15
Just in Time Arrival (JIT) is a concept that has been successfully implemented in other industries such as manufacturing. In the context of the maritime sector, it describes how ships may optimise their voyage speed to arrive at the port when availability of the berth, fairway and port nautical services (e.g. pilots and tugs) is assured. The benefits of JIT Arrival are increased safety, reduced environmental footprint and cost reduction. However, a prerequisite for JIT Arrival is real-time data exchange, which requires agreed data standards and a common language. To this end, MSC is participating in an interna- tional task force promoting Port Call Optimisation (PCO)
JUST IN TIME ARRIVAL
which is currently focused on improving the quality and availability of master and event data. JIT Arrival of ships contributes to GHG emissions reduction and air quality improvement in two primary ways:
• Voyage optimisation: Engine efficiency and associ- ated fuel consumption reductions are achieved through optimised sailing speeds
• Reduced manoeuvring and anchorage time:
The approach to port and waiting time at anchor is minimised. (It is estimated that ships may spend 5-10% of their time at sea waiting to call at port53)
PORT CALL OPTIMISATION: JUST IN TIME ARRIVAL TRIAL
MSC is a strong supporter of the emissions reduction targets of the IMO. Resolution MEPC.304(75) (from the IMO Maritime Environment Protection Committee (MEPC)) on the Initial IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships sets out a vision for reducing and eventually eliminating GHGs from the shipping sector. One of the measures presented in the Strategy includes the optimisation of the logistic chain and its planning, including ports. As the interface between the sea and the land, ports play a central role in the broader supply chain. MSC is actively participating in collaborative digital and data-based projects involving ports through its membership of the Global Industry Alliance (GIA), a public-private initiative, established under the framework of the GEF-UNDP-IMO GloMEEP.
MULTIPLE ADVANTAGES ACROSS
THE COMPANY
Digital technologies can raise productivity, lower produc- tion costs, reduce emissions, expand access, and make public services more readily available. However, MSC recognises that returns on investment in digitisation only follow when those investments are targeted and strategic; only practical projects bring tangible benefits. MSC’s Real-Time Monitoring system is one example of a project with highly actionable outputs that benefit the environment. Our Real-Time Monitoring system provides diagnostic information about ship perfor- mance to the masters and to Shipmanagement teams. This informs decisions on which retrofit or operational measures could be applied to optimise energy use and thereby reduce emissions, as well as to reduce costs. Across the Company, MSC is moving towards more efficient, inter-connected and less resource-intensive digital technologies. We have established strategic
partnerships with a range of IT service providers to develop practical solutions that bring real value to customers by, for example, reducing administrative burden and paper-based documentation processes. One such internal initiative is OneVision. OneVision is a collection of centrally coordinated projects involv- ing Agencies and Headquarters to streamline global business processes, standardise data flows and harmo- nise the management of our systems.
Digital transformation and sustainability present an array of opportunities to companies ready to learn and move with the times. MSC is pleased to operate at the convergence of these two forces. We believe that this is another way we can help to promote prosperity, drive efficiency and drive the development of clean technol- ogies and greener operations.
     Route Enhanced Ship to ship Port call Port call Optimisation monitoring route exchange synchronisation optimisation
In 2019, MSC participated in a desktop trial in JIT Arrival ship operations at the Port of Rotterdam, led by the Global Industry Alliance (GIA). During the desktop exercise, a 247 nautical mile voyage between Bremerhaven and Rotterdam was simulated in various scenarios. First, a “business as usual” scenario was modelled, i.e. the ship received an update regarding requested arrival time at the pilot boarding place at the first ‘Calling In Point’ (typically about 30 nautical miles from port, when the ship is within radio communica- tion range). In the second scenario, under JIT Arrival conditions, the ship received regular updates earlier in
53 https://portcalloptimization.org/
the voyage on when the ship was requested to arrive at the pilot boarding place. The ship could then adjust to its optimum speed. When compared, 23% less fuel was consumed in the JIT scenario. The study also pointed to other likely opportunities to reduce emissions, namely through (i) increasing the ship’s draught and (ii) reducing the port stay duration. These measures offer signifi- cant fuel consumption reduction potential, with ancillary benefits for GHG emissions and port air quality. The consolidated findings of the GIA roundtables will be presented in a Guide on JIT Arrival for delivery in 2020.

REEFERS: INVESTING TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS
NOISE REDUCTION
The number of oceangoing vessels, both commercial and recreational, is increasing worldwide. In tandem with this, underwater noise is on the rise in many global regions. This can have a detrimental effect on marine life57. Noise from ships and other motorised maritime vehicles can impact the ability of cetaceans (i.e. whales, dolphins and porpoises) to detect prey, communicate, navigate, rest, avoid danger, mate and reproduce58. Propeller cavitation, the biggest source of underwater noise from a ship, is generated as the propeller turns in water. The turning of the propeller causes chang- es in pressure on propeller leading and trailing edges, resulting in the bursting of many tiny water bubbles. In April 2014, based on work carried out by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), the IMO published guidelines59 on this subject. Design consid- erations for propellers were provided, in addition to other technical (e.g. hull design, engine mounting and selection of onboard machinery) and operational (e.g. propeller cleaning and ship speed) measures for noise reduction.
The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 14% of food produced annually for human consumption worldwide is lost during the post-harvest production stage, before reaching the retail stage of the food system54. This presents a significant sustain- able development challenge, particularly with respect to SDG 2, Zero Hunger. Unsustainable food production and supply have related or indirect impacts on other SDGs related to, for example, water use, biodiversity protection and soil degradation. To help draw attention to these issues, the UN General Assembly nominated 29th September as International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste.
The global demand for fresh fruit is growing steadily. In 2018, it reached a total volume of 868 million metric tonnes55. Meeting this global demand at a time of climate concern and ever-higher customer expectations requires planning, investment and innovative transport solutions, and MSC excels in all of these areas.
REDUCING FOOD LOSS AND WASTAGE
MSC is a market leader in delivering fruits and vegeta- bles in excellent condition to customers across the world. In 2019, MSC transported more than 1.8 million TEU of reefer cargo. MSC’s services go well beyond the port too, as we also offer inland transport by road, rail and barge. The commitment to cargo-specific delivery services extends to MSC’s intermodal network, ensur- ing that high-quality produce is reliably transported to coastal and inland destinations to the standard the growers expect.
In 2018, MSC invested in reefer containers equipped with Controlled Atmosphere (CA) system technology, and in containers chilled by an innovative, sustainable refriger- ation system. ln 2019, adding a new dimension to MSC’s reefer shipping abilities, MSC expanded the fleet with the addition of 5,000 new Star Cool CATM reefer units, following a three-year trial period on closed services
54 www.fao.org/publications/sofa/en/ 55 www.statista.com
56 www.unido.org
and dedicated service routes. Compared to conventional reefer containers, the integrated Star Cool CATM refrig- eration system offers a lighter, more energy-efficient reefer container with higher capacity, without compro- mising strength or reliability.
The O2 and CO2 levels in these reefers can be regulated independently to prolong the ripening process, thus keeping fruit fresher for longer. For perishable fruit, this is particularly valuable in reducing loss due to over- ripening during transport. This also allows for a wider range of destinations to be reached, and thus more markets accessed with deliveries of fresh fruit.
EMISSIONS REDUCTION IN THE COLD CHAIN
MSC has been thorough in ensuring compliance with the Kigali Amendment, which came into effect on 1st January 201956 following ratification by 65 countries. The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer will help reduce the production and consumption of hydrofluor- ocarbons (HFCs), which are potent greenhouse gases (GHGs).
2019 saw the installation of StarConomy tempera- ture control software by MSC on its entire StarCool fleet, reducing energy consumption by up to 50%. Furthermore, the ability of these reefers to keep food cooler for longer gives MSC clients a wider range of transport modes to choose from, potentially avoiding air freight, with associated benefits in terms of costs and emissions reduction.
Mindful of the need for a closed-loop approach to the use of materials, MSC is selecting reefers that can be recycled when they reach their end-of-life. MSC believes that further improvements in environmentally sound transport will be achieved, and we will continue to work with technology providers as well as local growers, farmers and producers to provide tailor-made servic- es to meet the food needs of consumers worldwide.
Although the propeller boss cap fins (PBCF) are primarily known for their energy-saving merits, as explained on page 65, their installation reduces propeller cavitation and consequently underwater noise. This is a positive and noteworthy secondary effect of MSC’s propeller retrofit campaign, started in 2012. Having confirmed the performance of the PBCFs, MSC Shipmanagement decided to install them on the entire managed fleet as part of the propeller retrofit programme.
The Port of Vancouver authority-led Enhancing Cetacean Habitat and Observation60 (ECHO) programme is a collab- orative research initiative that aims to better understand and reduce the cumulative effects of shipping on at-risk whales in the region. This includes the northern resident killer whales, humpback, fin, blue and sei whales. In recognition of the value of PBCFs from a nature conser- vation perspective, since January 2017, PBCFs has been recognised by the Port of Vancouver as an approved device for reducing underwater noise. Vessels fitted with this technology are awarded a discount in harbour dues. A large part of the MSC-owned fleet has already been fitted with PBCFs, and further propeller retrofits are ongoing.

MEETING AND EXCEEDING THE STANDARDS
ISO CERTIFICATIONS
  MSC customers deserve the utmost clarity when it comes to understanding how our Company operates. Demonstrating through voluntary certification that our procedures, policies and operations meet global bench- marks for excellence is one of the main ways that we can prove to our stakeholders that we hold ourselves to high standards that are externally verified. Adherence to International Organization for Standardization (ISO)61 standards also helps companies, such as MSC, to contribute to the SDGs, by providing guidelines and frameworks for key sustainability topics such as energy efficiency and environmental management.
MSC follows an extensive programme of work to reach and maintain the ISO standards. The programme includes meeting fundamental expectations of our clients, such as ISO 9001 (2015) certification for quality management, to more recent certifications for ISO 28000 (security management system for the supply chain). This is a reflection of the heightened measures put in place by MSC for security along the shipping supply chain, and demonstration of precautions taken to avoid delays rising from the seizure of illegal cargo.

PROTECTING MARINE LIFE
The melting of polar ice is a serious environmen- tal concern for multiple reasons. For example, ice and snow reflect the sun’s energy back into space in what is known as the albedo effect, which helps to keep Earth cool; melting of large tracts of land-based ice causes sea levels to rise, putting populations in regions close to sea level at risk across the world; thawing permafrost releases large amounts of CO2, exacerbating climate change. MSC is deeply concerned by these impacts and the implica- tions for people and wildlife, and accordingly, has taken a strong position on the use of the Northern Sea Route. The Northern Sea Route connects Europe with Asia through Arctic waters, which until now have typically been blocked by year-round sea ice. The Route has been heralded by some as an opportunity for new commer- cial shipping lanes with additional potential for fossil fuel extraction. MSC will not use the Northern Sea Route for container shipping. MSC prides itself on a long nautical heritage and passion for the sea; entry into these Arctic waters would contravene these deeply held principles. We believe that efforts should be focused on limiting environmental emissions and protecting the marine environment, and that the 21 million containers that we move each year can be transported through existing shipping global trade routes.
RESPECTING WILDLIFE AND ECOSYSTEMS
All over the world, human populations are dependent on healthy oceans for food, jobs, climate regulation and economic wellbeing; the environmental, economic, social, cultural and spiritual value of healthy oceans is staggering. For example, an estimated one billion people in developing countries rely on seafood for their primary source of protein62. MSC is concerned about ocean biodiversity and environmental degradation and is actively involved in a number of projects aimed at protecting marine ecosystems.
THE MULTIPLE BENEFITS OF BIOCIDE-FREE ANTI-FOULING
Anti-fouling refers to the protection of a vessel’s hull from marine growth through the application of a layer of protective paint. MSC complies with the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems in Ships (‘AFS Convention’), which entered into force in September 2008 and prohibits the use of harmful anti-fouling paints and other anti-fouling systems that contain harmful biocidal substances. MSC also implements an internal policy requiring the surface preparation of each ship’s hull every five years.
MSC is working in collaboration with leading coating manufacturers to stay abreast of improvements in low-friction anti-fouling paints. MSC’s trials of silicon coating on vessel propellers more than a decade ago led to a decision by MSC to apply silicon paints on rudders fleetwide, except where locational or other factors prevent this. This practice has brought multiple advantages, including time and cost saving for routine cleaning, as well as the reduction of scrapings and residues from underwater cleaning which may contain microplastics, invasive species and biocides, which can all potentially affect the marine environment. MSC will continue to explore technologies and partnerships for further efficiency and environmental gains through the use of novel hull treatment and coatings.
SUPPORTING WILDLIFE PROTECTION CAMPAIGNS
MSC is pleased to partner with various organisations whose work is focused on the protection of wildlife on land and in the sea. For example, we are signatories of the Buckingham Declaration Against Wildlife Trafficking, a pledge to combat illicit wildlife tracking, and have a zero-tolerance policy on the trade of endangered species or banned wildlife products. Throughout 2019, MSC continued its participation in the United for Wildlife63 Task Force whose work is focused on combatting illegal wildlife trade (IWT). We are continuously strengthening our systems to identify and trace illegal shipments of goods, including IWT.
In 2019, MSC became a member of the North American Marine Environment Protection Association (NAMEPA). NAMEPA is a marine industry-led organisation of environmental stewards preserving the marine environ- ment by promoting sustainable marine industry best practices and educating seafarers, students and the public about the need and strategies for protecting global ocean, lake and river resources64.
In 2019, as in 2018, MSC received an award from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration65 (NOAA) for voluntary vessel speed reduction in Cordell Bank and Greater Fallarones National Marine Sanctuaries, where endangered whale species feed. MSC was placed in the top ‘Sapphire’ performance category (75% or more of distance travelled at 10 knots or less). The speed reduction programme goals are not only to improve air quality, but also to reduce the poten- tial for fatal whale strikes, which are one cause of whale injury and mortality worldwide. MSC’s involvement in other wildlife protection activities is coordinated through the MSC Foundation66, for which environmental conser- vation is a core project area.
COLLABORATING ON INCIDENT RESPONSE AND INVESTIGATION
On 2nd January 2019, 342 containers were lost in the North Sea from the MSC Zoe during very heavy weather. The Company immediately began an unprecedented response effort and has continued to work closely with Dutch and German authorities to perform extensive mapping of the seabed, recover items from the North Sea, and remove related debris from the surrounding shoreline. The relevant authorities are continuing their investigative efforts, and MSC will apply information and conclusions drawn from those investigations to minimise the risk of any future container losses at sea.

 SHIP RECYCLING
The large amount of steel and other metals from end-of-life ships can be recycled or re-used to produce other finished products, helping to reduce pressure on natural resources. According to the European Commission, “the recycling of scrap metals from ships also reduces the need for mining, an environmentally damaging practice. In this way, it is a vital part of the circular economy – which purports to minimise waste and recycle some materials infinitely.”67 Additionally, the ship recycling industry contributes consid- erably to the creation of thousands of much-needed employment opportunities and to boosting inclusive local economic development in a number of countries, such as Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Turkey.
STATUS OF SHIP RECYCLING REGULATIONS: MAIN CHALLENGES
community and its importance is now widely recog- nised. Significant steps have been taken to extend regulatory measures aimed at promoting greener and more sustainable practices, such as the EU Ship Recycling Regulation (EUSRR) 2013. Yet, at this stage, there is no global regulatory framework in force to ensure a level playing field for all stakeholders involved. In this respect, the 2009 IMO Hong Kong Convention on the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships, known as the Hong Kong Convention (IMO HKC), has not yet entered into force and challenges in implement- ing responsible environmental and labour practices in the yards remain. Due to the significant growth of the world’s merchant fleet68 (as shown in the graph below) and other market factors, an increase in the number of ships being recycled may be expected in the near future. Thus, there is a need to enhance the availability of yards operating in compliance with the relevant internationally recognised standards.
PROMOTING RESPONSIBLE SHIP RECYCLING PRACTICES
In the absence of a consistent and systematic approach to responsible ship recycling practices at the global level, MSC has taken proactive steps, striving to ensure that the recycling of materials and ship components are performed at yards without any unnecessary risk to human health, safety or the environment.
MSC has an excellent track record in vessel mainte- nance, which makes it possible to extend the life of its vessels in many cases. Additionally, in line with its Ship Recycling Policy (available at www.msc.com/che/ sustainability/ship-recycling-policy), MSC adheres to the relevant provisions of the IMO HKC and its relevant recycling standards, from design, construction and operation to the preparation of ships for the end of their operational cycle.
Also, in taking the decision to recycle a vessel, MSC requires that the recycling yard complies with the relevant provisions of the IMO HKC Convention. MSC would blacklist any buyer of its vessels which does not comply with the Company’s high standards, as well as the provisions contained in its sale contracts in relation to green ship recycling processes and proce- dures. Additionally, in line with its Ship Recycling Policy, MSC periodically conducts on-site audits to monitor the recycling yards it uses. These audits include an assess- ment of the working conditions of yard employees.
As an illustration, during its recent visit to the ship recycling facility located in Alang-Sosiyia, India, MSC was pleased to note significant improvements in terms of training and environmental stewardship put forward by the Gujrat Maritime Board (GMB), a state organisa- tion responsible for the infrastructure development of ship recycling yards along the coast of the province of Alang. GMB has focused on enhancing the training provided at the governmental ‘Safety Training Institute’, including basic safety awareness and skills training for gas cutting, as an example. Further investment by GMB in downstream waste handling, including incinerators, has helped achieve compliance with environmental standards. We are also pleased to report the further enhancement of a number of services for workers, such
as water and sanitation, housing and healthcare facili- ties. These aspects were highlighted for attention during previous visits by MSC, or by industry delegations. We believe those improvements arise from the accession to the IMO HKC and the adoption of the Recycling of Ships Act 2019.
IMPLEMENTING THE EUSRR ON BOARD VESSELS
In accordance with the EU Ship Recycling Regulation (EUSRR) 201371, MSC ensures that its ships calling at European ports have an Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM) on board. MSC began preparing its fleet five years ago to comply with this regulation. Each vessel now has an IHM formulated in line with the 2015 Guidelines for IHMs developed by the IMO, together with a statement of compliance issued by a recognised Classification Society. The IHM is considered a valua- ble tool not only for ensuring environmentally sound ship recycling processes and for better protecting yard employees, but also for enhancing health and safety measures for crew members working on board ships. Additionally, MSC procurement systems require that existing vendors, or potential new vendors, provide a signed Materials Declaration (MD) as well as a Supplier Declaration of Conformity for Material Declaration in line with the high standards set forth in its policies on the subject. This is a requirement for conducting business with MSC. As an illustration, MSC requires that all materials delivered on board be asbestos free. Recently, MSC has taken additional steps in its due diligence process as well, as in its responsible procure- ment practices, by contracting a third-party specialist company to assess and monitor its main suppliers’ facili- ties and the repair yards where the majority of its vessels come for repairs.

In this respect, in 2019, MSC welcomed the adoption of
with India’s ship recycling volume considerably contrib- uting to the required recycling capacity.”70 At present, 20 Indian recycling yards have made an application for their inclusion in the list under the EUSRR, which will allow vessels registered under the flag of European Union member states to be recycled at these facilities. We believe that this will provide further incentive for the Indian yards to continue upgrading their facilities.

ENSURING OUR PEOPLE ARE SAFE
MSC is not just about ships; people are at the epicentre of everything we do, and ensuring our people are safe and well is part of our purpose and one of our MSC Values72. It is also part of our commit- ment to promote responsible busGineRssAprPacHticIeCs, inF line with internationally recognised human rights and labour standards as well as with the SDGs 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing) and 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). In this respect, MSC takes a strong leadership role in ensuring that the health and safety of all seafarers and shore staff is prioritised. MSC safety procedures and policies are designed and implemented to exceed the requirements of international conventions and guidelines, most notably the International Safety Management Code73 (ISM), the Maritime Labour Convention74 (MLC) and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea1 (SOLAS). This same ethic applies to compliance with the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships2 (MARPOL), for matters relat- ing to environmental safety. MSC also believes that accident avoidance is a shared responsibility; everyone has a role to play in ensuring tasks are completed without incident. Therefore, we invest in training our employees on safety measures and procedures, and we promote open communica- tion on these issues as a basis for the continuous improvement of existing practices and procedures. Safety is a theme throughout MSC, on shore and on land, and appropriate measures are in place in each context to help ensure safe working spaces for all our employees. However, the following sections apply primarily to the safety of seafarers, whose operating conditions require particular attention to avoid accidents and injury.
SAFE AT SEA
In operational terms, our approach to safety at MSC is based on ten elements, observed for accident avoidance on our vessels.

74 www.ilo.org
90 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
 
          In addition, in accordance with each ship’s Cargo Securing Manual, all MSC crew engaged in cargo securing operations are trained in checking the proper securing of containers, the identification of defective equipment, manual handling skills, the handling of cables and other related aspects of operations that may pose a safety risk.
MSC SHIPMANAGEMENT: PROMOTING SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELFARE OF SEAFARERS
In addition to the coordination of all tasks related
to the technical management of vessels, MSC
Shipmanagement oversees the recruitment, training,
welfare, professional development and administrative
needs of our seafarers, in accordance with inter-
national standards. For example, together, MSC
recognised safety certification. However, regrettably, not all accidents are preventable, and occasional errors occur. In 2019 MSC Shipmanagement recorded one fatal accident. During 61,619,920 working hours, a total of 215 accidents occurred, of which 29 crew members (13%) required repatriation for treatment. A signifi- cant proportion of accidents recorded are due to trips, slips and falls, with other cases including contact with machinery and injury from falling objects. The two MSC Shipmanagement offices recorded lost time injury frequencies (LTIF) of 1.17 and 1.16.
As part of the mission to further embed a safety culture across our fleet, MSC Shipmanagement coordinates the safety training of MSC employees.
Some 12,834 crew members employed to work on MSC’s managed vessels received safety-related train- ing in 2019, amounting to 387,012 hours.
MSC Shipmanagement has been in receipt of multiple

LEADERSHIP IN CARGO SAFETY AND PREVENTATIVE INSPECTIONS
Loss prevention and avoidance of cargo-related incidents is a fundamental priority for MSC, and is part of our work to ensure the safety of our crew, our vessels and the marine environment in which we operate. While most shipping companies screen hazardous bookings, MSC is exceptional in its development and interlinking of an ever-increasing number of techni- cal and analytical solutions to produce a world-class screening system: the Dangerous, Sensitive Cargo Management System (DSCM).
While ISO certifications, notably ISO 9001: 2015, ISO 14001: 2015, demonstrate MSC’s commitment to cargo safety and security, the DSCM takes our performance to the next level of excellence. Each of the components which currently comprise the DSCM adds an addition- al layer of checks and intelligence to the system. For example, the MSC Cargo Inspection (MSCI) application was developed by MSC to make container inspections more targeted. It draws data from a wide range of sourc- es to screen bookings for risks. This in turn informs third-party inspection teams which containers to inves- tigate. MSCI has led to a more than 95% success rate in identification of mis-declared hazardous cargo in the flagged containers, thereby greatly reducing the chances of possible incidents. Wider recognition of the value of MSCI is evident in MSC’s receipt of the award for the ‘Most Sustainable Commitment to Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE)’ at the Green Shipping Summit in 2019. MSC also received fifth prize in the TT Club Innovation in Safety Award for its MSCI container cargo screening and inspection process.
One of the unique strengths of the DSCM is its consist- ently high reliability. Automated upload and screening
of documents using optical character recognition, algorithms and artificial intelligence ensure that the screening process is consistent and standardised. Automatic analysis of port, partner and vessel restric- tions by the system increase the level of safety checks and controls.
Speed is an outstanding feature of the DSCM. For example, the Reply Timer is a component of the system that measures how long it takes MSC to reply to customers when they place a hazardous booking. This feature indicates that MSC is substantially faster than others in the market at confirming these bookings. Furthermore, the Reply Timer provides KPIs that give feedback to MSC on system performance, which is valuable from the perspectives of quality assurance monitoring, as well as continuous improvement.
The strength of the DSCM lies not only in the efficacy and utility of the individual components, but the way in which they link and interact, contributing to an integrated and sophisticated screening system. For example, the identification of hazardous cargo by the system links to stowage and terminal space planning and segregation. Also, there are plans to incorporate container tracking and monitoring devices into the DSCM, to provide further intelligence on variables such as heat, light conditions and location of containers with hazardous cargo, to provide early warnings of possi- ble incidents.
MSC will continue to enhance the DSCM with additional components in the coming years, in parallel with our broader work on digitalisation (see page 76), to ensure we are serving our customers with cargo safety as a top priority. Our ambition is to continue to integrate existing technologies not yet linked to the system and to pursue our vision of ever-greater cargo safety and risk reduction.
Shipmanagement centres in Limassol, Cyprus and
Sorrento, Italy, are major centres for this work.

  CASE STUDY
SAFETY MEASURES ABOARD
THE MSC GÜLSÜN CLASS VESSELS
ADVANCED FIRE PREPAREDNESS
The MSC Gülsün Class vessels broke new ground in terms of crew and cargo safety because of the new dual-tower fire-fighting system with high-capacity pumps, which further enhance the safety of seafarers onboard and protect cargo carried across the whole deck of the ship. This equipment, which was designed and installed for the first time in the industry by the Company and certified by DNV-GL, a world leading classification society, shows clearly how responsible innovation represents a strategic asset. The approach pioneered by MSC to equip the vessel with an advanced fire-fighting system far beyond existing international regulations will guide the maritime industry to a higher safety level and lead the container shipping industry to a new standard.
The system offers three primary benefits:
• Crew: Large volumes of water pumped reduce the risk to crews by (i) reducing the spread of fire and (ii) improving the fire-fighting conditions. The system also enables crew to provide a faster response without needing to approach the fire, helping to contain a fire in the early stages
• Vessel and cargo: There is a cooling effect from the amount of water sprayed, reducing fire spread and further fire damage
• Customer: Increased cargo safety and thus reliability of service
Each of the enhanced fire-fighting systems installed on the funnel top and the compass deck features four new and additional long water jet monitors. The monitors can be rotated 360° and have a flow rate of 250m3/hour and a water spray reach which can extend up to 120m. There are four high pressure (15 bar) booster pumps on board that connect to the monitors, which increase water jet flow volume, and these pumps are supplied in turn with water by two ballast water pumps, each with a flow rate of 1000 m3/h.
In addition to the fire-fighting infrastructure installed on all the Gülsün Class ships, an innovative fire-detection system is being trialled on one ship. In this case, fixed thermal cameras are installed on the bridge and funnel, to monitor irregularities and alert the crew to poten- tial fires.
NEW FIRE SAFETY STANDARD AWARDED TO MSC
MSC is the first shipping line to be awarded a top new notation in relation to fire safety on board our container ships. The new notation from classification society DNV-GL highlights the strong systems in place across MSC’s Gülsün Class. The new fire safety notation, specif- ically aimed at container ships, is designed around a function-based approach, focusing on:
• enhanced safety level beyond present SOLAS requirements
• increased hazard awareness
• enhanced ability to detect and fight container fires
 MSC’s new 23,000+ TEU ships have broken records and set new standards in terms of size, efficiency and safety. However, such large vessels introduce a new suite of challenges related to fire prevention, navigation, cargo loading and discharging, maintenance and mooring.
ENHANCED FIXED FIRE-FIGHTING SYSTEM FOR ON-DECK CARGO
Fires on container ships can pose a serious risk to the lives of seafarers and the environment. As container ships have become larger in recent years, the volume of cargo carried on deck has also increased considerably, with associated implications for the fire risk to the
crew, vessel and the cargo itself. In response to this,
the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Chapter II-2 Regulation 10 has been revised in accordance with IMO Resolution MSC.365(93) to enhance portable fire-fighting equipment. However, misdeclaration of hazardous cargo and the incorrect stowing of hazardous cargo in containers warrant additional fire safety measures.
MSC’s ‘Gülsün Class’ of 23,000+ TEU ships are currently the largest container ships in the world. To ensure that onboard fire safety standards on these vessels extended beyond compliance with regulatory requirements, MSC decided to install the enhanced fixed fire-fighting system for on-deck cargo areas.

MSC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 95

             NAVIGATIONAL AND OPERATIONAL SAFETY
The great size of new ships creates additional considera- tions for navigation, especially in areas with high density traffic or congestion. Navigational actions are anticipated well in advance because the response time of larger vessels is longer than smaller ones. For the same reason, Masters of the MSC ships also plan anchoring particularly carefully, factoring in current and wind, for example. The large number of containers carried by these ships presents additional safety considerations for cargo loading and discharging procedures. Large ports may operate up to 11 gantry cranes at a time, the progress of which needs to be tracked simultaneously by duty officers and crew. Stowage of many containers on upper tiers also demands extra checks to ensure lashings are secure. Furthermore, with multiple gantry cranes operating at once, Masters and their crews must control listing of the ship through, for example, the judicious use of heeling tanks. Masters of these Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULCVs) also work to ensure adherence to MSC policy on maintaining an even keel on departure from port, which can be compli- cated by vessel length and squat effect. The large size and height of the cargo holds require thorough and meticu- lous inspection, which frequently must be undertaken with short turnaround times at ports, placing extra demands on the crew specially trained for this important task.
In addition to the fire-safety measures described on pages 94 and 95, further safety measures have been installed on these 23k+ TEU vessels. These include:
• the installation of 16 CCTV cameras on the deck and
in the engine room, some of which can be rotated and zoomed in and out for providing information on vessel clearance while berthing and unberthing
• ECDIS charts which can be overlaid on radar screens • entirely enclosed bridge with separate
air conditioning and heating
• hardened glass floor of bridge, for monitoring
pilot boarding and disembarking and for accurate
positioning of the gangway while berthing
• floating, lightweight, easy-to-handle mooring ropes • search lights which can be remotely operated
from bridge and moved through 360 degrees and
vertically, using a joystick
• two gangways on either side of the vessel for use
depending on vessel load condition
• lashing bridge ladders on extreme ends of the fifth
and sixth tiers with protective railings on fore and aft
sides to prevent falls
• location and configuration of fuel tanks, which avoids
ballast tank contamination
There is never any complacency when safety is concerned. MSC is continuously learning and noting design modifications that may further increase the safety on board our ships.
creation and evolution are important, MSC also ensures that jobs are meaningful, and that people have the tools and autonomy to succeed in their roles.
Finally, in keeping with the MSC family spirit, MSC takes the view that each crew member is a vital part of a ship’s team, and each ship is a vital part of the MSC fleet. We recognise hard work and performance through promo- tion, challenging assignments and talent development, to demonstrate to our seafarers that their individual jobs and professionalism contribute to the success of a great company that, in turn, brings value to clients across the world and supports the global economy.
CREW ENGAGEMENT SURVEY RESULTS
In 2019, for the third time, MSC Shipmanagement conducted its biennial Seafarer’s Engagement Survey. All seagoing MSC staff on cargo ships were invited to provide feedback across 10 Key Areas. The scale and breadth of the survey highlights the commitment of MSC Shipmanagement to seeking staff opinion on matters relating to operational excellence, sustainable growth and progressive policy formulation. Care for people
CREW ENGAGEMENT SURVEY: KEY AREAS
is one of the core values of MSC and the Seafarer’s Engagement Survey is one important way in which Management can gauge the needs and sentiments of its seafaring employees.
Although the main structure of the survey remained the same as in previous years to allow us to compare trends, the 2019 edition saw the addition of some new questions and areas in order to measure some changing opera- tional parameters. The response rate in 2019 was high (76%), up from 67% in the 2017 survey. 6,944 responses were received across all ranks and nationalities and from both active crew and those on leave. Overall, crew satis- faction across all the Key Areas was very high, scoring an average Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 6.31 out of 7. NPS is a metric that is widely used in business to evalu- ate client or employee satisfaction. The three highest NPS scores were found in the areas of (i) Sustainability, (ii) Commitment and (iii) Company values, all of which recorded scores of more than 6.4 out of 7. In addition to the scores recorded, written comments provided by respondents provided further insights into the views of seafarers.
CREATING A HEALTHY LIFE ON BOARD
     A working life at sea has many challenges. MSC Shipmanagement is very aware of this, so has estab- lished a dedicated team to run programmes that embed the strong MSC company culture that is focused on safety, performance and skills development, with an emphasis on empowering its people.
ENABLING A POSITIVE AND OPEN WORK CULTURE
MSC Shipmanagement strengthens the motivation and engagement of seafarers by working to build a positive
75 www.msc.com/swe/careers/our-values
working environment. This begins with creating regular and open communication channels between team members and their superiors. In this way, in keeping with the MSC Value ‘Continuous Evolution’75, feedback can be gathered, needs expressed, ambitions shared, misunderstandings avoided and conflict mitigated.
A productive workplace is also one where effort and talent is recognised and rewarded. MSC has a well-es- tablished programme of training and professional development opportunities, described on pages 101-105. Furthermore, as a large, growing company, MSC offers possibilities for career progression. And while job

Installation of more crew-friendly facilities likely led to an increase in the score for internet availability. Results show an improvement in onboard food quality too, which follows improvements already recorded in 2017 relative to 2015. Across the eight areas relating to quality of life on board, all have improved since 2017. The main area for further management attention is the quality of protective clothing.
ORGANISATIONAL EXCELLENCE
In the Seafarer Survey there are eight measures for Organisational Excellence. In previous years, MSC already scored highly in these areas, so the 2019 survey did not record substantial changes. Yet, when overall satisfaction levels are already high, even small increments are signif- icant. For example, timely remittance of wages received the highest rating across all survey questions, scoring 6.8/7, an uptick of 0.02 since the 2017 survey.
SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE –
SEAFARER PERSPECTIVE
Sustainability has always been a priority for MSC Shipmanagement, and survey results show that seafar- ers are also concerned about environmental protection. The results also suggest that our emphasis on sustain- ability is well understood by seafarers, and that MSC is making progress on raising awareness of these issues. Like the results from 2017, the 2019 survey results indicate that our seafarers feel proud that MSC puts effort into fuel efficiency initiatives to make a positive environmental impact. Sustainability was the best-rated area in the survey, with no questions registering scores under 6.51 on a 7-point scale.
Y VALUES all of wich recorded scores of more than 6.4 out of 7 intended to sail with MSC for the full duration of their
careers. Other indicators of seafarer satisfaction were evident in responses to questions in the new Key Area ‘Attractiveness of MSC Compared to Others’. A very high rating of 6.33 was recorded. Furthermore, when asked if MSC had improved over the past two years, all seafar- ers gave a score of at least 6.35 out of 7.
LEADERSHIP AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT
In the area of leadership, the survey indicated that not only are MSC seafarers generally satisfied that their supervisors keep them well-informed, but they also felt that they could communicate freely with them. While the results on the ability to motivate and inspire junior staff improved since 2017, the survey pointed to this as an area for further improvements in the coming years. It is of utmost importance to MSC Shipmanagement that seafarers feel their professional development and working conditions are being prioritised. Survey results show that this is the case. Seafarers who rated this as an important theme for them feel there are good opportu- nities for personal growth and development with MSC: the survey reported a score of 6.25/7 for this issue. The satisfaction level with promotions at MSC improved since 2017 and MSC Shipmanagement will continue to address this to ensure ever-higher levels of satisfaction for seafarers in this area.

SUPPORT FOR SEAFARERS AND THEIR FAMILIES
MSC Shipmanagement Crewing Department under- takes a wide range of tasks to ensure the wellbeing of our seafarers. There are many important administra- tive aspects of the work, but it is the human dimension that makes the MSC core values of ‘People’ and ‘Family’ stand out. MSC recognises that for crew members who spend months at sea, knowing their families are cared for brings comfort, and allows them to focus on the requirements of their roles. The MSC ethic is clear; seafarers’ family members are also part of the MSC family.
While employment agreements define the duration of the period at sea, at times urgent requests are received for disembarkation, due to, for example, death or illness of family members, or other personal requests of importance to the seafarers. In such situations the MSC Crewing Office reviews the request and puts in
motion the arrangements to relieve the crew member. MSC goes to considerable lengths, administratively and financially, to plan logistics, and where necessary, liaise with government officials, and oversee the bureaucrat- ic aspects of swift, unplanned repatriation. In addition, MSC Shipmanagement is very aware that when working on the high seas, contact with family and friends can be a lifeline. The Company has installed internet across its fleet to enable crew members to contact their families as needed.
Once they have successfully completed a contract onboard an MSC vessel, all MSC seafarers are insured by a Medical Plan which extends to their vacation periods. Medical plan by Marine Benefits offers client service, claims handling and member support, around the clock, 365 days a year. Furthermore, prompt payment of wages has always been a priority for MSC, and even in times of global economic downturn, MSC protects staff salaries by first seeking cost saving measures elsewhere.
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
MSC Shipmanagement has been investing in the capac- ity building of its team both on board the ships and ashore since its inception. We consider that creating a culture of learning and leadership is part of growing our organisation and empowering our people. It is part of value creation, which itself extends beyond finan- cial measures of performance to include intangible, but nonetheless invaluable, aspects of our success, such as relationships, trust, experience and reputation.
EXCELLENCE THROUGH LEADERSHIP
Creating the conditions for excellence in safety requires skills in communication, influencing others and leading by example. MSC Shipmanagement, headquartered in Limassol, Cyprus, and in Sorrento, Italy, have been running a leadership development course since 2011. 2019 saw the transformation of the course with the addition of new content. The new Excellence in Leadership course was launched in 2019 and 250 officers have already participated. It explores leadership characteristics and examines what makes a great leader and how leadership style can be applied in different situations. MSC Shipmanagement values strong and successful leaders and depends on them to manage the various challenging scenarios that life at sea can present.
A key message of the course is the need for leader- ship by example, because of the trust and respect that this engenders amongst peers. The ‘Excellence through Leadership’ programme aims to achieve the following fundamental outcomes:
• Create leaders of the future
• Improve management and leadership capabilities
within the business
• Identify and develop talent for management
positions
• Enable high-performing teams
• Energise and engage employees
DEVELOPING SKILLSETS FOR SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
A knowledgeable and well-trained workforce is not just part of responsible business operations, it is also an investment in the future. Shipping is a highly regulat- ed and technical sector, which requires advanced levels of expertise upon which the safety of the crew, security of the cargo and, ultimately, the performance of MSC depend. One specific skillset that is rapidly evolving, owing primarily to emerging regulations and advances in technology, is environmental protection, and specif- ically, the use of machinery and technology for this. Autonomous ships may be a reality in the future, yet at MSC we believe that human capital is an invaluable asset, and thus remain focused on training our staff both onboard and onshore in this important area.
PRIORITISING IT KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS
Despite the growing need for staff with IT skills, there are no official standards or certifications required by the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). To fill this gap, MSC Shipmanagement has put in place regular training to improve the IT skills of its officers on board by focused tutorials, webinars or seminars with service providers. For example, in collaboration with a leading maritime training institution in India, as part of the crew onboarding programme, MSC Shipmanagement has established a training programme for all ranks on board. Currently offered to cadets, it focuses on maintaining relevant and current IT knowl- edge and skills as well as instilling a digital mindset amongst our crew. This is very important for building both the confidence and competence to use technology to its full potential. The programme will soon be extend- ed to other crew training centres.

NAVIGATIONAL SIMULATOR TRAINING
At MSC, we have been early adopters of simulator train- ing to provide lifelike practical preparation for operational scenarios and incident avoidance. For example, the use of technology to simulate real-time navigation, berthing and unberthing of our ships helps to make navigation safer. Navigational incidents pose a risk to the environment for a variety of reasons: containers can fall overboard; fuel tanks may be damaged; other vessels may be damaged, which may also contribute to pollution. The MSC simula- tor training has undergone major changes since it started over 15 years ago. It is now conducted across all ranks of officers and deck ratings, and real incidents are simulated based on possible environmental factors such as wind, swell, sea and visibility conditions.
ELECTRONIC CHARTS FOR NAVIGATION AND PASSAGE PLANNING
MSC Shipmanagement started installing the ECDIS (Electronic Charts Display Information System) on board its vessels in 2012, well before subsequent regula- tion came into force. We also started training our deck officers, including Masters, on ECDIS use, so when it became mandatory in 2018, there was already a good level of familiarity with ECDIS operation amongst MSC officers. Lack of familiarisation with ECDIS has contrib- uted to serious navigational incidents in the shipping
industry. MSC prepares officers for future e-navigation76 and for compliance with our strict harbour manoeuvring plan (HMP) requirements. HMPs were first developed and used by MSC in 2012 to further enhance naviga- tional safety. These plans are followed by a vessel’s bridge team and by harbour pilots, and have contribut- ed significantly to smooth navigation through harbours. MSC Shipmanagement was an important partner in the EU-funded Sea Traffic Management Validation Project77, in which over 90 Company-managed vessels participat- ed between 2015 and 2018.
In 2019, MSC introduced new online training for passage
planning on ECDIS for Masters and Navigating Officers.
SAFE USE OF BALLAST WATER
TREATMENT SYSTEMS
MSC complies with the requirements of The International
emissions reduction technology. MSC opted to install hybrid exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS) on many vessels in its fleet because of their greater reliability and safety from the perspective of the crew.
The proper and reliable operation of EGCS depends on the training of both crew and shore-side personnel, as well as support from a dedicated Shipmanagement maintenance team. Each crew member involved in the operation is provided with specific training and a digital manual with troubleshooting tips and real-time scenarios to deal with operational issues.
CLOUD-BASED SOFTWARE FOR CARGO PLANNING
Until recently, MSC used a variety of software for loading cargo onto different ships. In 2019, the decision was taken to implement a uniform cloud-based cargo planning system across whole MSC fleet. This measure was to achieve consistency, to provide standardised vessel-load- ing information to all stakeholders and to ensure that possible safety risks such as overloading, high stresses and excessive lashing force are addressed.
The course aims to provide the required knowledge, skill
Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM Convention). These regulations entered into force in September 2017 and aim to protect the marine environment from the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms in ballast water carried by
GRAPHIC H ships. The Company has retrofitted ballast water treat- ment systems on more than 250 vessels (approximately 50% of the fleet). In addition, all vessels delivered since 2012 have this technology already. Crew training on these systems is carried out on a regular basis in the
following ways.
EMISSIONS REDUCTION CONTROL:
EXHAUST GAS CLEANING SYSTEMS
Meeting the requirements of IMO 2020 in full and on time for the 1st January 2020 deadline required not only substantial investment in equipment and retrofits (see page 62), but also in the training of crew on the use of
GRAPHIC H
and understanding of passage planning to ensure the safe
navigation of vessels whose primary means of navigation is ECDIS. The course emphasises specific requirements for passage planning, calculating of safety limits and the usage and update of available data layers. It is an impor- tant step in achieving MSC’s fundamental objective of zero navigational incidents.
The environmental technology on board MSC ships requires specific, technical user knowledge to ensure its safe and reliable operation. The following sections provide examples of the measures taken by MSC to ensure crew members are trained on the purpose and function of such equipment.

CREATING CAREERS AND OPPORTUNITIES
MSC Shipmanagement recruits approximately 500 cadets from various countries, mainly India, Ukraine and Russia, and actively promotes shipping as a career avenue in other countries such as Cyprus, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Some cadets are recruited from these regions too. Our support ranges from investing in independent maritime training institutes by means of equipment for training, to contributing to the development of training programmes relevant for the future growth of maritime profession- als. MSC supports these institutes by making subject matter experts available, delivering lectures on key topics, providing regular interaction with sponsored cadets, invit- ing them on board our ships for practical experience, and later supporting them with further education and certification. The success of this investment in cadet train- ing is evident in the Masters and Chief Engineers now
employed by MSC, as well as the recruitment of onshore staff across various MSC offices as Superintendents or Planners, Port Captains in crewing offices, and in management positions in global MSC offices. This form of capacity building also creates competencies that will be of value outside the Company, with a positive ancil- lary impact on local economies too.
MSC TRAINING ACADEMY, INDIA
MSC has been associated with the International Maritime Institute78(IMI), the leading maritime institute in India, for over two decades. MSC Shipmanagement has been consistently investing in and supporting the training of cadets and taking care of their welfare. In recent years MSC has further strengthened this relation- ship by setting up the MSC Training Academy, a joint venture with IMI to train crew for their cruise line vessels, thereby furthering maritime careers and creat- ing opportunities for future generations.
A LONG-TERM COLLABORATION WITH NATIONAL UNIVERSITY ODESSA MARITIME ACADEMY, UKRAINE
National University Odessa Maritime Academy79(OMA) was founded in 1944 as the Odessa Higher Engineering Marine School. In 2016 it was renamed the National University Odessa Maritime Academy. Over the years the University has trained over 40,000 professionals from 45 countries.
Odessa Maritime Academy has been a well-known and respected institution in the world maritime community for decades, and in January 2019 celebrated its 75th anniversary. Its main objective is to satisfy the growing educational and cultural needs of Ukrainian citizens and foreign nationals in obtaining higher maritime educa- tion which ensures employment opportunities, a good salary, lifelong career development perspectives and competitiveness in the world labour market.
Students and cadets at the academy number in the region of 10,000, with thousands of additional seafarers undertaking refresher courses at the Academy each year. The Academy offers a modern theoretical and techni- cal education, as well as advanced maritime simulators. MSC Shipmanagement (Cyprus) has been supporting and collaborating with the Academy for more than 10 years, in partnership with the MSC Crewing Services LLC, based in Ukraine. In recent years, new equipment, laboratories and simulators have been installed. MSC Shipmanagement (Cyprus) sponsored the deployment of new navigational equipment for training, including gyro compasses, magnetic compasses, an echo sounder, a GPS receiver with a display, an antenna and match- ing power supply.
ADOPT-A-SHIP PROGRAMME
The Cyprus Shipping Chamber (CSC) and the Cyprus Marine Environment Protection Association (CYMEPA) have developed a voluntary ‘Adopt-a-Ship’ Programme. The Programme has a dual purpose; firstly, to encourage children aged 10 to 12 years old to consider a career in shipping, and secondly, to promote shipping as a safe, efficient and modern mode of transport.
The details of the operations and processes in the shipping industry are not widely understood. Articles in the media at times present a negative image of the sector. Whilst the Adopt-a-Ship Programme cannot change the wider public perception of shipping, it aims to help the children participating in the scheme to better understand, for example, what a ship does, where it travels, the cargoes it carries, etc. The programme runs for the entire school year and typically requires a weekly email exchange between the school and the ship to which it is assigned. The school children have a maritime map in their classroom showing where the ship is, the latest email posted, details of ports of call, cargoes carried, etc. In addition to a weekly message, the ship may send photos, old charts and accounts of the crew’s activities onboard. The Masters of the vessels share pictures, challenges and adventures at sea, which help to inform and inspire the students.
The Adopt-a-Ship programme was first introduced on 12 MSC vessels in 2016 and has proven hugely popular with schools and students alike. Since then, the number of participating ships has increased to over 20 and over 25 children from local schools have visited our MSC Shipmanagement premises. The Programme is set to continue its educational mission, and its objective to highlight the contribution of shipping to the local community and economy in Cyprus, as well as the central role of shipping in global trade.

 BUSINESS ETHICS AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
         106 BUSINESS ETHICS AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
MSC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 107

HUMAN RIGHTS DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES
In recent years, human rights considerations, in accord-
ance with the latest and expected developments at the
Procurement and Finance Departments.
Our main current practices and processes related to human rights and the steps we have taken to mitigate the risk of Modern Slavery and human trafficking in our business activities and supply chain are reported and published every year on our official website: www.msc. com/modern-slavery-statement.
According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) “it is increas- ingly recognised that human rights are essential to achieve sustainable development.80 The Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development “seek to realise the human rights of all and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls”81. As reported by the Danish Institute for Human Rights, “more that 90% of the goals and targets are grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments82.”
In line with this approach, MSC believes that the respect for human rights begins with the respect for its employ- ees and other key stakeholders who might be impacted by its business activities and operations. MSC’s Human Rights Due Diligence Processes therefore focus on leveraging existing compliance infrastructure within the organisation to maximise the creation of long-term sustainable value while preventing adverse impacts on people and communities.
MSC’s broader sustainability approach reinforces the message that all SDGs are equally important and inter- related, as all MSC’s Sustainability Pillars have the same strategic importance. For us, this is crucial not only to prevent legal, financial, commercial or reputational risks, including those related to human rights, but also to ensure business continuity and preserve our natural resources for current generations and others to come. As an illustration, MSC’s commitment to the progressive realisation of the UN SDG 8 (Decent work and Economic growth) is strongly linked to all others, including the environmental goals such as the SDGs 14 (Life below water) and 15 (Life on land). If all employees, includ- ing seafarers, have decent working conditions and their rights are guaranteed, they will be committed to their
work and, as a result, this will significantly reduce the risk of accidents and incidents on land and at seas. They will also help promote responsible practices wherever we operate.
Furthermore, MSC believes that sustainable development can only be achieved by promoting non-discriminatory management processes allowing employees to have an enhanced and fulfilled human existence. In this respect, MSC offers and secures long-term employ- ment opportunities, supports participatory and inclusive access to quality professional development plans and promotes healthy and safe working environments. For us, this means helping people “to have the right tools to lift themselves out of poverty, combating the cycle of poverty as well as reducing the risk of transmitting poverty to the next generations. And this can only be progressively realised by empowering human beings, increasing their sense of ownership, and improving their access to their basic needs and to the enjoyment of their fundamental rights and freedoms”83.
ESTABLISHMENT OF A HUMAN RIGHTS FUNCTION
To better improve internal processes, promote policy development within the organisation and raise aware- ness of our complex human rights frameworks internally and externally, MSC introduced a cross-departmental Human Rights function based at the Headquarters. This supports key HQ Departments and MSC’s entities by further bringing a human rights lens to their respec- tive existing activities, processes and practices. The function provides policy guidance and supports MSC’s due diligences efforts, both internally and externally, in the areas of Business and Human Rights, Labour Standards and Modern Slavery.

INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES: OUR HUMAN RIGHTS ASSESSMENTS
MSC commends the ongoing efforts put forward by the international community in the area of Business and Human Rights. We particularly appreciate the steps taken to encourage policy coherence in government action84 and related discussions advancing corporate human rights regulatory frameworks at the regional and/or global level. Despite the increasing number of international guidelines and tools providing guidance on how to implement the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), we still face a fragmentation at the domestic level in the enforcement of corporate requirements related to the protection of human rights. Furthermore, operational best practices and related recommendations seeking to clarify governance gaps, risk assessments and human rights considerations, are, at this stage, mainly tailored to businesses dealing with the production/sourc- ing of commodities (“upstream sectors”) or to those processing commodities, products, software, technol- ogy or other materials into final products for end-users (“downstream sectors”).
In contrast to the above-mentioned sectors, MSC is a service provider dealing with transportation and, whenever relevant, the storage of commodities (“midstream sector”), operating worldwide in one of the most regulated industries at the global level. Therefore, MSC’s responsible business practices adhere to and draw upon internationally recognised human rights and labour principles and standards.
In this respect, we developed our due diligence processes against the existing complex regulato- ry frameworks, including our sector-specific human rights regulatory framework, which we already comply
with and implement. We focus on identifying areas of improvement in alignment with developments at the international level and in domestic legislations, and on working collaboratively with our peers and other stakeholders to meet our industry’s shared challenges, whenever relevant. Our policies, processes and proce- dures consider the following: ad hoc interpretations of human rights potential risks and impacts; interactions with concerned/relevant stakeholders and right-hold- ers to prevent human rights abuses; compliance with a wide range of international standards and requirements defined by maritime and labour conventions adopted at the international level by the United Nations. These include, but are not limited to, working conditions, human development and training at the workplace set forth by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for our sector and local health and safety requirements at the ports of call or repair facilities.
Additionally, MSC has management systems assess- ing, preventing and mitigating potential environmental, human rights and broader social risks in project finance. Whenever applicable, MSC complies with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability, which “have become globally recognised good practice in dealing with environmental and social risk management.”85
More information on due diligence processes and social and environmental risk impact assessments and management systems can be found in the “Social Inclusion” chapter of our 2018 Sustainability Report (pages 16-45).
HUMAN RIGHTS OF SEAFARERS
At the international level, seafarers are considered as a category of workers needing specific and comprehen- sive protection due to their type of work. In this respect, to ensure decent living and working conditions on board ships, in 2006 the International Labour Organization (ILO) adopted the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (MLC, 2006), widely known as the “Seafarers Bill of Rights”.
MSC meets and/or exceeds the requirements of the MLC, 2006 and strictly complies with the terms and condi- tions of the applicable collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the International Transport Federation (ITF) on behalf of seafarers. The MSC Shipmanagement Crew Welfare Department monitors the effective imple- mentation of international standards on board ships through:
• periodical audits on board ships
• individual interviews with crew members
to understand their concerns/feedback
• follow-up and implementation of any gaps or areas
of improvement as noted during audit/onboard inspection/third-party inspections
The Department works closely with MSC Shipmanagement’s Technical, Safety and Quality, Crewing, and Learning and Development Team to ensure that all corrective actions and findings related to compliance with the MLC, 2006 are addressed as a matter of priority. The Team has also the responsibil- ity to proactively keep abreast of any amendments or developments in international regulations and to ask the relevant departments to review and implement policies or processes accordingly.
MSC allocates an operational budget for crew welfare on board its ships to guarantee that there are no finan- cial constraints in implementing ongoing and expected new regulations and requirements in this area. As an illustration, in accordance with the 2014 amendments to the MLC, 2006, which came into force in January 2017, MSC has financial security in place to comply with the following new regulations:
• Repatriation costs and other expenses for all essen- tial needs, including food, medical, accommodation and communication (as per MLC regulation 2.5)
to ensure that seafarer repatriation takes place effectively and that crew members are paid and repatriated in a timely manner;
• Ship owner’s liability (as per MLC regulation 4.2) to ensure that the seafarers are protected from financial consequences arising from sickness, injury, death or long-term disability in connection with their employment
Additionally, MSC Shipmanagement has already started to implement the 2018 amendment to the MLC, 2006 related to piracy and armed robbery since 2019, even though it has not yet come into force.
The financial security fund has been arranged with our P&I Clubs86 and a copy of the financial security certificate is available on board each vessel. It is also accessible to each crew member, and a copy is kept with the respec- tive flag administration of the vessels.
More information on how we promote the human rights of our seafarers can be found in the “Business Ethics and Protection of Human Rights” chapter of our 2018 Sustainability Report (pages 98-102).

Each Club is an independent, not-for-profit mutual insurance association, providing cover for its shipowner and charterer members against third-party liabilities arising out of the use and operation of ships; for more information: www.igpandi.org/about

MSC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 111

 INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR SEAFARERS
The Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 has two primary purposes:
• To bring the system of protection contained in exist-
ing labour standards closer to the workers concerned, in a form consistent with the rapidly developing, globalised sector (ensuring “decent work”)
• To improve the applicability of the system so that shipowners and governments interested in provid- ing decent conditions of work do not have to bear an unequal burden in ensuring protection (“level-playing field” - fair competition)
It is often called the “fourth pillar” of international maritime regulatory regime, because it will, when it enters into force, stand beside the key IMO Conventions (SOLAS, MARPOL and STCW87) that support quality shipping and help elimi- nate substandard shipping.
Source: www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/ documents/presentation/wcms_230030.pdf
It should be noted that the MLC, 2006 applies to all ships, whether publicly or privately owned, ordinarily engaged in commercial activities, other than ships engaged in fishing or in similar pursuits and ships of traditional build such as dhows and junks. This Convention does not apply to warships or naval auxiliaries. All merchant ships vessels over 500 GRT88, with the exception of those navigating exclusively in inland waters or in waters subject to port regulations, must carry the MLC certificate of compliance. For vessels under 500 GRT, international guidelines recom- mend the vessels to be voluntarily in compliance with the MLC, 2006 and as documented by the flag states.

EMPLOYEES AND THIRD PARTIES
In a globalised economy where workers and employers are based in different countries which may have different levels of enforcement of social protection and development, achieving equal decent work conditions throughout the whole value and supply chains is often challenging. Nevertheless, in addition to national applicable legisla- tion and requirements, MSC strives to promote responsible business conduct based on international standards. In this respect, MSC supports:
• the UN Global Compact Ten Principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption
• the respect of relevant principles as contained in the International Bill of Human Rights as well as the respect
of relevant provisions and recommendations of International Labour Organization (ILO) instruments and
Conventions
• the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible
Business Practices, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and related sector-specific guidance tools developed by the international community. As a Swiss company, MSC also supports the relevant recommendations as contained in “The Commodity Trading Sector: Guidance on Implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights”89, published by the government of Switzerland in 2018.

POLICY COMMITMENT TO FOSTER RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT (RBC)90
in performing their professional duties. Since 2017, MSC has adopted the MSC Conflicts of Interest Policy which provides guidelines on how to identify, report and manage actual and potential conflict of interest situations.
In order to adopt more efficient methods of reporting, by 2019 all employees were requested to disclose via an online platform any potential or actual conflict of inter- est, by completing and submitting the conflict of interest questionnaire on a dedicated web-based platform.
TACKLING CORRUPTION
The fight against corruption is at the core of MSC’s Compliance Programme. In support of this position, MSC has adopted policies and procedures that oblige all employees to comply with the letter and spirit of all applicable anti-corruption laws. Our internal Anti-Bribery Policy applies to all employees around the globe. MSC’s anti-corruption programme includes trainings and e-learnings focusing on anti-bribery.
Throughout 2019, MSC focused on developing anti- bribery measures by putting in place a Procedure for Gifts and Corporate Hospitality, applicable to its
employees worldwide. More precisely, MSC focused on a global assessment of appropriate thresholds regard- ing gifts and corporate hospitality within MSC Agencies worldwide and adopted policies on the subject. The policies take into account the fact that gifts and corpo- rate hospitality are part of establishing and maintaining a good business relationship, but state that they should be reasonable, proportionate, transparent and justifiable for the occasion. The threshold takes into considera- tion applicable laws, cost of living, minimum wage, etc. Any gift or corporate hospitality with a value exceed- ing the threshold set by MSC’s Procedure for Gifts and Corporate Hospitality, as implemented, is subject to the approval of MSC Geneva’s Corporate Legal Compliance Team. In relation to third parties, in 2019 MSC actively enhanced its efforts by contractually requesting identi- fied business partners (such as terminal operators and connecting carriers) to comply with applicable anti-brib- ery laws. In addition, MSC expects such business partners to perform their services in accordance with similar ethical principles to those set out in the Code. MSC also performs compliance screenings and due diligence on identified third parties.
As stated by the United Nations, “transport is the backbone of global trade and the global economy. The jobs and livelihoods of billions of people in the develop- ing world, and standards of living in the industrialised and developed world, depend on ships and shipping. The shipping industry has played an important part in the dramatic improvements in global living standards that have taken millions of people out of acute poverty in recent years91”.
As a world leader in international container shipping, MSC’s worldwide daily operations enable and support development and inclusive growth across five conti- nents. To ensure long-term benefits wherever we operate, we are strongly committed to conducting our business activities legally, responsibly and with integ- rity, and we expect the same from our affiliates and business partners. This commitment is endorsed by the top management and reflected in a number of policies, processes and practices implemented by relevant departments.
Considering MSC’s global operations and the interna- tional shipping sector’s complex regulatory framework, MSC’s compliance with its legal obligations is a daily task that requires continuous monitoring of applicable laws and regulations. To meet this challenge, MSC has created a compliance programme in accordance with the ethical standards of responsible business conduct, as set forth in the MSC Code of Business Conduct (the “Code”) and in line with the MSC Values.
Throughout 2019, MSC continued monitoring the imple- mentation of the Code within MSC’s Agencies, in close collaboration with the local Code Implementers. A network of approximately 160 local Code Implementers
is actively ensuring that the Code complies with local applicable requirements. To ensure a correct under- standing and the widest dissemination of the Code’s principles and standards, employees have access to the Code in 20 different languages.
Furthermore, MSC continuously focuses on employee capacity-building and professional development. We therefore provide regular training sessions on specific modules of the Code to MSC employees and Agencies. Our objective is to raise awareness of legal require- ments that are relevant to each employee’s daily work. Such trainings are tailored to our industry with illus- trative examples and case studies. Since 2018, MSC Geneva’s Corporate Legal Compliance Team has deliv- ered mandatory trainings on the Code to newcomers to MSC as part of their onboarding programme at MSC’s Headquarters. The MSC Shipmanagement team deliv- ers similar training to all of its shore-based employees and crew members, including master and senior officers employed onboard its managed vessels.
In the spirit of constant development of its compliance programme and adherence to international stand- ards, including the United Nations Global Compact Ten Principles in the areas of anti-corruption, human rights, labour and the environment, MSC launched a review process of all sections and topics of the Code, in collaboration with relevant in-house subject matter experts. The revised version of the Code was published in 2020, while we were writing this report.
Another part of MSC’s Compliance Programme is preventing employees from being involved in any activity that would conflict or alter their judgement

In order to confront the challenges of anti-corruption within the shipping industry, since October 2017, MSC has been a member of the MACN Maritime Anti-Corruption Network. MSC Geneva’s Corporate Legal Compliance Team, in col- laboration with MSC Shipmanagement, engages with ex- ternal stakeholders and participates in discussions, collab- orates and exchanges views with other shipping lines to share best practices and develop strategies to tackle cor- ruption in the maritime sector and more specifically in the container shipping industry. MSC is part of the Container Working Group within the MACN which represents around 65% of the container carrier market. In 2019, MACN’s collective actions have generated major outcomes such
as the reduction in demands for facilitation payments during operations at Nhava Sheva Port in India. MSC joined the “MACN Port Integrity Campaign in India” which tackles corrupt practices at Nhava Sheva Port. Key activities of the campaign include the implemen- tation of integrity training for port officials and the es- tablishment of clear escalation and reporting process.
To foster integrity, MSC continuously focuses on embed- ding the anti-bribery culture among vessel masters and crew members. Throughout 2019, over 770 senior officers, including MSC Shipmanagement Masters, have been trained in anti-bribery matters.

NAVIGATING A COMPLEX GLOBAL SANCTIONS LANDSCAPE
MSC is fully committed to ensuring that all its activities and operations are in line with applicable sanctions regula- tions when conducting business anywhere in the world. Compliance with Swiss and European Union sanctions regulations is at the core of MSC’s business model. Therefore, all our employees and MSC Agencies perform- ing shipping-related services on our behalf have to comply with them.
With this in mind, MSC developed and implemented a sanctions compliance programme consisting of a set of procedures to ensure compliance with such sanctions regulations.
MSC has a dedicated team dealing with compliance with sanctions regulations and a network of compliance officers in each MSC Agency implementing our procedures. MSC provides its employees with compliance training through webinar or live sessions to its employees. Such trainings are tailor-made and adapted to the shipping industry.
SPEAKING UP: A CORNERSTONE OF MSC’S COMPLIANCE PROGRAMME
Establishing a culture of speaking up is a continuous objective for MSC. In that respect, confidential means of reporting such as the “MSC Speak Up Line” are at employees’ disposal to raise their concerns. This tool is an online platform developed by a third-party service provider, complementing MSC’s existing reporting procedures.
Throughout 2019, as required by MSC’s Values, the MSC Speak Up Line led to an open and accountable workplace. Our employees worldwide were strongly encouraged to report any misconduct or violation of laws without fear of retaliation. This mechanism is adapted to applicable laws and requirements. All reports received were carefully and confidentially evaluated on a case-by-case basis by experts in the relevant subject matter. Depending on the report, internal investigations may be initiated, and an action plan is adopted where deemed necessary.
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
KEEP INVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE
MSC’s people are at the heart of our business and proac- tively contribute to our long-standing success. They are our key asset and one of our main competitive advantag- es. Just as our services cover all continents, spanning land, sea and inland waterways, our employees come from the four corners of the globe, bringing a wealth of local knowledge and richness that support the growth of MSC’s brand in a manner that makes us stand out from the rest. Indeed, they embody our corporate culture and meaningful core values, transmitting to our millions of customers our passion for shipping, commitment to responsible business practices and our heightened sense of service.
Since 1970, MSC has seen exponential growth in terms of volume, fleet capacity and global number of employ- ees, while diversifying its activities and services. Despite the extremely competitive business environment and the wide range of economic, social and geopolitical challenges our industry has faced, we have navigat- ed each decade with versatility, business agility and a resourcefulness that still keep us at the top of our indus- try. We are strong because we come together, and we never stopped investing in our human resources capac- ity and the continuous development of our employees. As our business continues to expand, in recent years, our People Development Team, within the Human Resources Department based at the Headquarters, has further increased its range of e-learning and courses on technical, soft skills, and health and well-being. We are also multiplying our efforts to embed MSC’s Values throughout our growing value chain and to enhance our support for employees and managers in further develop- ing the core competencies that define our own unique corporate identity.
Additionally, our Global Human Resources Department continues to work closely with MSC’s network of Agencies worldwide, providing courses and relat- ed educational material, adapted to the various local contexts and regional and/or country-specific thematic areas. In line with this approach, the Department has
also strengthened its collaboration with local human resources officers, continuously striving to ensure that processes and procedures respect relevant domestic requirements and legislations while promoting social and cultural awareness and sensitivity.
PROMOTING EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND NON-DISCRIMINATION PRACTICES
Since the beginning, MSC has focused on promoting an inclusive, diverse and multi-cultural working environ- ment through the recruitment of local employees in each country of operation, without discrimination. Today, MSC prides itself on having a global workforce that consists of 157 nationalities and spans four generations, from baby boomers to Generation Z. With a view to maintaining and reinforcing our richness of representa- tion, we keep adapting our recruitment processes and procedures to further attract and retain young talent coming from different social, educational and econom- ic backgrounds.
MSC works across boundaries, geography and cultures. Consequently, it is important for us that people are able to work together in a respectful environment where their voices and ideas are heard, and that they are given the opportunity to be included in decision-making process- es at all levels. We believe that a working environment where fruitful cognitive exchanges and diversity are promoted drives changes and increases motivation, employee engagement, and productivity.
In order to achieve this, we work to maximise the performance of each individual and actively encourage teams to work collaboratively toward ambitious goals. Bullying and discrimination based on any grounds are forbidden, in line with our Code of Business Conduct. There are rules in place ensuring that decisions affect- ing employment, performance, training, promotion and career development are based on an individual’s capability and potential to grow. Additionally, we strive to prevent any passive acceptance of an environment in which discrimination or working-related abuses may occur by constantly promoting open communication via

REDUCING THE GENDER GAP
In line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goal 5, MSC believes that “gender equality is a fundamental and inviolable human right and women’s and girls’ empowerment is essential to expand economic growth, promote social development and enhance business performance.”92 Despite significant advancements in reducing barriers to improve gender balance and eradicate gender stere- otypes, attracting female talents to work in the maritime sector, and in particular on cargo ships, still remains a challenge. According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), only 2% of seafarers are women and 94% of female seafarers work in the cruise industry.93 Being part of the international shipping sector, MSC acknowledges that a number of factors may prevent women from being interested in pursuing a career at sea. Nevertheless, we have been strongly promot- ing on-shore employment opportunities for women, encouraging their progressive integration into maritime activities. This is now possible as the industry has evolved tremendously during the past decades, becom- ing more sophisticated and therefore requiring an increase in new functions and departments both at the Headquarters and local levels. We are therefore also focusing on empowering women through extensive investment in capacity-building efforts. Our aim is to provide further support in developing the technical skills and competences that our complex sector demands. In addition to specific technical courses, we also encour- age people in managerial positions to share with their respective teams - and especially with younger gener- ations of female employees - their knowledge, best practices and lessons learnt from years or decades of experience in the sector.
The number of women employed within our organisa- tion may still appear to be very low. This is because the data is combined with positions and senior managerial roles requiring an extensive nautical knowledge. These roles are therefore mainly occupied by men who have previously worked onboard cargo ships. However, it is important to report that we have almost reached a gender balance in other critical departments. Furthermore, MSC Shipmanagement Cyprus is currently working with some leading maritime training institutes in its crew sourcing countries. The project focuses on sponsoring the recruitment of a number of female cadets for working on cargo ships’ deck and engine depart- ments. Cargo ship crews are mostly male dominated and, over the years, MSC Shipmanagement has creat- ed a mindset among its crew members where the working environment is based on trust, mutual respect and accountability, in line with its internal policies. Based on recent assessments, MSC Shipmanagement believes that now is the appropriate time to increase the number of females working on board cargo vessels. MSC Shipmanagement will not only be involved in the selection of the sponsored female cadets, but will also follow their progress throughout their career in order to support the female cadets to become successful at sea.

 LOOKING AHEAD: THE FUTURE IS NOW
As stated by the Secretary General of the IMO on World Maritime Day 201994, “empowering women is not just an idea or a concept. It is a necessity that requires strong, positive action to address structural, institu- tional and cultural barriers. Shipping has always been a male-dominated industry and the same applies to many of the associated jobs and professions in the maritime community.”
In line with the IMO’s approach, in the coming year, MSC Geneva will be implementing a three-year Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan which will also focus on educa- tion, awareness and behavioural shift. In particular, we will develop and launch a “Mental Bias” e-learning as well as a “Diversity and Inclusion” e-learning. In order to promote diversity inclusion and gender considerations
across our value chain, MSC will also establish a Diversity and Inclusion Committee of executives representing company departments. This will help to increase account- ability at all levels across the organisation.
These initiatives will follow the launch of our Diversity and Inclusion Policy. In line with our values and in particu- lar with the value “Equal Opportunity”, our Code of Conduct, as well as our commitment to the progressive realisation of Sustainable Development Goal 5, the Policy aims to further support our continuous efforts to be a truly inclusive company, in which individual employees can demonstrate their potential to the fullest and through different approaches. For us, this means further embrac- ing and valuing diversity of perspective, thus building a flexible organisation where each and every employee is treated with respect and dignity, without discrimination.
 DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION ACTION PLAN: MAIN EXPECTED OUTCOMES
• Improved sense of belonging to our corporate culture and MSC’s Values
• Increased understanding among employees on how to operationalise MSC’s Values in their day-to-day work
and relationships at all levels
• Enhanced employee motivation and well-being thus improving productivity, performance and innovation
• Long-term career path in safe and healthy working conditions, especially in developing countries
• Improved recruitment practices ensuring the creation of larger talent pools, including with high levels of
cognitive diversity
• Improved employee retention rates, especially in developing countries
• Increased representation of women in the workforce
• Increased representation of women in leadership roles
• Foster the MSC brand as an employer of choice

  CASE STUDY
TiL: PROMOTING GENDER EQUALITY IN LKAB KLAIPEDOS SMELTE
LKAB “Klaipedos Smelte” is a modern container terminal located in Lithuania, on the Eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. Since 2008, it has been fully owned by Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), MSC’s port container terminal investor and operator. Currently the terminal plays the role of a strategic regional gateway to the emerging and growing markets of Lithuania and Belarus, among some other neighbouring countries. In 2019, 253,000 TEU were handled by the Terminal. In addition to general container handling and transshipment operations, the terminal supports MSC and its customers by offering competitive services such as Project Cargo handling as well as access to empty container depot, cold storage, a Container Freight Station95.
LKAB “Klaipedos Smelte” offers equal employment opportunities to all its employees and has proactively support- ed the recruitment of women since the beginning of its operations. Nevertheless, as other port companies, the terminal is still male-dominated and faces challenges in attracting female workers due to the specific types of work involved, which are traditionally carried out by men.

is key to removing social and cultural barriers that may prevent the creation of a more inclusive working environ- ment. In this respect, the Company has developed and implemented a number of policies and measures to help ensure that all employees have equal conditions for work, equal pay and the same6c4ar%ee6r4op%portunities, in accord- ance with applicable domestic laws, regulations and requirements.

As an illustration, the Terminal’s Equal Opportunity Policy guarantees equal status to all the employees or applicants, in all aspects of employment as well as in all aspects of the employment processes, strictly prohibit- ing discrimination based on any grounds. Additionally, the Policy provides a set of measures aimed at further promoting equal rights for women and men in the workplace. These include, but are not limited to, opportunities for professional development, requal- ification and mandatory social benefits, including those related to childcare, maternity and paternity leave. All Company employees have equal possibilities to submit an application for childcare leave, regardless of their gender or age. The company also has procedures in place to protect women who have recently given birth and are breastfeeding, in accordance with domestic laws. These include part-time work upon request and/ or the opportunity to work remotely for at least one fifth of their total working time upon request.

CONTRIBUTION TO HUMANITARIAN RELIEF
JOINING HANDS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
SUPPORTING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES IN NEED WHERE WE OPERATE AND BEYOND
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) “the size and number of humanitarian emergencies across the world continues to grow, testing our capacity and abili- ty to respond effectively”97. Furthermore, the number of people affected by humanitarian crises has almost doubled between 2010 and 202098.
In addition to the rising number of disasters, the nature of the emergencies is changing as well, with severe weath- er and other natural disasters increasing in intensity due to climate change99. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), “climate change can drive mass migration; battles over natural resources can plunge countries into prolonged war; and a fragile environ- ment can increase the risk and severity of natural disasters.” It is widely recognised by the international community that natural disasters have a far-reaching impact on already vulnerable communities. They further widen inequality and poverty. People living in vulnerable communities are more impacted and tend to have less access to essential resources for preparedness, mitigation and relief.
MSC is deeply committed to providing emergency logis- tics services through its core shipping and logistics activities, contributing and supporting peace-building efforts, as well as facilitating timely access to relief goods in compliance with international regulations. In this respect, MSC’s global network enables us to provide effective assistance to humanitarian relief efforts and we strive to offer our assets, equipment and exper- tise to deliver containers filled with lifesaving supplies in different parts of the world. Moreover, we continue to maximise the effectiveness of our response opera- tions and deliver timely assistance through strategic partnerships both with local entities and international
humanitarian organisations. These include longstanding support for organisations such as the World Food Programme (WFP), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).
INTRODUCING THE MSC FOUNDATION
In addition to providing humanitarian assistance through its core business activities, MSC has been actively contrib- uting to addressing the needs of the most vulnerable communities for over a decade through a wide range of impactful environmental conservation and humanitarian programmes.
The MSC Group established the non-profit MSC Foundation to consolidate, leverage and expand its environmental conservation, marine protection, sustain- able development and humanitarian commitments worldwide. The Foundation was officially launched on 8th November 2019 on board the new MSC Cruises ship MSC Grandiosa. The relief efforts and charitable projects previ- ously carried out by MSC or MSC Agencies have now been incorporated into the MSC Foundation portfolio. Aligned with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the MSC Foundation works to protect and nurture the planet, help disaster-struck populations to recover, and support vulnerable communities around the world to realise their full potential. Areas of activities include the promotion of inclusive and equitable access to quality education for all and awareness-raising campaigns on sustainable devel- opment and the responsible use of natural resources. The MSC Foundation drives and supports interventions focused on the marine environment, social issues and healthcare through the facilitation of funds, relief aid and research. It also helps steer the MSC Group’s commit- ment and strategic approach to fostering sustainability and promoting responsible business practices that can have long-term positive impacts around the world.
The MSC Foundation works both independently, implementing initiatives of its own design, and in conjunction with trusted partners that have a strong innovative vision or track record for effective action, leveraging MSC Group engagement to connect communities, raise awareness and mobilise the financial support of millions of people. Its longstanding partners include UNICEF, the Andrea Bocelli Foundation, Marevivo and Mercy Ships.
 The Foundation’s programmes are concentrated in four key focus areas:
 Environmental education, school education and vocational education are key for the younger generations who are our future.
The Foundation supports the most vulnerable communities around the world to realise their full potential through education, sustainable development and lifesaving humanitarian programmes.
The Foundation shares the same passionate commitment to the environment as every entity in the MSC Group. This commitment is expressed through impactful projects around the world.
The Foundation aims to intervene promptly in disaster situations, securing and transporting emergency relief to crisis areas worldwide.

UNICEF: WORKING TOGETHER TO REDUCE MALNUTRITION, FACILITATE ACCESS TO EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN AND EMPOWER WOMEN
Mercy Ships is a global charity that uses hospital ships staffed by all-volunteer crews as the most efficient way to deliver free, world-class healthcare services to people in desperate need in some of the poorest countries in the world.
MSC has been supporting Mercy Ships since 2011 with a special focus on sub-Saharan Africa, bringing hope and healing to thousands of people without access to safe, modern healthcare and surgery. As part of this partnership, MSC provides free containers and utilises all its resources to support the organisation’s commit- ment to performing lifesaving operations in areas that are without easy access to healthcare facilities.

Mercy Ships reports that over 18 million people die due to lack of surgical care every year100. 25% of the world’s diseases are concentrated in the continent, yet there are less than 10 physicians per 100,000 people. MSC’s global transport and logistics network enables us to transport medical supplies and other resources even to remote locations. Thanks to this support, Mercy Ships has been able to perform 18,550 free, life-chang- ing surgeries since the partnership with MSC was launched in 2011. In addition, Mercy Ships provides training, capacity building and infrastructure renova- tions that leave a lasting impact after their ship sails. Throughout 2019, the partnership facilitated the increase in the level of healthcare in countries lacking access to proper facilities and expertise.

Since 2009, the MSC Group and UNICEF have partnered in life-changing projects to fight malaria in Africa, provide education for children living in the slums of Brazil and combat child malnutrition, saving over 112,000 young lives.
In 2019, The MSC Foundation committed to support one of UNICEF’s most innovative programmes world- wide: the ‘Plastic Waste to Classrooms’ programme in Côte d’Ivoire which combines environmental action with women’s empowerment and increasing access to education.
At present, only 5% of plastic waste is recycled in Côte d’Ivoire, a country where 46% of households live below the poverty line and 1.6 million children are out of school because of poverty and a lack of classrooms101. The MSC Foundation’s new project with UNICEF address- es all three of these problem areas simultaneously by

  CASE STUDY
CYCLONE IDAI – REBUILDING DISASTER-STRICKEN COMMUNITIES
CASE STUDY
HURRICANE DORIAN – FROM HUMANITARIAN RELIEF TO RECOVERY
COUNTRY SITUATION
When the intense tropical cyclone Idai hit Mozambique in March 2019, several provinces were severely impacted, leaving an estimated 1.85 million people in need of humanitarian relief102. Cyclone Idai is regarded as one of the worst tropical cyclones on record to affect Africa and the Southern Hemisphere as a whole, causing catastrophic damage and a humanitarian crisis in Mozambique and neighbouring countries. In addition to lacking access to shelter and essential goods such as food, fresh water and medicine, people in the affected areas also suffered from a fast-spread- ing cholera outbreak103. One of the worst affected areas was Beira. The Port of Beira is the second largest port in Mozambique, acting as a strategic gateway not only to central Mozambique but also to the land-locked countries of Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi.
KEY ACTIONS
MSC, along with its logistics arm MEDLOG, supported the intergovernmental and international aid organisa- tions responding to the crisis by providing shipping and logistics services. This included the provision of containers and space on ships for food imports as part of the overall relief effort.
The MV Border was the first locally organised relief vessel to reach Beira, delivering 185 standard 20-foot containers packed with food, water, medicines and emergency relief aid cargo. Over 100 of these were provided by MSC. The company also collaborated with the World Food Programme (WFP) to transport 81 stand- ard containers of rice to Beira.
The MSC Capri was the first container vessel to berth in Beira after the cyclone, coming alongside just four days after the cyclone hit. The work done by the logis- tics community in Beira in the days immediately after the cyclone could support those who most needed it and helped to guarantee in the long run the wellbeing of numerous families, in Beira and the region, who rely on this logistics network for employment and more.
In the first 72 hours following the landfall of Idai in Beira, the city remained completely cut off from the country’s communication, transport, water and electric- ity networks. Operations in the port of Beira, including major rail and truck connections, were suspended for days. Customs and terminal operations resumed on 22nd March 2019. Two weeks after the cyclone hit, all MSC-operated infrastructure and hinterland connec- tions had been repaired and were operational, causing only minor delays in vessel operations.
MSC’s employees were among those badly affected by the tropical storm. MSC’s Beira office was severely damaged, and our container depot suffered a complete structural collapse. In addition, numerous MSC employees suffered significant damage to their homes. Forty MSC employees reported damage to roofs, windows, doors, walls, and severe water damage from the heavy rainfall, as well as damaged insulation. The company quickly responded and covered the rebuild- ing costs for all of the affected employees.
Hurricane Dorian ravaged the Bahamas in September 2019. Dozens were killed and thousands left homeless. Under a joint initiative with the MSC Foundation, MSC enlisted the help of scores of customers and partners to collect donated items that matched the aid require- ments identified by the Bahamian government. MSC was able to carry thousands of vital goods such as building materials, generators, tarpaulins, water, food, sanitary and medical supplies to local people in need.
A global taskforce was established to design and coordi- nate the efforts across the MSC Group of companies, working closely with local officials, community leaders and key relief and recovery organisations. The aim was to provide both immediate first responder relief and effective longer-term assistance with the rebuilding
efforts. In addition to having provided and delivered over 250 containers full of essential goods and making geared container ships available for the emergency relief cargo service from the US to the Freeport, Marsh Harbour and Abaco container terminals, the MSC Group’s efforts focused on providing semi-permanent prefabricated modular housing for people made homeless (delivered in 2020).
MSC has been present in the region for the past 20 years and it has long been the leading cargo import and export operator in the Bahamas. Its local Headquarters are based in Freeport, Grand Bahama. Working closely together, the MSC Foundation and MSC Group were able to take immediate, effective action, providing EUR 5.5 million of vital aid in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian.

A WORD FROM OUR PRESIDENT & CEO
Throughout 2018, MSC further increased its efforts to promote sustainable and ethical business practices within all entities of the Group, in line with its strategic approach to sustainability and the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption.
In addition to responding to the evolving and strict- er complex maritime regulatory framework we must comply with as an international shipping company, we continued adding layers to our existing internal methodologies and monitoring mechanisms in terms of governance, compliance, and risk management. Given the nature of our business activities and the growth of our diversified value and supply chains, we are making additional investments to ensure the effec- tive implementation of our processes on a global scale. These include the establishment of new functions, the optimisation of our supplier relationship management, and the reinforcement of a number of strategic teams responsible for supporting the broader transformation of MSC’s value chain.
Our ongoing organisation-wide coordination process led by headquarters and underpinned by our core MSC Group Values, includes an increase in our investments in personal development and training opportunities for all our employees. Additionally, we continue enhancing cross-departmental cooperation to ensure further improve- ments in embedding all dimensions of sustainability in our current practices, promoting a culture of integrity and encouraging a participatory approach in the decision-mak- ing processes at all levels within the business.
Our activities and operations all over the world require engagement with a wide range of stakeholders from most sectors and from both the public and private spheres. Therefore, in our 2018 Sustainability Report, we describe sustainability considerations from a variety of perspectives, including those of the asset management and investor community, by underlining the interrela- tion among all our strategic Sustainability Pillars and our continuous focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors. We also report on the way in which we continue to address our sector’s trends and global development challenges along with cross- cutting human rights principles and considerations in our investment models to ensure long-term benefits in local communities and to minimise our impact on the environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate how we implement fundamental responsibilities in the area of protection of human rights in line with internationally recognised human rights and labour principles and standards, in addition to domestic laws, requirements, and regulations of the countries in which we operate.
In terms of environmental performance, MSC embraces precautionary actions to mitigate or adapt to broad climate change global challenges and has substantially reduced CO2 emissions per ton of cargo moved. Our Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) analysis for 2018 indicates an improvement of 13% since 2015. In addition to this, MSC has obtained an EEOI certification by a globally recognised third-party auditing company. This attests to the accuracy and usability of the monthly EEOI figures calculated by the MSC Energy Efficiency team.
4 A WORD FROM OUR PRESIDENT & CEO

 Diego Aponte Group President & CEO, Capt. Gianluigi Aponte Group Chairman, Alexa Aponte Vago Group Chief Financial Officer
MSC is also investing heavily in low-carbon technologies and extensive new-build and retrofit programmes to boost performance and ensure its fleet is modern, fuel efficient, safe (for crew, environment, and cargo), and is prepared for the future. New vessels on order feature state-of-the-art engineering and design innovations to ensure optimal efficiency. We are also committed to full compliance with new environmental regulations such as IMO Sulphur 2020, which has very significant operational and financial implications for our sector. MSC has taken a proactive approach in this regard, leading the way on the installation of the best available and most flexible hybrid exhaust gas cleaning systems. This represents an investment of more than one billion US dollars. We see the regulation as a way that the whole sector can contribute to tackling air pollution and therefore support, among other initiatives, the progres- sive realisation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
While promoting dialogue and partnerships with our industry peers and other stakeholders, we believe that global progress on the SDGs should not follow a purely sector-specific approach. Indeed, nowadays, a majority of consumers expect an engagement from all companies regardless of the industry, for a responsible, socially, and environmentally friendly offer of products and services. Evolving trade scenarios, new geopolitical dynamics and challenging market environments require changes in collaboration patterns among all actors of global supply chains and the public sector. This is essen- tial to enable the business community to have an equal level playing field where competitive advantages can be maximised and enjoyed by all stakeholders. Ensuring business activities are truly sustainable and able to address current and future market imperatives, while maintaining strong financial performance that can effec- tively support inclusive development in the long term, is a responsibility that we all share.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT AND GOVERNANCE
METHODOLOGY
The MSC 2018 Sustainability Report highlights our active participation in the broad development process, in the context of the United Nations Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and Climate Change regulatory initiatives and measures. It also shows how we are continuously improving our existing business models and strategies to find innovative, systemic, and sustainable solutions with explicit measurable social and environmental impacts on the long term, along- side financial returns. In line with MSC’s commitment to transparency, our reports follow the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)1, the “Business Reporting on the SDGs: an anlysis of the Goals and Targets”, the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework along with a number of similar relevant tools developed by a number of stakeholders, including the International Organization for Standardization as well as the asset management and investors’ community. These tools have helped us formulate and develop our broader sustainability initiatives related to our four priority Sustainability Pillars: Social Inclusion, Occupational Health and Safety, Environment, Business Ethics and Protection of Human Rights.
SOCIAL INCLUSION ENVIRONMENT
In our sustainability approach, economic, social, and environmental performance as well as the linkages between development goals and targets (e.g. inclusive growth, social equity, and environmental protection) and key business goals (revenue growth, resource productivity, and risk management) are crucial. Furthermore, we mainstream UN Global Compact values and principles into our analysis of socio-economic trends and related considerations. This allows us to address all dimensions of sustainability, including peacebuilding and security matters, and to relate our impacts to cross-cutting and/ or associated SDGs targets.
In line with the above, in our Sustainability Reports, we strive to demonstrate how we have enhanced our multi-stakeholders’ holistic approach to foster development and how our long-term financial investment decisions and/or financing flows are in line with our sustainability strategy. In our decision- making process and analytical framework, we take into account both new and emerging challenges as well as global issues and evolving trends, including climate change challenges and geopolitical and macroeconomic incertitude and instability.

INTEGRATING THE SDGs IN OUR SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH: OUR PROCESS
MSC has conducted a global assessment to better analyse its contribution to sustainable development as well as the direct and/or indirect linkage of its operations to each SDGs. This resulted in the development of an organisation-wide shared vision promoting common areas of focus in existing practices and activities of each entity of the Cargo Division within the Group. In our sustainability approach, MSC’s four Sustainability Pillars are considered as our most salient material topics. Specific issues under each pillar are further
developed and leveraged whenever relevant to meet our stakeholders’ expectations and/or to reflect improvements in our internal processes and procedures. All our Sustainability Pillars are equally important, inter- related, and contribute to translating our core values and vision into concrete actions and initiatives designed to mitigate our impacts and bring long-term benefits to local communities wherever we operate.

  MSC SUPPORTS THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGs).
We believe our approach to the business and our values will help us contribute to a more sustainable supply chain.
                    OPERATIONALISING SDGs
In our report, we explain how we assess the potential impacts of our activities and ensure effective business continuity management plans to minimise, prevent, and avoid negative externalities, disruption of opera- tions as well as unnecessary risk to human health. As an illustration, we are continuously adapting our corporate practices, investments, activities, and opera- tions around the globe to a changing and unpredictable market while considering socio-economic changes and shifts that are influencing the shipping industries and transforming supply chains.
Our offer of new trade routes results in opportunities for serving new emerging markets, including more underserved markets located in emerging/developing countries. New services and transportation models developed ensure not only the effective delivery of products to distribution channels, but also have an impact on how ports, terminal operators, and truck operators are managed. Additionally, by investing on land infrastructure, such as depots, in strategic locations and being a freight rail operator, we actively support sustainable freight transport connectivity and the improvement of the whole logistics supply chain. Regulations, and particularly IMO Sulphur 2020, are an impetus for MSC’s major investment in advanced technologies for reducing air pollution, which is in line with the objectives of SDG 13, Climate Action.
As a forward-thinking family company with an innate passion for the sea, SDGs 14 and 15, focused on Life below Water and Life on Land respectively, are key considerations for sustainability action at MSC. This encompasses initiatives aimed at conserving marine life, such as responsible ballast water management, oil pollution prevention and waste management, slow steaming, programmes which reflect the many significant linkages between business and the natural environment and the associated connections to communities, livelihoods, and well-being.
Risk assessment and management, a safe working environment, and employee training are also consid- ered as cross-cutting issues related to how we promote respect for human rights and ethical business practices. We deliver on this by focusing on SDG 3 (Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and by taking into account our sector’s complex regulatory frame- work. This includes the implementation of strict safety policies and procedures, the availability of protective and security equipment on board, and the provision of comprehensive computer-based, onshore and onboard training and professional development programmes. In addition to our internal measures, we also support activities and development projects carried out by a variety of stakeholders, well beyond compliance.

STAKEHOLDERS
As a global company with interests all over the world and given the nature of our business activities, MSC regularly interacts with a wide range of stakeholders from the public sector, financial institutions as well as partners and players belonging to almost all sectors. Therefore, MSC’s 2018 Sustainability Report was prepared with a view to address diverse stakeholders’ expectations and involved the participation of a multi- disciplinary team with expertise in each Sustainability Pillar. The drafting process included several months of internal consultations involving professionals at all levels based at the Headquarters, in the MSC Agencies, in MSC Shipmanagement offices and in each of the entities of the MSC Group of Companies. This partici- patory approach helped to identify and address the most relevant material issues and prioritise key challenges and progress made since 2017.
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION
As part of our strategic approach to sustainability and to better raise awareness on our sector’s sustainability matters and related considerations, throughout 2018 MSC has further strengthened the collaboration between the Sustainability Teams and the Marketing Department. Our approach was summarised in a variety of internal communications to management and employees to appeal to a wider internal audience. The topics mentioned in this report also feature in MSC’s internal company magazine, along with explanations of the UN Global Compact and UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Additional corporate communications channels, such as our global Intranet, website, and social media accounts were also regularly updated by a dedicated team of experts. To further raise the profile of MSC’s Sustainability efforts as an integral part of the Company’s external relations, flag speaking appearances by company experts and executives at international conferences on sustainability-related topics were organised throughout the year.
SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE
MSC has a Group Executive Sustainability Steering Committee led by the leadership and executives from the Headquarters in Geneva. The Committee is respon- sible for providing strategic guidance and directions on MSC Sustainability strategy and broader economic, social, and environmental matters.
Key departments such as the MSC Corporate Legal Department, the Corporate Audit Department, the Global Human Resources Department, and the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Department, are actively engaged in strengthening the ongoing harmonisation aimed at further promoting ethical and good govern- ance practices throughout MSC value and supply chains. These include employees as well as third parties, local and international business partners, and other relevant stakeholders.
Subject matter experts within each relevant department are responsible for advising, providing training, and supporting the integration of ethical and sustainability matters into the daily work of the value and supply chain. They also track operational, environmental, social, and economic performance and report on progress and/ or advise about improvements whenever necessary in their respective areas of expertise.
The MSC CSR Department, based at MSC Headquarters, complements efforts carried out by other key MSC Departments by continuously improving existing responsible environmental and social organisational processes and practices in collaboration with relevant functions and MSC Agencies worldwide. These include the involvement of relevant MSC subject matter experts in auditing processes and/or other evaluation mechanisms carried out under the standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and by other third parties on issues related to sustainability, human rights, and labour standards.
14 MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT AND GOVERNANCE

A CROSS-DEPARTMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS FUNCTION
In line with its commitment to continuously improve internal processes, MSC introduced a cross-departmental human rights function to support key HQ Departments by further bringing a human rights lens to their respective existing activities and practices. To illustrate, relevant human rights issues, including those related to modern slavery, in accordance with the standards contained in
the MSC Code of Business Conduct, were incorporated into the regular internal auditing practices. The “Social Virtual Audit” was launched online in 2018 for MSC Agencies with the aim of having a preliminary human rights risk assessment.

FREIGHT TRANSPORT AS ENABLER OF OTHER SECTORS’ ACHIEVEMENTS
As stated by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) “the 2030 Agenda does not include a dedicated goal on transport, yet the strategic importance of the sector as a cross-cutting factor that can enable the realization of various Goals is widely recog- nized.”2 It is also widely recognised that maritime and intermodal freight transport is an enabler of other sectors’ achievements as over 90% of goods3 are transported by sea and approximately 180 million4 containers are moved around the world every year.
The transport of goods between the continents, wherever there is a need for it, is a prerequisite for growth and development, including for ensuring the enjoyment of basic needs for the world’s population. According to the World Bank “around the world, in much of development
work, transport is the ultimate enabler. By serving other sectors of a nation’s economy, it puts development goals within reach. We know, for instance, that an estimated 75 percent of maternal deaths could be prevented through timely access to childbirth-related care, facilitated by transport. We know that girls’ enrolment in education can more than triple after completion of a rural road. And, we know that lowering transport costs along a modern- ized international corridor can unlock growth potential, create jobs, and bring wealth to local communities.”5 Indeed, during the last century, shipping companies have significantly contributed to increase global wealth, other sectors’ sustainable growth and world trade by offer- ing transportation solutions to millions of customers at competitive costs with reliable and reduced transit times.
CONTRIBUTING TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AROUND THE WORLD
LINKING SUPPLY CHAINS
Over the past fifty years MSC has been carrying products, commodities, food, and people all over the world becoming one of the key leaders in the interna- tional shipping sector. Globally, our business activities have supported the development of international trade, dramatically contributing to foster inclusive social and economic growth. Today, our operations and logistics services provide consumers based around the globe with just-in-time delivery of all kind of products at
affordable prices and continue to stimulate the growth of local industries as well as to bring long-term devel- opment across continents.
To allow producers and business partners to deliver their products to consumers in a safe, fast, efficient, and sustainable manner we invest and rely on a fully integrated system with strong mutual dependencies. This improves resource management and efficiency as well as reducing operational costs while enhancing collaboration with all actors across our complex value and supply chain.

ADDRESSING PRESSING GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES
According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)6 over the past years, the global challenges to sustainable develop- ment have been driven by a broad set of ‘megatrends’, such as changing demographic profiles, chang- ing economic and social dynamics, advancements
in technology, and trends towards environmental deterioration. Being a truly global company, political, economic, social and technological megatrends as well as evolving trade patterns have always been at the centre of our decision-making process and continue to be taken into account when developing our business strategies. Since 1970, when our first one- vessel operation started, MSC’s long-term vision, passion, and approach to shipping have not diminished.

 MAXIMISING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH OUR GLOBAL NETWORK
We keep increasing physical connectivity between populations and countries by continuously expanding and adapting our trade routes and liner services. As an illustration, throughout 2018, MSC has focused its efforts on enhancing its Intra-Asia network, connecting countries in South Asia with key hubs in China and developing new business opportunities for shippers. In 2019, we also plan to offer new services in Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Through our global network of MSC Agencies, we ensure that local specificities are taken into account in our business activities. This allows us to further tailor
our services and operations to local needs, customers and other stakeholders’ expectations, and enhancing long-term partnerships with governments, financial institutions, and business partners.
MSC Agencies are responsible for commercial and operational activities in each of the countries where global shipping and transportation services are provided. They are directly supervised and regularly managed from the Headquarters by the Agencies Department.

BRINGING VALUE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES
  “Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all.”
 OUR IMPACT TO SDG 9: INDUSTRY, INNOVATION, AND INFRASTRUCTURE
MSC invests heavily in filling infrastructure gaps in both developed and developing countries through its subsidiaries, TiL and MEDLOG. In particular, we strive to contribute to the modernisation and development of terminals as well as national, regional, and international freight corridors. This contributes to increase energy and operational efficiency, enhance countries’ competitive- ness at a regional and global level as well as to enable our customers, local stakeholders, and business partners to effectively benefit from our global network.
As stated by the United Nations, Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) “better infrastructure reduces transaction costs, makes capital goods more durable and facilitates trade and investment. Solid
infrastructure creates more business opportunities and boosts private entrepreneurship. Investment in regional transport systems and communications is also crucial for the facilitation of economic integration, the development of markets, and the promotion of intrar- egional trade.”7
To maximise our contribution to sustainable devel- opment and governmental efforts in this respect, our investments are based on extensive assessments of market outlooks, social needs, and geographical landscapes. Our private-public partnerships (PPPs)8 are in line with international standards and national development plans. By doing so we support countries to meet their respective strategic development priorities and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes in the long term.
7 https://stats.unctad.org/Dgff2016/prosperity/goal9/target_9_a.html
8 https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/sector/transportation/ports: “With the majority of global trade carried by sea,
developing strong, well-functioning maritime transport infrastructure is a key element of economic growth for many developing and emerging countries. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) in ports have become a means to manage port operations more effectively, traditionally an exclusively government function. Different port management structures are used worldwide but in the majority of large and medium sized ports the landlord port model is used. In this model management responsibilities are delegated to the private sector, while the title in the land and assets remains with the government.”

  TIL’S KEY IMPACTS
• Modernisation of existing infrastructure and/or greenfield terminals, some in collaboration with
the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a branch of the World Bank and individual Governments (PPPs)
• Massive investment in resilient infrastructures and in adaptation to climate change (Infrastructures are designed and built in specific landscapes to address climate change challenges)
• Leapfrogging of state-of-the-art technologies & equipment
• Ensuring Health and Safety best practices and management systems
• Minimise environmental impacts
• Promotion of efficient natural resource management
• Addressing growing coastal urbanisation/terminal congestion through operational efficiency
• Creation of local direct and indirect jobs

 CASE STUDY
IMPLEMENTING RESPONSIBLE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
BRASIL TERMINAL PORTUÁRIO (BTP)
 Brasil Terminal Portuário (BTP) is the leading port opera- tor in Brazil and the largest container terminal in South America that is managed and operated under a joint venture agreement by Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), MSC’s subsidiary, and APM Terminals, both world leaders in the container handling market. A privileged location and routes serving all regions of the world are some of the main characteristics of the terminal. BTP strives to position itself as a reference in the port and terminal sectors not only by boosting the inclusive economic growth of the region through its economic performance but also by promoting responsible social and environmental management systems in compliance with international standards.
LAND RECOVERY:
PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
BTP is a container handling terminal strategically locat- ed on the right bank of the Port of Santos, in a projected area of 490 thousand sqm. For over five decades, the place where the terminal is located was among the

largest environmental liabilities of the State of São Paulo, and the largest port area in the country. Formerly known as the “Antigo Lixão da Alemoa” (Alemoa’s Former Dumpsite), the land lot was a mangrove that received all kinds of waste products for five decades, as well as debris from the activities devel- oped in the Organized Port of Santos.
In October 2009, BTP started environmental remedia- tion of the land, which was completed in March 2012. Approximately 1.14 million tons of contaminated soil were removed from the site and 17,500 truck trips were needed to transfer the soil to an industrial yard approved by the Environmental Agency of the State of São Paulo (CETESB) to eliminate all contaminants and restore the area to its original purpose. The terminal was officially opened in November 2013 and in June 2015, BTP received the official certification from the relevant environmental authority attesting the full recovery of the area.

 TERMINAL’S EXPANSION PHASE
The construction of the greenfield terminal was financed over a syndicated loan of USD 182,4 million (May 2006), in compliance with the Equator Principles. On October 2007, Portonave received its first container ship.
In 2015, Portonave was expanded to more 130 thousand square metres, enhancing its static capacity to 30 thousand TEU. This required an investment of a total amount of USD 30,74 million, co-founded by Brazilian internal banks (debentures). After completion of the enlargement project, the yard become about 400 thousand square metres, the equivalent of 40 soccer fields. It is important to note that this work did not directly impact the community, once the activities were concentrated in the Direct Influence Area (AID) of the project, which is comprised in the areas owned by the terminal. The main impacts related to vehicle movement, particle suspension, and noise were limited to the benefit of the project. To avoid potential identified risks a wide range of mitigation procedures and strate- gies were put in place.
In addition to the license requirements, as compen- sation for the local impacts on land and biodiversity, Portonave invested in a wide range of environmental initiatives and the ‘Nossa Praia Project’, in partnership with Navegantes’ municipal government. Considered one of Brazil’s most important shoreline recovery works, the Nossa Praia project covers an area of 102 hectares of Navegantes’ beaches. The initiative aimed to recover the native ecosystem (called “restinga“) through actions such as removing exotic vegetation, planting native species, rebuilding dunes, and closing irregular access trails. In addition, the project also included the revitalisation of the beach waterfront, the construction of a deck and the lightening of bicycle paths.

 CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Today, Portonave has an Integrated Management System (SGI) which ensures that operations and activ- ities comply with applicable domestic law, regulations and requirements as well as with applicable interna- tional standards, guidelines, and indicators on quality, environment, work safety, and health. The system is regularly reviewed and improved by the Management and/or the Board of Directors whenever necessary. Macroeconomic, regulatory, financial, social, and environmental matters – including climate issues – are part of the Company’s Risk Matrix. SGI’s fundamental principles also include requirements on standards in which the terminal is certified: ISO 9001 (Quality Management), ISO 14001 (Environmental Management) and OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Management). An independent external organisation annually audits the SGI to verify non-compliances and/or opportunities to improve. Computer systems and access control processes for people, vehicles, and cargoes are also regularly audited.
INVESTMENTS THROUGH INCENTIVE LAWS
Every year, Portonave invests in several projects approved under incentive laws to further ensure that the wealth generated by its activities will particularly benefit the population of Navegantes and its surroundings. In 2018, Portonave invested USD 723,000 in a wide range of activities and projects for the local community in the areas of health, education, sports, and culture. These included contributions to a number of initiatives for students such as ‘Music in Schools’, ‘Street Soccer for Education’, and ‘Training Center for High Performance Artistic Gymnastics (Curitiba – PR)’.
YOUNG TALENT PROGRAMME – YOUNG APPRENTICE PROGRAMME
In 2008, Portonave created the Young Talent Programme, which offers high school students from Navegantes’ public schools the opportunity to enter the labour market, combining practical experience and theoret- ical learning. The programme benefits young people aged between 16 and 18 years old having a per capita family income lower than the minimum wage in line with national minimum age requirements. Hired as apprentices, the young people stay for up to one year in the Company and work in different areas of the termi- nal, guided by Portonave’s professionals. Since 2008, 108 students completed the programme. The hiring rate of young people who successfully completed the programme is 48%.

PARTNERING TO DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES IN PRODUCER COUNTRIES
In some cases our customers gained understanding on how to access new trade opportunities, expand their local business activities to global locations as well as to increase their market shares.
As an illustration, SanLucarTM, a Spanish fruit exporter, has started to use our latest controlled atmosphere technology to ship its first cargo of blueberries from Spain to the Middle East. “This innovative system regulates the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (02) inside the transport container, reducing and elimi- nating the ethylene released by the fruit. Thanks to this
technology, it is possible to slow the natural ripening process of the fruit down, to extend its shelf life while preserving all its freshness and quality. All these benefits are especially important for a product as delicate as blueberries, and essential to maintain the premium quali- ty of the fruit and vegetables that SanLucar produces and sells worldwide.”12

CLIMATE & ENVIRONMENT: DEFINING TOPICS OF OUR TIMES
Throughout business, policy and civil society forums, on screens, in print and on social media, the topics of climate and the environment are centre stage. This is understandable, given the increasingly evident impacts of climate change, together with the warnings from the scientific community, notably the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC13) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES14) about the state of our planet. Accordingly, sustainability is on the agenda of every major company in the world. At MSC, our concern for the environment begins with the seas and stretches beyond these horizons. We understand that marine and terrestrial ecosystems are linked through myriad complex physical and biological interactions. It is highly appropriate therefore, that our actions to protect the environment are numer- ous, diverse, and prioritised in areas where we can have the greatest positive impact.
          A SECTOR MOVING FORWARD
At MSC, we are very proud of our nautical heritage and strong business performance. We are also proud of the broader role of the shipping sector in driving the global economy, connecting people and goods, and of our efforts to do this in a way that is socially inclusive and sustainable. We believe that the evolving regulatory landscape and rising expectations of customers, stake- holders and investors -which present challenges to the shipping industry- can also be a positive force that drives progress and creates a shift towards more sustainable business. As an industry leader, we feel a particular responsibility to rise to these challenges and respond in a comprehensive, proactive and participatory way.
Partnering for progress
MSC considers that people, and especially dialogue and exchange, will drive the sustainability agenda and advance the sector forward as a whole. Participation in international industry and sustainability forums are essential for strengthening collaboration, formulating policy-based and technical solutions, sharing best practice and planning for the continued success of the sector as a whole. MSC participates in a wide range of environmental, sector specific and sustainability-focused organisations, some of which are summarised below.

THE PATH TO SUSTAINABLE SHIPPING
Environmental protection is a topic that is relevant totheworkofmultiplebusinessareasespeciallyina large global company such as MSC Shipmanagement, procurement, certification, compliance, and opera- tionsdepartments,tonameafew,takeenvironment and sustainability into consideration in their activities. As sustainability risks and opportunities become better understood, teams addressing supply chain, human resources, finance, and insurance are increasingly factoring the environment into their decisions. At MSC, sustainability is not a single department, but a mindset, that we seek to embed throughout the Company. Similarly, there is no one ‘solution’ for sustainability. The path to sustainable shipping involves commitment, innovation, dialogue, advocacy, and investment. The following sections demonstrate some of the work of MSC in these areas.
SAVING ENERGY AND REDUCING EMISSIONS
MSC engineers and design teams are constantly working to reduce energy consumption and therefore the Company’s CO2 and other air emissions. There are multiple ways in which MSC is making progress in this regard. The actions of MSC in this area respond to the Sustainable Development Goals 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) especially. MSC’s work on energy efficiency and the fleet retrofit and newbuild programmes make a particularly strong contribution to targets 3.8, 7.3 and 9.4, referring to air pollution, energy efficiency, and resource-use efficiency and environmentally sound technologies respectively.
Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI)
In 2011, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted the EEDI, the world’s first globally binding design standard that aims to drive improved environmental performance of ships by requiring them to become more energy efficient. Almost all new ships are subject to the standards, which will become increasingly stringent over time. For MSC, efficiency is an environmental imperative that also has cost benefits. Work in this area is already well underway to optimise vessel performance and to even go beyond the regulatory requirements if possible.
One way that MSC achieves optimal fleet efficiency is by ensuring vessels are modern with the latest advances in design and technology, details of which are outlined in the sections below. Further, through investments in capacity management and economies of scale, MSC has increased average capacity per ship from 2,500 TEU in 2003 to 6,500 TEU in 2018, which is significantly higher than the average figures that can be found on the market.
Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI)
MSC uses the EEOI to record and analyse individual ship and entire fleet performance over time. EEOI is a tool set out in the IMO Guideline MEPC.1/circ.684, which gives a reliable indication of ship performance in terms of transport work. It provides data on the fuel efficiency of a ship in operation as well as the impact of operational enhancements or modifications such as better voyage planning or more regular propeller and hull cleaning. EEOI is defined as the ratio of mass of CO2 emitted per unit of transport work (unit = gr CO2/Tons cargo/miles).
50 ENVIRONMENT

 Fleet-Network-Terminal Efficiency Team, Geneva Headquarters
MSC FLEET CARBON EMISSIONS 2015-2018
Since records began, MSC has substantially reduced emissions per ton of cargo. Our EEOI analyses for 2018 indicate an improvement of 13% since 2015. In addition to this, MSC has been awarded the Energy Efficiency Operational Index Certificate by a globally recognised third-party auditing company. This certifies the accuracy and usability of the monthly EEOI figures calculated by MSC Energy Efficiency (EE) team.
Delivery of new Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULCVs) scheduled for 2019 and 2020 will further reduce emissions per amount of cargo carried. These mega-ships will be propelled by ultra-efficient G-type engines, will include the latest energy-saving technologies in line with the EEDI standards, and some of them will have an air lubri- cation system to further reduce friction of the hull, which translates into substantial emissions reductions.

Real-time monitoring
Performance monitoring at MSC is led by the Geneva-based Energy Efficiency (EE) team and MSC Shipmanagement. The EE and MSC Shipmanagement teams continuously monitor the emissions and fuel performance of the fleet. To ensure the information available is accurate, detailed, and current, MSC has invested heavily in real-time performance monitoring. As a result, MSC now operates a world-class fleet monitoring system. It provides vessel-specific infor- mation-rich ‘dashboards’ to technical, operational, and voyage planning staff with instantaneous details on, for example, engine power and output, fuel consumption and speed, as well geographical information such as route, location, and environmental zone. In addition to allowing specific voyages to be planned, observed, and optimised in view of load and weather conditions, the system provides invaluable data to Shipmanagement for decision-making on vessel maintenance and upgrades, to ensure optimal performance. This also allows monitoring of vessels with regard to the Company’s navigational policy compliance and security measures. MSC is committed to transparency and compliance on environmental performance. The data collected from various sources, including the real-time monitoring system installed on MSC vessels, contributes to this by providing the Environmental Ship Index (ESI) scores required by port authorities and the Clean Cargo Working Group for their emissions calculations. The ESI is used to identify vessels that perform better than IMO standards requirements in terms of emissions. The index assesses the amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) emitted by a vessel and provides a reporting scheme on its greenhouse gas emissions. In this way, the ESI is a useful additional indicator of a ship’s environmental performance. Recognition by port authorities of the leading environmental performance of MSC ships is evident in the extent of incentives provided based on ESI scores.
Vessel adaptations and enhancements
An extensive and comprehensive retrofitting programme for the entire existing fleet is underway at MSC to reduce emissions and achieve fuel consumption reductions. By the end of 2018, more than 200 adaptations had been made as part of the MSC ‘Eco retrofit’ programme to optimise fleet performance. This represents a significant area of investment for MSC. For example, MSC has invested EUR133 million in the propeller retrofit programme and well over EUR47 million in the bulbous bow retrofit. While the benefits of these modifications vary from ship to ship, together with the fact that MSC operates one of the youngest fleets in the world, they contribute strongly to the impressive environmental performance of the fleet.
In 2018, we revised our methodology for analysing fuel savings, considering a wider range of factors than previously. Based on our calculations, we estimate that the hull and propeller cleaning alone have resulted in a saving of 55,000 tons of fuel, with a consequent emissions reduction of 179 million kg CO2.

Receiving recognition for performance
The efforts by MSC to prioritise sustainable use of marine resources and investments in green technologies, and the notable successes achieved, have been widely recognised by global certification schemes and award schemes. For example, in 2018, MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company was delighted to win the title of ‘Greenest Shipowner of the Year’ at the annual Green Shipping Summit in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The award recognised MSC’s retrofitting of hundreds of ships with technologies for energy efficiency, as well as the extensive investments to prepare for upcoming regulatory changes regarding marine fuel use.
MSC Shipmanagement also claimed several significant regional prizes in 2018, including Green Company of the Year Awards in both India and Ukraine. In California, the state government has been actively encouraging shipping lines to switch to shore power while in port, to reduce air pollution in urban areas. MSC was grateful
to the Port of Oakland for acknowledging the MSC’s 100% record for shore-power ready vessels. Every MSC vessel that called at Oakland in 2018 was fitted with cold-ironing equipment. This enabled MSC to consist- ently connect to the port’s local power connection, and thereby comply with local regulations.
Standards certification provides robust evidence of MSC’s integration of environmental priorities into management systems. In 2018, MSC Headquarters in Geneva and MSC Shipmanagement in Limassol, Cyprus, and Sorrento, Italy, all received certifications as outlined below. In addition, 2018 saw the extension of ISO 9001: 2015 (Quality management) certification to all MSC Agencies worldwide.

 MSC NEWBUILD PROGRAMME BRINGS LARGER, MORE EFFICIENT, GREENER SHIPS
MSC is committed to reducing the environmental footprint of global supply chains. We have been working closely with shipbuilders, classification societies, design firms, and a wide range of other experts and stakehold- ers to ensure that future investments in our fleet are both economically viable and feature the best available technology and vessel adaptations for environmental performance. In October 2017, MSC confirmed an order for 11 new 23,000+ TEU vessels (Ultra Large Container Vessels – ULCVs), setting a new record for the world’s largest container ship capacity. They can carry around 3,000 TEU more than the current largest MSC ships and will replace a significant number of 13,000 and 14,000 TEU vessels.
These bigger vessels will reduce the energy require- ments needed per container through use of the latest green technologies and economies of scale. The new ships will feature a single engine designed to lower the optimum engine speed and allow the use of a larger, more efficient propeller. MSC is also trialling a new air lubrication system for these ULCVs. This consists of an air blower that causes tiny air bubbles to travel contin- uously beneath the hull, like a carpet of air, to reduce the resistance to ship movement caused by sea water. Even allowing for the energy required to run the system, the reduced friction leads to major fuel savings and a 10-15% net reduction in CO2 emissions.
58 ENVIRONMENT

 To allow for future changes in low-emission technolo- gies available, and possible changes in the regulatory landscape, the newbuilds will burn conventional fuel and use IMO-approved Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS) to provide a safe and practical way to minimise air pollution. The ships have the potential to be converted to run on LNG in the future. To address emissions concerns while at berth, and thus concerns about air quality and human health in urban area, where shore-side infrastructure exists, the ULCVs can cold-iron when in harbour, allowing onboard generators to be shut down.
Cargo efficiency is also closely evaluated at MSC. MSC has carried out several cargo system upgrades to match
the needs of individual ship series and to take into account trade and operational profile. The tailor-made cargo system upgrades increase the average carrying capacity and optimise loading efficiency. This lowers the energy required to transport each container, and therefore reduces emissions too.
MSC takes considerable pride in its dedication to distil 40 years of nautical experience into practical, modern solutions for fleet optimisation. It reflects a company that excels in combining market awareness, adherence to regulatory obligations and leadership, to constantly push the limits of innovation and performance.

 FUEL CAP OF IMO SULPHUR 2020: A GAME-CHANGER
From 1 January 2020, an enhanced global cap on fuel sulphur content set by the IMO will come into place. The aim of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) MARPOL Annex VI Reg. 14 regulation is to control sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions from ships. The regula- tion, which will reduce the sulphur limit for marine fuel from 3.5% m/m (mass by mass), to 0.50% m/m applies to ships operating outside designated Emission Control Areas. MSC strongly believes it has a positive contribu- tion to make to global initiatives to reduce air pollution from ships; we fully support uniform enforcement of the IMO MARPOL Annex VI regulation, as detailed in resolution MEPC 184(59).
In addition to the technical measures described in the previous section to improve fuel efficiency, MSC is continuously evaluating the range of best-practice fuel-related and technical solutions to ensure compli- ance with the IMO 2020 Sulphur Cap. Efforts are currently focused primarily on Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS). EGCS technology offers an economical and environmentally sound solution for addressing all new and existing rules and regulations concerning sulphur emissions from ships. Following extensive research and preparations by the MSC Technical Team, and collabora- tion with leading equipment manufacturers, MSC opted to invest in Hybrid EGCSs. Despite being more expen- sive and not widely available, MSC chose this design because of greater reliability, safety of the crew and, importantly, to future-proof the retrofitted vessels with
60 ENVIRONMENT

regards to environmental protection. Operation of these Hybrid EGCSs generates an emission of SOx equivalent to that from engines using low sulphur (0.1% m/m) fuel. In April 2018, MSC was the first company to invest in this technology, signing a contract for 56 EGCS. Since then, MSC has been signing commercial contracts to ensure that we have sufficient orders for our fleet during 2019 and 2020. MSC is proud of its decision to be a leader among shipping companies in investing in Hybrid ECGS to address its environmental commitment in a practical and quantifiable manner.
Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS)
MSC is already a market leader in terms of the environ- mental performance of its fleet, as evidenced, for example, by the high level of port reduction incentives awarded to MSC, as well as the EEOI performance. Nonetheless, we strive to continuously improve on this, through a sulphur compliance strategy that is deliberate- ly agile, allowing for a response to advances in vessel propulsion technology and changes in the availability and cost of marine fuels.
MSC is also helping to minimise airborne environmen- tal emissions through increased use of shore power supply (‘cold-ironing’). Auxiliary systems such as light- ing, powering reefer containers, air conditioning, and crew accommodation can be powered with electrici- ty from the local grid. By connecting to the grid in this way, instead of relying on onboard generators, ships can reduce their emissions in port by around 80%. MSC is a pioneer in this area, having started the installation of the cold-ironing systems in 2007, and has been recognised by the classification society, DNV GL for its inclusion of cold-iron technology in its newbuild programme. MSC has increased the number of vessels equipped to run onshore supply from 100 in 2015 to 150 by the end of 2018. At present, few global ports feature the technol- ogy required to support these shore power systems. MSC continues to advocate for increased availability of shore power so its vessels can harness this technol- ogy for reducing air pollutions in ports.
   OPEN LOOP SYSTEMS
use seawater to treat
the exhaust gas
CLOSED LOOP SYSTEMS use continuously circulated and recycled water, with the addition of an alkaline chemical
to treat the exhaust gas
Liquified natural gas (LNG) reduces SOx emissions by more than 99% and nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) by up to 85%, as well as carbon dioxide emission (CO2) by approximately 20%. However, LNG is not a viable option at present for our cargo ships owing to the relatively small number of ports with full-scale LNG bunkering facilities and other practical considerations. Another option for staying within the emissions limit is to use low sulphur fuels. This includes the use of Marine Gas Oil (MGO) and blends of Ultra Low Sulphur Oil (ULSFO). The latter is already widely used by MSC, though the future cost, quality, and availability considerations of this option will require thorough evaluation and consid- eration prior to further scaling up. Fuel solutions will form a part of our 2020 compliance strategy, as well as utilisation of EGCS technology.

INVESTING IN ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE
  1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of
the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related ex- treme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks
 “Transport has been traditionally looked upon as a challenge in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and a lot of effort has been rightly directed at that issue. In recent years, however, with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, adaptation of transport to the future climate, once a ‘poor relation’ in terms of climate change response, is increasingly being recognised as vital to the continued success of mobility and global trade and development.”15
In line with the above, MSC’s investments in infra- structure and equipment in some highly exposed geographical areas include costs associated to climate change risks and variability. As an illustration, TiL, MSC’s terminal operator, already invests in cranes and other equipment to reduce the risk of climate change impacts and enhance preparedness in case of natural disasters that might lead to disruption of operations and create risk to employees working in difficult condi- tions. Some of the climate change variabilities taken into account in our decision-making include the rising of sea levels as well as changes in frequency and inten- sity of extreme weather events, including hurricanes and tropical storms.16
In this respect, TiL has incorporated the use of wind tunnel analysis modelling, solid modelling analysis, and Finite Element Analysis in the design of the cranes, and temperature range from -40° C to +50° C in order to increase the stability, improve the performance, reduce the weight, and simulate the reaction of the cranes under various extreme weather conditions.
This resulted in a specific design for cranes installed in locations with extreme weather events such as:
• STS cranes delivered in Freeport Container
Terminal in the Bahamas have been designed
with temporary water ballast reservoirs allowing the terminal, in anticipation of a hurricane,
to pump 300 tons of water in the lower section of the crane structure: this lowers the centre of gravity of the structure, and makes the crane more stable in extreme winds, up to 72 metres/second (260 km/h).
• STS cranes installed in Asyaport Container Terminal in Turkey, where a very high seismic risk is present, have been designed with a seismic isolation system which increases the crane resistance to the oscillation caused by
an earthquake, and limits the damage.
Additional costs for implementing such designs range from USD 250,000 for the engineering to USD 1,000,000 per crane for the enhanced manufacturing. Smaller container handling equipment also benefit from the engineering developed for the larger STS cranes. Furthermore, TiL’s terminals located in some geographi- cal areas considered more exposed and/or vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes such as in Callao (Peru) and in Houston and New Orleans (Gulf of Mexico) have developed and implemented a “Disaster risk manage- ment plan” in line with national requirements. During emergencies, our terminals may also serve as strategic supporting logistic and staging sites, providing power outlets, power packs, lifting equipment, water supplies, and broader assistance to local communities.

TRANSLATING GLOBAL LEADERSHIP INTO SITE LEVEL EXCELLENCE
MEDREPAIR, ANTWERP TERMINAL, BELGIUM
A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO LOGISTICS
MEDLOG is MSC’s rapidly growing logistics arm. Thanks to MEDLOG subsidiaries such as MEDREPAIR, MEDLOG develops and operates inland infrastructures and corri- dors to provide shipment solutions across the world. MEDLOG is fully aligned with MSC’s commitment to safety, energy efficiency, and environmental protection. A prime example of one of MEDLOG’s large-scale logistic investment is the S11 left-bank terminal (‘S11’) in Antwerp. Here MEDREPAIR operates more than 30 empty container handlers, a barge gantry crane, multi-trailer shunts and full reefer monitoring. More than 450 employees work twenty-four hours a day to ensure delivery of constant quality service to meet MSC logistics requirements.
Air quality and combatting trafficking
Ensuring a safe working environment is the primary sustainability concern at MEDREPAIR. This includes, maintaining a high standard of air quality in the workshops through the use of a sophisticated air circulation and filtration system.
The safety programme is led by a manager of health and safety who is responsible for risk assessment and overseeing compliance with Belgian and European standards and regulations.
A safe working environment also includes measures to combat drug trafficking. This spans several corrective and preventive measures including installing fencing and barriers, night guards, and camera surveillance. Anti-drug and awareness campaigns, drug inspections, and stronger engagement with police are also key elements of the S11 agenda.
Automation and digitalisation reduce emissions
Automation and digitalisation are key elements of the expanding sustainability policy at MEDREPAIR. In the last three years, MEDREPAIR has invested more than six million in automation and digitalisation. This has modernised data-sharing and reporting whilst greatly reducing the requirements for paper and printing. Streamlining inspection processes in the yard has reduced the number of forklifts moves with measurable gains for fuel efficiency. A study is also underway to examine feasibility of deploying robotised trailer systems and container tugs at the site. Measures already in place to optimise equipment efficiency, with benefits for emissions reductions, include the use of spreaders that can carry two containers instead of just one. Electric gantry cranes are used with semi-automatic steering and twin-lift spreaders. This has improved the number of barge moves per day, which in turn reduces truck congestion.
Energy, air, and water
There are two wind turbines installed at S11, with proposals under consideration to scale-up wind and solar energy production to 5,000 Megawatt/yr. Energy- saving measures on the site include motion-activated LED lights and automatic power-off functions of cranes and showers. Cleaning of containers has been optimised to save time and energy through the use of blowing/ sweeping processes and deployment of state-of-the-art high-pressure cleaning systems. Water-saving measures have also been put in place at S11. Rainwater is used for toilets and grey water from cleaning stations is removed for treatment. Concrete floors are oil resistant, allowing the separation of grease from water.
64 ENVIRONMENT

 Waste management
At S11, aluminium, steel, iron, copper, wood, foam and refrigerants and plastic are separated and, as far as possible, recycled. Plastic drinking cups are no longer used. Sustainability is incorporated into procure- ment processes by purchasing more environmentally friendly consumables such as water-based reefer foam, solvent-free paint, and recycled paper (as well as only low-sulphate diesel). Waste volumes are reported by type to the authorities.
Mobility
Antwerp is known for traffic congestion, partly due to high container volume created at the port. To help reduce this issue, S11 operates throughout the night. MEDREPAIR participates in working groups with the port authorities with the goal of optimising transit of containers and reducing congestion and unnecessary emissions. MEDREPAIR also encourages low-emission mobility amongst staff and has 40 e-bikes on lease to encourage cycling to work. Finally, MEDREPAIR contrib- utes to scoping of ideas for investment in sustainable mobility by participating in the Board of Innovation run by MSC Belgium.

SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT
MEDLOG IN SOUTH EAST ASIA
The supply of freshwater on earth is precious, and constantly dwindling. MSC has a range of programmes in place both on board and on shore, to conserve water where possible. The following examples illustrate how MSC transport and logistics company, MEDLOG, provides wastewater treatment facilities in two regions of the world with high populations water concerns and limited supply of fresh water.
JAKARTA, INDONESIA
The urban area of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, is home to 10.6 million people17. Rapid population growth is putting enormous pressure on water supplies and contributing to problems of water contamination18. The local MEDLOG CPC Depot installed a wastewater treat- ment system to help combat water pollution, locally. The system removes organic compounds, suspended solids and microbial pathogens. Residue removed from treated water is collected and disposed of at approved locations. Water that has been treated at the site meets the nation- al standards for water quality (Ministry of Environment decree no. 68/2016), allowing it to be disposed in the public sewer, ensuring that water released does not contaminate municipal facilities. 5,000 litres per day are treated at this Marunda Depot site.
HAI PHONG, VIETNAM
Hai Phong is the third largest city in Vietnam19, located about 100km from capital Hanoi. In recent years, the city has evolved rapidly as a commercial and population centre. This growth has put a strain on the city’s infrastructure, especially for water supply and sanitation20. Recognising the need to avoid pollution from the MEDLOG site, the MEDLOG GFS Depot installed additional water tanks to treat the water on-site. Once treated, the water is safely released into the municipal system, where it is subject to further filtration and recycling processes to ensure it meets Vietnamese government standards for safe discharge. More than 1,500 litres of water are filtered per day at the Hai Phong site.

CONSERVING LIFE BELOW WATER, AND ON LAND
 “The ocean provides food, energy, water, jobs and economic benefits for people in every country, even those that are landlocked. It is a crucial buffer against climate change,
and a massive resource for sustainable development.
The health of our oceans and seas is inextricably linked with the health of our planet and all life on Earth.”
H.E. António Guterres, United Nations Secretary General Opening remarks to the Ocean Conference, 5 June 2017
Communities all over the world depend on healthy oceans and functioning marine ecosystems for food and livelihoods. Yet, marine environments are increasingly threatened and degraded by ocean warming, plastic and microplastic pollution, sewage and chemical discharge, invasive species, and overfishing. Safeguarding marine ecosystems is a central tenet of SDG 14, ’Life Below Water’. Given MSC’s inherent connection with the seas, we do not undertake our environmental responsibilities in this regard lightly.
  FACTS & FIGURES
• Biodiversity: The world’s oceans contain somewhere between 500,000 and 10 million marine species
• Oxygen source: Marine phytoplankton
(the plant components of the plankton community) produces 50% of the oxygen on earth
• Carbon sink: Oceans have absorbed as much as half of all anthropogenic carbon emissions over the past two centuries. ‘Blue carbon’ ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrass beds, tidal marshes, and other marine and coastal vegetated ecosystems are among the most intense carbon sinks on the planet
• Oceans at risk: Today 60% of the world’s major marine ecosystems that underpin livelihoods have been degraded or are being used unsustainably

BALLAST WATER MANAGEMENT
2018 was a significant year for improvements to ballast water management in the shipping industry. It was the first full year after entry into force of the IMO International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (BWM). These regulations aim to protect the marine environment from the transfer of harmful aquatic organ- isms in ballast water carried by ships. In response to these regulations, all new MSC vessels are being fitted with compliant ballast water systems that offer superi- or performance in fresh, brackish, and marine waters. In addition, existing vessels are being retrofitted with ballast units that are also fully compliant with IMO and United States Coast Guard requirements. As speci- fied by the Convention, plans were established in 2012 to schedule the installation either during dry-dock or during voyage. MSC has provided training simulators and online training programmes to familiarise crew with the ballast water management equipment and its opera- tion and has worked closely with leading manufacturers to improve the reliability of this equipment.
PRESERVING WILDLIFE, NOW AND FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
As a company with a strong family ethic, the well-being of current and future generations matters greatly to us at MSC. This includes concern about threatened and endangered wildlife populations that should be an essential part of the natural environment upon which we all depend.
MSC has partnered with various organisations to contribute to protection of biodiversity on land and in the seas. We are signatories of the Buckingham Palace Declaration Against Wildlife Trafficking, a pledge to combat illicit wildlife trafficking. Believed to be worth up to USD20 billion per year, this trade is almost as lucra- tive as the human-trafficking and narcotics and arms smuggling21. The Declaration is an initiative of United for Wildlife, to protect iconic species such as elephants, tigers, and rhinos, in addition to less well-known species including pangolins. MSC is also a member of the Task Force taking a stand against illegal wildlife traffick- ing by operating a zero-tolerance policy on the trade of endangered species or banned wildlife products. In 2018, MSC banned the carriage of animal hunting trophies and endangered shark fins. MSC will continue to advocate for improved systems of detection and information-sharing on suspicious activities related to illegal wildlife trade.

The speed restrictions during the period when whales migrate to the area help to mitigate potential collisions in two ways: by reducing the risk of serious or fatal injuries if a strike does occur, and by increasing the odds that a whale will have sufficient time to react and avoid the collision.
Compliance with the programme was verified through
Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from
MSC, and a select number of other companies, for information about a ship’s speed, heading, and location.
SHIPS SLOW DOWN TO PROTECT WHALES
In August 2018, MSC was honoured to receive an award
for setting an industry example by reducing vessel
speeds in areas where endangered whale species feed.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) and the Cordell Bank and Greater Farallones
showing a high degree of cooperation with their vessel speed reduction requests.
The purpose of this speed-reduction programme is to improve air quality, reduce risk of fatal whale strikes, and protect whales within National Marine Sanctuaries, notably blue whales and humpback whales. Ship strikes are a significant cause of whale mortality worldwide.
The four tiers in the award scheme were Bronze (i.e., 10%-25% of their distance travelled at 10 knots or less), Silver (25-50%), Gold (50-75%), and Sapphire (75-100%). MSC was the only company to achieve the Sapphire level in both the San Francisco Bay Area and Santa Barbara Channel region.

MAREVIVO’S YOUTH-FOCUSED EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES FUNDED BY MSC
Since 2015, MSC Cruises has been involved in the work of Marevivo, an Italian marine conservation association. Marevivo’s aim is to raise the profile of marine pollution and involve the public and media in protecting the seas. Marevivo’s activities span biodiversity conservation, sustainable development, enhancement and promotion of marine protected areas, environmental education, and combating pollution and illegal fishing.
MSC applauds the national and global advocacy work of Marevivo, which calls for enactment of laws to protect marine ecosystems.
In 2017, Marevivo successfully lobbied for bans on the use of microplastics in cosmetics and personal care products. Throughout 2018, Marevivo worked with the Italian government to approve laws that protect marine resources against exploitation and help to avoid plastic pollution.
Education is vital in improving the understanding of sustainable use and protection of the oceans. In 2018, MSC Group funded three youth-focused educational activities run by Marevivo.

MSC CRUISES: LEADING IN ENVIRONMENTAL EXCELLENCE
ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AT MSC CRUISES
MSC Cruises feels a deep responsibility towards the physical and human environments in which it operates. The current fleet of 15 ships (as of end 2018) is one of the most modern fleets at sea. It is being expanded by the addition of 14 new state-of-the-art cruise ships featuring the latest in environmental and maritime technology. The MSC Group believes that innovation benefits a company in multiple ways. This is especially evident in environmental protection measures. The advances of MSC Cruises in this area are supporting improve- ment and progress in the wider passenger and cargo divisions of MSC.
The environmental efforts of MSC Cruises attracted global recognition from the international classification society. MSC Meraviglia was awarded the ‘8 Golden Pearls’, which is among the highest recognitions a cruise ship can attain for environmental stewardship. In addition, both MSC Seaside and MSC Seaview received the ‘Green Star 3 Design’ from the international classi- fication society RINA for outstanding environmental credentials.
EMISSIONS MANAGEMENT AND RETROFITTING
MSC Cruises is ensuring that environmental perfor- mance is a fundamental feature of ship design. All new non-LNG (liquid nitrogen gas) ships are equipped with hybrid Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS). In addition, MSC Cruises has put in place a robust programme to retrofit older ships to ensure their emissions performance also meets the international standards set by the IMO. By the end of 2019, 11 of 17 ships will be equipped with hybrid EGCS and 74% of total berths will be covered by this technology.
ALTERNATIVE FUELS
To further improve its environmental performance in ports and at sea, MSC Cruises is expanding its use of low-sulphur fuels. This is already standard practice in sensitive locations such as Venice Lagoon, the Norwegian Heritage Fjords, and other locations such as IMO designated Emission Control Areas. With more stringent limitations on sulphur emissions coming into force in 2020 as part of MARPOL Annex VI, MSC has invested five billion to design and build five cruise ships powered with LNG. Compared to standard marine fuels, LNG reduces SOx emissions by more than 99% and NOx emissions by up to 85%. The use of LNG also virtually eliminates particulate matter from the exhaust and can result in up to 20% saving in carbon emissions. These new LNG ships are due for delivery between 2022 and 2027.

WASTEWATER TREATMENT
The use of Advanced Wastewater Treatment Systems (AWTS) is helping MSC Cruises go above and beyond regulatory standards. 50% of the fleet and 62% of the total berths are equipped with AWTS. AWTS treats wastewater to a very high quality by mixing different waste streams together and filtering out the larger components. The resulting water is then processed even further through very fine filtration and treatment systems, to produce effluent that is of a higher standard than most municipal waste requirements around the world. Through the on-board systems, hazardous substances and pollutants are filtered out and digested by bacteria. To avoid risking harm to marine life, the remaining purified wastewater is disinfected by UV processing (never chlorine). MSC Cruises monitors key indicators to ensure any remaining bacteria levels are favourable before discharge. The separated solid residue is removed from the cycle, and dried, compacted
and compressed into high-grade pellets. These pellets can act as a source of fuel for specific on-board energy needs. Depending on the cruise itinerary, MSC Cruises may also offload this dried biomass ashore, where it can be repurposed for energy production. Other liquid waste that may be hazardous to the environment such as cooking oil, oily water, machinery lubricants, and cleaning products are never discharged into the sea but are offloaded ashore by authorised companies.
MSC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 73

STATE-OF-THE-ART SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
Throughout the years, we have taken voluntary steps to equip our ships with state-of-the-art solid waste management and recycling facilities on board. We manage our waste streams in accordance with manda- tory sound environmental principles of the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) and must comply with all regulatory MARPOL (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) requirements to prevent marine pollution.
All organic waste, as well as recyclable disposable items including plastics, metals, paper and glass, are collected and separated by specially trained waste handling crew members. Waste is compacted, separated, or incinerat- ed, and residual waste is carefully delivered to dedicated port facilities.
Training our crew, not only to handle waste, but to under- stand the importance of waste management, is central to what we do. Our crew members receive ongoing training to ensure they remain abreast of the highest standards. MSC Cruises has a Garbage Management Plan for the prevention of pollution by MSC vessels.
The plan goes beyond MARPOL regulations and lays out procedures for the separation, compaction, and reduc- tion of as much garbage as possible. It is a response to the ISO 14001 standard used by MSC Cruises to manage environmental responsibilities in a clear and systematic way. Our ships are equipped with a comprehensive and coherent system to manage all waste aspects on board and ashore and every ship has a waste management plan that details how each type of waste is managed on board.
Every ship in our fleet has an Environmental Officer in charge of the on-board garbage management, who ensures that the Environmental Plan is correctly executed. The officer has the duty to instruct and train the crew about garbage management rules on board. In 2018, MSC Cruises made a commitment under its Plastic Reduction Programme to effectively phase out a large proportion of single-use plastic items from all ship operations and ashore by April 2019. These items have been replaced by environmentally friendly solutions. For example, all plastic straws were replaced by 100% compostable and biodegradable equivalents and drinks are no longer automatically served with a straw.

 TRANSFORMING DEGRADED LAND INTO A MARINE RESERVE
AT OCEAN CAY, BAHAMAS
The programme at Ocean Cay in the Bahamas is one example of how MSC is working to protect marine flora and fauna in a way that is beneficial to communities and aligned with both local regulation and international standards. MSC is transforming an industrial wasteland into a flourishing marine reserve. The island, which was mined for aragonite for more than 50 years before being abandoned, is now subject to an intensive clean up and restoration programme led by MSC. Works to relocate coral, remove invasive species, preserve wetlands, and protect the coastline are all part of the programme. In addition, The Government of the Bahamas, in agreement with MSC management, has committed to designating 64 square miles of waters around Ocean Cay as a Marine Reserve, where human activity is restricted to conserve the natural environment.
Ocean Cay, Bahamas
Ocean Cay is designed to immerse guests in the natural beauty of their surroundings. To achieve this, MSC has engaged a team of local environmental consultants to ensure the island is developed in a way that is responsible, zero-impact, and respectful of Bahamian authenticity. The island will welcome its first guests in November 2019.
Sustainability performance will remain a fundamental priority for MSC Cruises as the range of routes and holiday experiences expands.

LIFE ON BOARD
STAYING SAFE
At MSC, staying safe involves being informed and imple- menting best practice. To achieve this, MSC develops and implements a full programme of safety manage- ment systems, policies, and procedures, in accordance with relevant national laws, international regulations, and applicable ISO standards. MSC management coordinates training and guidance on, for example, the handling and management of hazardous materials, dangerous goods and chemicals to which personnel may be exposed, and maintenance of records of work- related injuries and illnesses. MSC also implements risk assessment procedures and incident investigation to ensure continuous improvement of practices to provide a safe environment for employees.
In 2018, a Health and Wellness Committee has been established at MSC Shipmanagement in Cyprus to address safety themes in a structured manner. One area covered by this Committee is awareness raising on how to avoid the most common type of injuries such as falls, slips, trips, and falling objects. Designated officers on board are trained to provide medical care and to follow appropriate procedures in the event of accidents. Crew members are encouraged to share best practices and promote a culture on board that motivates all crew members to behave in a safe manner. Rank-specific computer-based training programmes are available, which crew members can follow in their own time. During 2018, staff on board completed nearly 100,000 training hours of this computer-based training.
A practical safety measure adopted in 2018 was the installation of safety loops on all vertical ladders accessed by crew in cargo holds, ballast tanks, void spaces, and masts.
Early fire detection
In compliance with international safety regulations, MSC already operates an advanced early-warning system for fire detection on board. Moreover, a significant safety development in 2018 led by MSC Shipmanagement in Sorrento, was the decision to install deck cargo firefighting systems on the 23,000+ TEU vessels due for delivery in 2019 and 2020. This is well in excess of the minimum SOLAS requirements for fire safety. In addition to the cooling effect and reduction of risk to cargo, the large volumes of water pumped by the new system will substantially reduce the fire risk to crews.
Technology supporting safety at sea
Technology is an invaluable tool in ensuring the safety of the crew, vessel, and cargo. For example, vessels are being equipped with a third radar that is over and above statutory requirement, which assists in improving navigational safety. Long rangefinders facilitate correct distance measurements of a vessel’s bow and stern areas distance from the pier while berthing. Master’s Cabins are fitted with Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (ECDIS). To date, a total of 1,900 navigating officers have received training on operating the system. Further, in the interests of maintaining a high standard of crew navigational and vessel operation skills, new simulators have been installed in MSC train- ing centres in Mumbai, Odessa, Sorrento, Montenegro, and Geneva to offer hands-on training opportunities. Across these centres, 300 navigating officers completed simulation courses in 2018, representing a 45% increase on the previous year.

 STAYING WELL
Physical and mental health are critical to safe operation at sea. This is why staff well-being is a crucial aspect of safety which necessitates management attention and a specific set of precautions and procedures. Diet, exercise, attitude, and mental health are examples of topics prioritised at MSC. Nutrition and meal planning are taken very seriously by Shipmanagement, with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines relat- ing to sugar, salt, and saturated fat observed as far as possible. The 2017 Crew Engagement Survey recorded increased satisfaction of the crew with diet on board, relative to satisfaction ratings recorded by the same survey in 2015. MSC also provides training and commu- nicates around the benefits of physical activity on board and on leave. Vessels are equipped with gymnasiums or sports facilities to encourage crew to stay physically active on board, with games and tournaments adding a social dimension.
STAYING CONNECTED AT SEA
Access to social media and online services is a priority for crew seeking to maintain contact with friends and family networks during their time at sea. MSC greatly values staff morale and satisfaction and has invested heavily in the necessary hardware and software to ensure crew can remain connected to the rest of the world via the Internet during their time at sea. The Crew Engagement survey of 2017 demonstrated the benefit of this investment through a substantial improvement in the satisfaction of seafarers with their access to the Internet.
Cybersecurity is a high-priority subject in a world of increasing connectivity and improved communications technology equipment. MSC ships and onshore opera- tions use systems that rely on digitalisation, integration, and automation, all of which call for careful and responsible cyber risk management. The Information Technology team at MSC have developed a four-part approach to protecting the Company and its employees against hackers and online threats.

IMPLEMENTING BEST PRACTICE
Best-practice management of cargo brings multiple safety benefits for the crew, the vessel, and the environment. In 2018, the Cargo Incident Notification System (CINS), of which MSC is an active member, produced best-practice guidelines for managing sensi- tive cargoes (e.g. fragile, flammable, or hazardous). Further, MSC Geneva Headquarters, together with MSC Shipmanagement offices in Limassol and Sorrento are all now ISO 9001:2015 certified. This certification, among other things, provides formal recognition of MSC’s approach to cargo risk assessment and management, and evidence of compliance with related national and international standards.
We are also strengthening our internal systems to prevent cargo-related incidents on board. For instance, in 2018, we launched a new web-based platform called the Dangerous, Sensitive Cargo Management (DSCM) system. This is strengthening our ability to identify and handle sensitive commodities safely. In 2018, MSC implemented a new tool using artificial intelligence to read and analyse dangerous goods declarations, packing declarations as well as, for example, weathering certifi- cates and analysis reports. MSC’s system is advanced, using both optical character recognition and intelligent character recognition technologies to identify and flag potential safety risks posed by cargo.
CRISIS MANAGEMENT AND DUTY OF CARE
MSC’s safety culture is woven into our approach to crisis management. In this area, speed and expertise are central to our success in managing any incidents that may arise. Company-wide experts are deployed to ensure that any emergencies can be resolved swiftly even in the most difficult conditions. An exceptional feature of MSC’s crisis management response is the immediate notification and involvement of senior management. MSC prides itself on responsible and efficient reaction to emergencies. Commitment to rapid and efficient response is demonstrated by Capt. Gianluigi Aponte, the Company’s founder, and Mr. Diego Aponte, President and CEO, who are personally involved in all significant emergency operations.
Duty of care on safety extends to an undertaking by MSC to aid others in difficulty at sea. MSC seafarers are trained to provide assistance in such eventualities, while also maintaining the safety of crew, vessels, and cargo. Throughout 2018, MSC ships undertook 17 separate ocean rescue operations all over the world, including cases of man overboard, stricken vessels, and missing persons. While deviations may incur additional fuel costs and delays, MSC management considers that shipping schedule and cost are secondary concerns in the context of aiding fellow seafarers in distress.

 CASE STUDY
EARTHQUAKE RESILIENCE
MEDLOG IN SANTIAGO AND ARICA, CHILE
Earthquake disaster reduction and sustainable develop- ment have mutually supportive goals. A structure that is built with earthquake resilience and lifecycle perfor- mance in mind also offers better, longer-term safety for its occupants. Preparedness and resilience are at the core of the MSC approach to safety which aims to ensure that employers and workers are adequately protected, have the necessary equipment, know where to go, and understand how to keep themselves safe when an emergency occurs.
Chile is a seismically active country. The country is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a zone that concentrates most of the seismic activity on earth. Two of the most extreme earthquakes in recorded history took place in Chile, the 1960 the ‘Great Chilean Earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 9.4–9.6, and an earthquake of 8.8 on the moment magnitude scale in 2010.
MEDLOG Chile owns two depots and offices, in Santiago and in Arica, both of which have been affected by earth- quakes in the past. In total, MEDLOG Chile has a staff of almost 200. Buildings have been built according to strict Chilean building standards, to support low-risk opera- tion for employees.
In Santiago and Arica, the buildings were designed on a tubular steel frame system, with isolated footing concrete foundations, allowing flexibility and oscilla- tion that in turn dissipate the energy in the event of a seismic movement. The buildings are earthquake- resistant meaning they can resist a high intensity seismic movement without collapsing, thus increasing the safety of staff.
MEDLOG operates within the framework provided by its General Plan of Emergency, which lays out specific recommendations in the event of an earthquake. Prepared in accordance to national legal require- ments, the plan is valid for the office building as well as for the container yard, in both Arica and Santiago. It includes indications on evacuation routes, protection measures inside and outside of the building, and other safety procedures, such as how to avoid the risk of a fire resulting from an electrical failure. In Arica, the plan also includes safety recommendations in the event of a tsunami that may be triggered by the earthquake. Safety measures extend to the yard, where the container blocks in the yard are stacked to reduce the risk of a fall. MEDLOG is currently expanding in Chile, with depots planned for San Antonio, Valparaiso, and Iquique. Construction standards prioritising safety of employees will feature prominently at these locations too.

 CASE STUDY
CREATING ACCIDENT-FREE WORKPLACES ONSHORE LOMÉ CONTAINER TERMINAL (LCT)
The Port of Lomé, in Togo, is home to the Lomé Container Terminal (LCT) operated by Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), a subsidiary of MSC. It has a capacity of 2.2 million TEU, has nine quay cranes, and occupies an area of 54 hectares. Lomé plays a key role in transhipment and cargo distribution in West Africa because it is the only natural deep-water port terminal in West Africa and is a gateway to the landlocked countries of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso. Container traffic handled in 2018 at LCT amounted to more than a million TEU.
LCT runs a range of programmes with benefits for the natural environment and the local community. The safety of personnel on site is also a central sustainability focus at the terminal. Management has committed to an objective of Zero Harm and is deploying a multi- layer plan to achieve this. All levels and departments in the organisation are included in the mission to instil a safety mindset. LCT management is rolling out a series
of comprehensive training programmes and is also driving excellence in safety performance through the implementation of management systems, which have been independently certified by third parties.
Fatal Hazard Standards have been developed at LCT to address the risks arising from vessel operations, working at heights, interface of mobile equipment and pedestrians, and handling of loads and related engineering activities. Once fully implemented, safety measures will include:
• Stacking profiling system at all rubber-tired gantry cranes, to ensure safe stacking of containers
• Pinning stations at the quay under quay cranes to reduce the risk of injury to pedestrians
• Rear detectors and cameras in reach-stackers and empty container handlers, also to avoid accidents involving pedestrians

PROMOTING LEARNING AND LISTENING
  SHARING VALUE THROUGH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Investment in knowledge building and skills develop- ment is part of MSC’s commitments to Sustainable Development Goals 4 (Quality Education) and 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). It is widely understood by managers and human resources professionals that employees who can avail themselves of professional development opportunities feel motivated and more confident on the job. They are also better placed to progress their careers and, importantly, to execute their duties with expertise and accuracy. A skilled workforce is therefore of immediate benefit to the positive atmos- phere, smooth operation and, ultimately, quality service provided by MSC.
MSC believes that everyone can benefit from leadership training; knowledge obtained can enable employees to take on new or additional responsibilities, allowing their careers to evolve. As the fleet grows, so too do career progression opportunities for skilled staff. MSC active- ly encourages all employees to commit to continuous learning and to grow professionally. This is the spirit of value creation and caring for people espoused by MSC, which is part of the unique strength of the Company.
FOSTERING
OPEN COMMUNICATION
As a global company active in multiple countries around the world, MSC has a particularly deep understanding of the importance of communication. The Company has adopted specific measures for promoting open commu- nication, such as creating a positive work environment, providing access to front-line management, encouraging a more vocal culture, and aiming for clarity in all communications.
Safety is an area that benefits from effective commu- nication at MSC. Examples include providing strong, timely messaging about risks and associated precau- tions, or registering the concerns of crew before an accident can occur. MSC also provides opportunities for the crew to express their views on areas for improve- ment, through the biennial MSC Shipmanagement Seafarers Engagement Survey. This has proven an inval- uable tool for obtaining feedback from employees. The survey was first run in 2015. It was run again in 2017, using the same principles and approach to data collec- tion and analysis, but a with a revised, improved format. Questions were posed on 10 key areas, each with eight questions for prioritisation.

Results shared in 2018 showed a high response rate (67%) across crewing units, nationalities, rank, and duration of tenure with MSC, suggesting an interest on the part of most seafarers to express their opinions. Feedback gained through the survey provides valuable information to shore-based staff on areas for improve- ment and prioritisation.
In each of the ten key areas, satisfaction with MSC was well above average, with results showing an overall increase in positive opinion since the previous survey in 2015. MSC crew members have a strong feeling of belonging within MSC and are highly motivated and committed to their personal and professional growth. They are happy with the safety culture on board and reported a noticeable improvement in this area. Feedback from staff on organisational excellence, includ- ing for example timely payment of wages, scored an almost perfect result. Specific areas that were flagged for improvement in the 2015 survey, such as food, provi- sion of more comfortable protective equipment and
better access to the Internet, recorded markedly better scores than in the previous staff engagement survey. It was encouraging to see the survey demonstrate align- ment between crew and MSC Senior Management on the environment as a key issue for all; according to the survey results, seafarers consider that protecting the environment is the utmost priority for the Company and feel that it is their responsibility as seafarers to care for the environment. Areas for management attention that emerged from the 2017 survey relate to information on assignments and also promotion criteria and arrange- ments for seafarers while on leave.
The survey sets another benchmark on key indicators concerning commitment, satisfaction, and well-being of staff and provides an opportunity to further increase the quality of service provided to MSC seafarers.
 MSC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 93

MANAGEMENT OF VESSELS AND CREWING
The exponential growth of the MSC fleet has necessitated the establishment of MSC Shipmanagement offices in Limassol and Sorrento to coordinate all tasks related to technical management of vessels and crewing. Specifically relating to crew, MSC Shipmanagement is responsible for the selection, recruitment, training, professional devel- opment, and management of seafarers, in accordance with international standards.
Everyday operations at MSC Shipmanagement are guided by fundamental objectives which include: Zero Fatal Accidents, Zero MARPOL Incidents, Zero Cargo Damage, and Zero Navigational Incidents. Sustaining growth and performance in these areas has required investment in and enhancement of communications, internal manage- ment processes, and coaching as well as provision of mentoring and training opportunities. Progress is evident in the receipt by MSC Shipmanagement of multiple awards and certifications in 2018, including the Samudra Manthan Award ‘Shipowner/Shipmanager Manning & Training Company of the Year’, the Offing Award for ‘Best Employer for Dry Cargo Vessel – Large Segment’, the Sea job Award for ‘Best Employer of the Year’ (all in India) as well as the title of ‘Shipmanager of the Year’ in Ukraine.
TRAINING: BUILDING AND APPLYING EXPERTISE
Many companies and organisations refer to their ‘safety culture’ but not all are clear on specific intention or implementation. At MSC, we have adopted the term, absorbed it into the Company mindset and embedded it deeply throughout our onshore and on-board operations and procedures. Through the comprehensive MSC programme of awareness, training, checks, and provi- sion of appropriate tools and equipment, we empower our crew to demonstrate and apply this safety-focused professionalism in their daily activities.
Ensuring that MSC remains a high-performance organ- isation demands investment in skills development and professional excellence. MSC is fully committed
to providing training opportunities, both mandatory and optional, to facilitate learning at all levels in the Company. In 2018, MSC Shipmanagement Cyprus ran more than 25 specific training courses to facilitate progression of technical and soft skills of staff; 13,000 employees were trained as part of this, which represents a 15% increase on the previous year.
In addition to training on technical topics via classroom training, computer-based training, and simulator train- ing, MSC Shipmanagement Cyprus coordinates and delivers a Leadership Development Training programme and various soft skills training initiatives. In 2018, 360 employees from management and operational levels participated in these trainings.
At MSC, coaching and mentoring are also components of the learning and development programme. MSC Shipmanagement considers that building and sustaining a coaching culture increases curiosity to learn and promotes fast learning on the job, acquisition of new skills, and employee engagement.
94 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

MENTAL HEALTH
Any comprehensive well-being programme should address both physical and mental health. MSC is working with partner Protection and Indemnity (P&I) Clubs to develop awareness as part of a strategy to provide support for employees. To overcome the loneli- ness on board for example, MSC Shipmanagement regularly evaluates the state of social interaction on board and provides opportunities for seafarers to connect with colleagues.
MSC Shipmanagement is increasingly devoting attention to the topic of mental health, to ensure it is integrated into the broader seafarer well-being agenda.
GROWTH AND EXPANSION
2018 was another year of growth and significant milestones for MSC Shipmanagement. For example, the number of ships managed by MSC Shipmanagement Cyprus has reached more than 200; the number of people employed both onshore and on board is 16,000; the crew retention rate is 98%. Shipmanagement Sorrento now manages 130 ships and has 25,440 seafarers under its management (5,000 with MSC Cargo and 20,440 with MSC Cruises). The increase in the size of the fleet and crew managed from these centres in recent years is a sign of a successful business. It is also a sign of a strong team working well together. MSC will continue to invest heavily in programmes that contribute to employee health, safety, career progression, and job satisfaction.

MSC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 97

PROTECTING THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF SEAFARERS
The international shipping sector is one of the most regulated industries at the global level, expected to comply with a very complex and comprehensive regula- tory framework involving both public and private sector stakeholders.
Therefore, MSC, in addition to domestic legal require- ments and regulations in the countries of operations, must ensure compliance with a wide range of interna- tional standards and requirements defined by maritime and labour conventions adopted at the international level by the United Nations, including the International Maritime Organization (IMO)22 and the International Labour Organization (ILO)23. Auditing processes and/or
other evaluation mechanisms are carried out by relevant Flag State authorities and Port State control authori- ties to ensure compliance on board ships. Crewing companies based at the labour supply countries need to undergo audit and verification by local governmental authorities and/or by third parties such as recognised Classification Societies.
Repatriation, payment of wages, and further protec- tion related to seafarers’ well-being are guaranteed by insurance certificates for each vessel required by the International Labour Organization (ILO) Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (MLC) and issued by insurance provid- ers such as P&I Clubs. Each Club is an independent, not-for-profit mutual insurance association, composed of ship owners and charterer members playing a leading role in coordinating the response to, and management of, maritime casualties as well as in providing coverage against third-party liabilities arising out of the use and operation of ships.24
COMPLIANCE WITH THE ILO MARITIME LABOUR CONVENTION, 2006
Comprehensive human rights protection for over 1,600,000 seafarers25 on board merchant ships is provid- ed for by the provisions set forth in the International Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) which is widely known as the “Seafarers Bill of Rights”and as the fourth pillar of international maritime regulations. Adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2013, as of today the MLC has been ratified by 93 countries representing over 91% or the world’s merchant fleet.
It encompasses all relevant standards of existing ILO maritime labour conventions and recommendations, as well as fundamental principles contained in core International Labour Conventions and the ILO 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

 MLC MINIMUM STANDARDS
1. Minimum requirements for the seafarers to work on board ships
2. Conditions of employment
3. Accomodations, recreational facilities,
food and catering
4. Health Protection, Medical care, Welfare
and Social security protection
5. Compliance and Enforcement
 The MLC includes a “no more favourable treatment clause” for ships of non-ratifying countries. This aims to ensure fair competition for shipowners and respect for human rights and labour conditions for seafarers by ensuring that ships of all countries (whose flag the ship will fly), irrespective of their ratification of the MLC, will be subject to an inspection during their call to a port in a country that has ratified the Convention. This ensures that the ship meets the minimum requirement of the MLC. It also helps to address governance and implemen- tation gaps at the national level related to compliance monitoring mechanisms and/or enforcement of human rights obligations also under Human Rights International Treaties and International Human Rights Law.
MSC implemented a number of proactive measures to ensure proper and timely compliance with the MLC and further enhance the enforcement of the level of human rights protection for its seafarers. In 2012, MSC Shipmanagement Cyprus established a ‘Crew Welfare Department’ with a dedicated MLC Superintendent to ensure that all crew members working on board ships
are provided with adequate standards in line with the MLC and developed a specific policy to guarantee an excellent working atmosphere on board its vessels. The department is responsible for monitoring the compliance with the MLC and for auditing vessels. It also assists and coordinates efforts of other concerned departments to increase awareness about complaint/ reporting procedures and methods available to crew members.
In some areas, MSC exceeds the requirements set forth in the MLC. As an illustration, we have higher minimum age requirements, as only individuals of 18 years old or above can be employed on board its cargo ships, in alignment with MSC Shipmanagement’s Human Rights Policy. Hours of work and rest of crew are checked against the “Rest Hours Record Book” avail- able on board for each seafarer in electronic or paper form to ensure compliance with applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBA) and regulatory require- ments. MSC Shipmanagement also regularly monitors the level of satisfaction of its crew and potential areas of improvement through surveys such as the biennial “Crew Engagement Survey” conducted by a third party. It also encourages a participatory approach with crew members during crewing seminars and at the end of each employment contract.
More information on surveys and our efforts to promote crew well-being, workplace safety, open communica- tion, welfare facilities as available on board (such as free high-speed Internet, quality and quantity of food, capacity building, and training as well as key initiatives to protect crew physical or mental health) are described in the chapter Occupational Health and Safety (pages 79-95).

  POLICIES & PROCEDURES
In recent years MSC Shipmanagement leadership has devel- oped and implemented the following policies:
• Human Rights Policy which supports internationally recognised human rights and applicable labour standards as well as applicable laws, regulations, and prevailing labour relations and employment practices.
• Child Labour Policy which includes minimum age requirements criteria for employment.
• Non-discrimination policy which prohibits any discrim- ination based on any ground, such as sex, race, colour, religion, language, national or ethnic origin, age, disability, political or ideological affiliation, trade union membership, marital status or family responsibilities, sexual orientation or gender identity or on any basis which could have the effect of preferring one group of persons or an individual over another, other than
the basis of qualification, experience, ability, and performance.
• Anti-abuse policy which includes sexual abuse, physical or mental harassment, verbal abuse, or any activity that may offend the dignity of any person or
a group of people. The policy applies to all employees and covers relations with business partners and other stakeholders, such as stevedores and pilots. Specific training and briefings are regularly conducted.
• Disciplinary Policy which includes the obligation to ensure the respect of relevant provisions as set forth in the Human Rights Policy. MSC Shipmanagement may terminate contract agreements or decide not
to engage in business relationships with any entity which has been proven which has been proven in a court of law to have violated human rights and labour standards.
Reporting channels mechanisms to encourage employees to report on human rights issues and potential human rights violations. The identity of the reporting persons is be kept confidential and retaliation is not toler- ated. Reporting channels include:
• The on-board Complaint Procedure/Form as per MLC 2006 requirements.
• An anonymous reporting system where crew can report any grievance/complaint to a dedicated email address.
• Seafarers Feedback form to be provided at the end of each contract.
• Crew Engagement Survey conducted by a third party.
• Face-to-face meetings during various crewing seminars and training sessions.

RECRUITMENT POLICY AND PROCESSES
MSC Shipmanagement Limited recognises that the employment of competent personnel is vital in ensuring that its fleet operates in a safe and efficient manner. Recruitment procedures are handled by MSC Shipmanagement in collaboration with its own crewing offices and in compliance with industry standards and/or with BIMCO CREWMAN26 contracts. These hold licenses issued from national authorities or approved by recog- nised bodies and are audited every year for the renewal of the crew recruitment licenses, MLC compliance certi- fication as well as relevant ISO certifications.
MSC does not charge fees to seafarers at any stage of the recruitment process and our Recruitment Policy includes a rigorous crew selection and engagement procedure ensuring:
• That the requirements are clearly defined in accordance with the statutory requirements of
the relevant flag States, national and international laws, and regulations.
• That those requirements are met by
the employment of suitably qualified and experienced personnel for each position.
• That candidates meet the language
requirements. The Master, Chief Officer, Chief Engineer, and 2nd Engineer must have a good command of the English language and all other officers must have a working knowledge of English in order to understand key commands/instructions and transfer relevant information related to our Safety Management System.
• That Masters employed have knowledge of all quality, safety, and environmental protection policies/procedures and, together with their Chief Engineer, are adequately briefed at the time of joining their respective ships.
Candidates are shortlisted based on their competence and experience and are offered a position to join the Company after successful completion of the Principal’s Approval Joining Process, which is rank-specific, as well as the medical screening test and the mental health assessment.
In accordance with our internal policy, all documents and various certificates such as those required by the International Convention on the Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) confirming candidates’ eligibility and experience, are evaluated and verified with the issuing authorities. All informa- tion is kept confidential in compliance with the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements and is not disclosed or communicated to anybody without due consent of the seafarer.
Seafarers are provided medical coverage and medical benefits during their employment on board ships and also during their leave in their home country. Contracts contain provisions certifying that salaries are paid in cash on board or sent to the seafarer’s bank account in the country of origin. All seafarers payslips are audited during shore inspections and monthly by our Accounting Department. Overtime is paid as per appli- cable CBA agreement.
Upon completion of the employment agreement and in the eventuality of disruption of operations and/or work illness, the Company bears the costs for repatriation arrangements as applicable. In case of disembarkation due to medical reasons, crew members have access to approved medical centres to ensure they receive high quality medical care and are provided with their sickness wages, on a timely basis, as per applicable CBA terms and conditions and regulatory requirements.
26 BIMCO is the largest of the international shipping associations representing shipowners; its membership controls around 65% of the world’s tonnage and it has members in more than 120 countries, including managers, brokers and agents.

TRAINING
In addition to training on technical topics, MSC Shipmanagement coordinates and delivers training of crew on its Code of Conduct, Group Values, Anti-bribery, new regulations such as the GDPR, Health and Wellness, Leadership Development Training as well as on soft skills. In the past three years over 2,500 employees from management and operational levels have participated in this training.
MSC Shipmanagement recruits over 500 trainees (deck cadets, engine cadets, trainee seamen, trainee electri- cians etc.) each year and it has created its own pool of seafarers trained on MSC Culture and Values. As of today, over 35% of its crewing pool consists of personnel who have started their career as cadets with MSC and many of them are now working in ranks up to Master and/or Chief Engineer.
DUE DILIGENCE AND AUDITING
The MLC Superintendent and the Technical Superintendents/Internal Fleet Auditors of MSC Shipmanagement conduct regular inspections on board. Special attention is paid not only to the minimum age of crew members, hours of rest on board, food and living conditions, medicines on board, and visits to doctors, but also to fair treatment of seafarers in the event of a maritime accident, and liability and compen- sation regarding claims for death and personal injury, as well as training and communication tools available on board. During these inspections and audits each crew member is also interviewed to verify the level of aware- ness of MSC’s company policies, including the Code of Business Conduct, Whistle Blower Policy, and MSC’s Online Speak up channel. All findings are reported directly to Senior Management for consideration and immediate corrective action, if appropriate. Respective Flag States and Classifications Societies conduct annual examinations to our ships to ensure proper compliance with the MLC. Port state inspectors further verify compliance during the routine and periodic
port state control examination at the ships’ ports of call. The International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) representatives also visit vessels randomly at various ports as part of their responsibility to monitor the effective implementation of the MLC requirements and standards.
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS
MSC Shipmanagement follows the labour regulations in the respective countries of registration and strictly complies with the terms and conditions of the applicable collective bargaining agreements (CBA) negotiated by the ITF and/or affiliated entities on behalf of the seafar- ers in compliance with the MLC, 2006. Conditions of employment on board are regulated by an applica- ble Seafarer’s Employment Agreement (SEA) as per the applicable CBA and required by the MLC, which is always duly explained to all potential employees before signature of the contract. Seafarers have access to their respective CBAs and their personal data are protected as per the EU GDPR legislations.

PROMOTING RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES
 The UN SDG 16 “Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions” is embedded in our decision-making process and mainstreamed in all our Sustainability Pillars. For instance, MSC promotes the respect of the rule of law by complying at a minimum with all applicable domes- tic laws, internationally recognised human rights and labour standards as well as all applicable environmen- tal regulations and relevant international rules related to freight containers, road, and rail transportation. Additionally, MSC supports the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption. Since 2015, MSC and MSC Shipmanagement follow the guidance provided by ISO 26000 on Social Responsibility27 to further improve and operationalise socially responsible processes and impacts, in line with MSC’s broader sustainability efforts and its commit- ments to the UN Global Compact. The ISO Guidance draws upon the internationally recognised human rights framework, including the United Nations Business and Human Rights framework, supporting companies’ efforts in the fields of human rights, labour practices, the environment, economic viability aspects, fair operating practices, consumer interest, community involvement, and other areas of sustainable development28.
MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH
THE MSC CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT
MSC strives to promote the highest ethical standards of business conduct as set forth in its Code of Business Conduct. To achieve this, training courses with specif- ic modules on all standards continue to be provided to all of MSC’s employees and MSC Agencies around the world on a regular basis via online platforms and/or live sessions. Introductory sessions on the Code are organ- ised for newcomers in the context of their onboarding programme in MSC’s Headquarters.
Throughout 2018, MSC continued monitoring the imple- mentation of the Code of Business Conduct within MSC’s 493 offices around the world, in collaboration with the local Code Implementers. MSC insists on focusing on cultural and linguistic adaptations to embed ethics and values into the corporate culture in the most effective way around the globe and in accordance with applica- ble laws. In this respect, the Code has been translated into 20 languages to facilitate its understanding. Furthermore, the MSC Global Human Resources Department has recently been established within the Agencies Department. Amongst its main objectives, the function works to ensure the Company policies are well established, communicated, and integrated inside each MSC Agency. In order to ensure the effective adoption of these policies, the Global HR Department has launched an MSC Employee Handbook. In line with the MSC values, the handbook encompasses all the MSC global policies and is then enriched and customised at a country level in accordance with relevant domestic laws and requirements, including applicable human rights and labour standards.
 MEMBERSHIPS
We are active members of the Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy (BASCAP) and the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN), both global business networks composed of maritime industry leaders and representatives from both the public and private sectors. We also work with TRACE International, a non-profit globally recognised anti-bribery association.

FIGHTING AGAINST CORRUPTION AT THE HEART OF MSC’S COMPLIANCE PROGRAMME
The fight against corruption is at the core of MSC’s compliance programme. In view of prompting robust anti-corruption measures, MSC has in place policies and procedures that outline responsibilities for all employees around the globe to comply with all applicable anti-cor- ruption laws. MSC has a dedicated internal Anti-Bribery Policy that applies to all employees. Throughout 2018, MSC enhanced the monitoring of the implementation of this policy and of MSC’s anti-bribery e-learning train- ing in collaboration with the local Code Implementers within MSC’s Agencies.
MSC also has in place a Procedure for Gifts and Corporate Hospitality applicable to employees working in MSC’s Headquarters in Switzerland. Throughout 2018, MSC focused on assessing appropriate thresh- olds regarding gifts and corporate hospitality within MSC Agencies worldwide.
Additionally, MSC continued its related endeavours by imposing contractual compliance obligations on identi- fied business partners (such as terminal operators, connecting carriers, etc). MSC also kept encouraging such business partners to operate under a common ethos and share similar principles to those set forth in the MSC Code of Business Conduct.
MSC SPEAK UP LINE
Consistent with MSC’s values, the ability to speak up is a cornerstone for building an open and accountable workplace culture. In 2018, MSC launched the “MSC Speak up Line”, an online platform developed by a third-party service provider, which complements MSC’s existing reporting procedures.
This serves as a mechanism to promote dialogue and to encourage employees worldwide to report any misconduct or violation of laws without fear of retali- ation. Through this reporting system the reporter can, according to applicable laws and requirements, remain anonymous. All reports are carefully and confiden- tially evaluated on a case by case basis by experts in the relevant subject matter. Depending on the report, internal investigations may be initiated, and corrective actions taken where deemed necessary.
  MACN “SAY NO CAMPAIGN”
Since October 2017, MSC has been a member of the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN) which is composed of maritime industry leaders collaborating towards the vision of a maritime industry free of corruption. MACN members work in partnership with local authorities to develop solutions that are beneficial to all and realistic to implement.
In December 2018, MSC joined the MACN “Say No campaign” to tackle corruption practices in certain ports. The campaign has been endorsed by our MSC Group President & CEO and involved all Captains of our fleet who often face demands for bribes or facilitation payments in forms of cash payments, cigarettes, and beverages. It is widely known that at most ports denying such facilitation payments may lead to delays in operations. In this context, to further support the fight against corruption, MSC uses tools and shared principles developed by members of MACN, regularly reports incidents as well as seeks collective actions where challenges remain, with other members of MACN. Since the beginning of the campaign, demands for facilitation payments in concerned ports have been significantly reduced.
Throughout 2018, the majority of Masters and senior officers of MSC Shipmanagement have been trained in anti-bribery matters.
104 BUSINESS ETHICS AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS

COMPETITION LAW
In recent years, challenges due to stricter environmental regulations, volatility of fuel prices, and overcapacity pushed shipping lines to a structural transformation resulting in a proliferation of mergers, acquisitions, and alliances.
In this respect, and to further promote fair business practices and monitor compliance with relevant inter- national regulations, MSC has established the Antitrust, Competition and Regulatory Matters Department within MSC’s Corporate Legal Department. The department is responsible for ensuring compliance with, and prevent- ing infringement of, competition law by MSC business units around the world. To that end, it deploys training courses and guidelines to its employees. The depart- ment also coordinates the filings of Vessels Sharing Agreements (VSA) when required by the laws of the countries in which MSC operates.
VSAs and Alliances often require cargo consolidation between members, offering a more direct route from one port to another. This is because VSA/alliances’ partners rationalise their routes on the trade by multi- plying the number of services within a trade. They also provide better service quality through higher frequen- cy of services and better connectivity. Instead of one long string calling all the ports of the trade, through the Alliance’s network the same ports will be served more directly through multiple longer strings. This has allowed the operation of larger vessels or mega-ships instead of multiple smaller vessels for the offer to match the demand on these services, resulting in economies of scale, reduced fuel consumption, and reduced bunker costs. Efficiencies are increased and the environmental impact is minimised.

MODERN SLAVERY
  5.2 eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation
8.7 Take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking, and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms
  Article 4 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights clearly states that “no one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms”.
Strongly committed to act with integrity and to promote and support fair, ethical, and responsible business practices, MSC condemns and prohibits slavery and human trafficking practices in all its business activities and endeavours.
MSC’s efforts to tackle modern slavery are fully support- ed and endorsed by MSC’s top management. The MSC Code of Business Conduct includes dedicated sections in this regard. Our progress made in this regard and ongoing processes aimed to identify, mitigate, and, whenever possible, prevent the risks of modern slavery, slave-like practices, and human trafficking in MSC’s operations and its value and supply chain are described in our Modern Slavery Transparency Statements. The statements are published every year, in line with Section 54 of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015.
The responsibility to respect human rights and inter- national labour standards includes concrete actions to ensure we are not being complicit in human rights abuses and to prevent them whenever possible. Therefore, we keep encouraging identified business partners to adhere to all applicable anti-slavery and human trafficking laws including, but not limited to, the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 as well as to share similar standards to those set out in the MSC Code of Business Conduct. We also expect them not to have been convicted of any offence involving slavery and human trafficking.
Additionally, MSC monitors relevant developments in both the national and international regulatory frame- works, including in the areas of modern slavery and human rights, to continuously align and/or further improve its current policies and procedures.

  LABOUR INCLUSION CAMPAIGNS IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
MSC supports and invests in training programmes in different parts of the world to unlock the potential of young people. In line with the ILO MNE Declaration (5th Edition, 2017)29, MSC believes that the prevention of child labour can also be pursued by creating opportunities for youth employment and encouraging skills formation and development through apprenticeships.
In offering such opportunities, MSC acts in compliance with applicable national laws, regulations, and require- ments, ensuring the respect of the children’s rights to attend and/or complete compulsory schooling.
As an illustration, in 2014 MSC Dominican Republic launched two “Labour Inclusion campaigns” in collab- oration with Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos (NPH)30 a charitable organisation that has provided a home for thousands of orphans and abandoned children since 1954. Currently there are NPH homes in nine Latin American countries and the Caribbean.
• The first campaign provided three months of profes- sional training to six young people. Two of them were hired as full-time employees.
• The second campaign involved training with
the Dominican Navy on relevant IMO Conventions, including the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for seafarers (STCW). All four trainees were hired
on board our cruise vessel MSC Preziosa.
Currently there are five more NPH graduates taking the IMO courses who will have the possibility to work for MSC Cruises.

SHIP RECYCLING
The ship recycling industry actively supports many developing countries’ economies and promotes the circular economy, as materials used to build ships, especially steel, are recycled and may be used to manufacture new products.
Yet poor working and environmental conditions still prevail in some recycling yards due to challenging domestic governance and protection gaps. Additionally, the IMO Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (IMO HKC) “aimed at ensuring that ships, when being recycled after reaching the end of their operational lives, do not pose any unnecessary risk to human health and safety or to the environment31”, has not yet entered into force.
At present, the IMO HKC is considered to be the only international policy instrument that can be fully imple- mented, when it comes to vessels’ sustainable recycling processes. It covers the entire lifecycle of the ship as it provides appropriate recycling standards from the design, construction, operation to the preparation of ships to the end of their operational cycle. This facilitates safe and environmentally sound recycling of the vessel. Furthermore, it establishes appropriate enforcement mechanisms for ship recycling, including certification and reporting requirements.
Consistent with the relevant IMO implementing resolution, MSC has already integrated the applicable requirements and technical standards of the IMO HKC in its Ship Recycling Policy (available on www.msc. com/ship-recycling). MSC sales contracts impose on the buyer or yard to undertake safe and environmen- tally sound recycling as per IMO HKC standards. The contracts also require use of approved ship recycling facilities, as demonstrated by certifications under the standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and by recognised Classification Societies. In this respect, our policy specifies that yards
must be certified for OHSAS 18001 (Health and Safety), ISO 30000 (ship recycling management, which includes provision of safe working conditions for workers) and compliant with International Labour Organization (ILO) standards and requirements for health and safety. Further, training must be provided for workers, for example on the handling of dangerous materials, and wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be mandatory.
To address risks of environmental contamination, shipyards engaged in recycling of MSC ships must be certified according to ISO 14001 standards. This requires shipyards to have, for example, concrete flooring to prevent soil and ground pollution. Effective draining systems must be in place as well as facilities for safe removal, handling, transport, and removal of hazard- ous waste.
As part of our due diligence efforts, we also conduct regular visits to the approved recycling yards, either with our internal auditors or with external parties to monitor compliance with environmental, health and safety, labour conditions and human rights, anti-corrup- tion, and downstream facilities for waste management and disposal. Any breach of our compliance framework observed during our visits is reported to the recycling yard management for immediate corrective action. MSC ensures also that a specialised company monitors and conducts surveys of its main suppliers’ facilities and ship repair yards where the majority of its vessels go for repairs. All findings are communicated for immedi- ate corrective action where required. To further improve safety and reduce any risk on board when dealing with, for example, any potential asbestos containing compound, each vessel has been supplied with a safety kit.

EU Ship Recycling Regulation (EUSRR)
Effective as of 31st December 2018, the European Union Ship Recycling Regulation (EUSRR) requires mandatory carriage of an Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM) by all new vessels flying European Union member flags. All existing EU flag vessels and non-EU flag vessels calling at EU ports will also be required to carry an approved IHM by 31st December 2020 at the latest. This regulation reflects main provisions as set forth by the IMO HKC and requires ships flying an EU flag to be recycled only at EU recognised ship recycling yards. To date, very few yards outside EU have been included in the list. MSC supports and complies with the EU Regulation on Ship Recycling Regulations, where applicable.
Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHMs)
MSC is preparing fleet-wide Inventories of Hazardous Materials (IHMs) as per the EU SRR and following the requirements of IMO HKC. This aims to further minimise human risks, including occupational exposure to toxic substances and potential adverse health and safety and environmental impacts on land, workers, and local communities in the long term.
The IHMs serve to ensure correct handling of hazard- ous materials, and to regulate waste management to prevent exposure of crew to hazardous materials on board ships and at the recycling phase of the vessel. In 2015, MSC developed an implementation plan to ensure that by 2020, the deadline specified by the IMO, each MSC vessel will have an IHM. This inventory will be maintained and updated throughout the operational life of the ship, with certification issued by a classifi- cation society to confirm compliance with applicable requirements.
Once compliance has been achieved, regular checks will be undertaken to ensure that IHMs are maintained, current, and accurate.
  MSC VISIT TO ALANG32 SHIP RECYCLING FACILITIES
MSC has been periodically visiting the ship recycling facilities at Alang, India independently and as part of an EU delegation. Improvements implemented at various yards have been commended. This progress reflects the fact that now there are over 70 ship recycling yards with an IMO HKC compliance certificate issued by classification societies. Besides the improvements in the recycling process, advances made in the areas of health, downstream waste management, worker train- ing, housing facilities, and health centres are expected to continue.
32 Alang is a town on the west coast of India which has a large share of ship recycling business. The recycling business provides employment to over 55000 people and accounts for turnover of approx. one billion USD each year.

WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT
   The shipping sector is a traditionally male-orient- ed industry. The level of women participation is an estimated 2% and patterns of job segregation as well as gender stereotyping still exist. In the maritime industry, over 76% of the female workforce operates at admin- istrative, junior, and professional positions, with only 0.17% of women enjoying an executive leadership role. Nevertheless, an increasing number of women are enter- ing the shipping industry in all roles, including seafaring and operations, chartering, insurance, and law.33
MSC is actively working to promote maritime careers for women as well as female employees to senior positions. Efforts include internal mobility programmes and train- ing to increase their interest in pursuing a career in our sector therefore retaining female talent. in 2018, 35% of the promotions in MSC were given to female employees and 29% of internal mobility roles were given to women. Furthermore, in collaboration with our SAP34 team based at Headquarters and our Agencies worldwide, we promoted training to female employees working in the finance and accounting departments. Those roles are extremely important as employees supervise a sophisti- cated process to ensure correct reporting to authorities, as well as respecting the obligations of MSC vendors providing almost real-time monitoring of costs and cashflow worldwide.

In 2018, we also partnered with a non-profit organisa- tion offering expert free and confidential support to our HQ employees relating to health, work, finance, family, social insurance, and personnel issues in order to ensure their continued well-being and work/life balance.
Additionally, we enhanced our investments in programmes to improve the technical skills and exper- tise of our employees all around the world. One of our key global developmental initiatives is the MSC Academy, managed and implemented by the MSC Global Human Resources Department. This opportunity is offered to a pool of selected high potential employees with the aim of supporting their growth, being exposed to new networks increasing their knowledge of the business and our culture as well as our Sustainability approach. The project includes a People Management Training Programme which takes place both remotely and face-to-face to strengthen soft skills as well as the Shipping Training Programme for Africa (STPA) target- ing employees working in our Agencies in the African Continent.
Global HR Team, Geneva Headquarters
Despite the enhancement of initiatives and programmes, challenges still remain, especially at the local level, where other elements such as cultural factors and social challenges, further prevent advancement in reaching gender equality. In this regard, as in the past years, we remain focussed on the following strategic areas:
• promotion of access to employment opportunities targeting local women in challenging countries
• vocational training on specific shipping-related
services/operations to improve soft and technical
skills required to work in our sector
• reduction of barriers to women’s empowerment.
Initiatives included creation of breastfeeding rooms, flexible working hours, facilities for women, training on healthy nutrition practices, and mentoring.
Specific case studies on the above were reported in our 2016 and 2017 Sustainability reports. In 2018, the Global HR Department also launched the global data collection of a number of “Social Performance Indicators”, which includes gender indicators and gender disaggregated data. The SPIs also have a specific focus on vulnerable categories of workers such as women and migrant workers, in line with relevant GRI standards, UN Guidance tools and key areas we promote as part of our broader sustainability strategy.

 CASE STUDY
MSC FOR THE SCHOOL PROJECT
MSC SHIPMANAGEMENT, SORRENTO, ITALY
“MSC for the School” was launched by MSC Shipmanagement Sorrento in 2017, in collaboration with the Nautical Technical Institute “Nino Bixio” in Sorrento, Italy. This gives the opportunity every year to five of the best male and female students from the deck depart- ment and five from the engine department to get direct exposure to the merchant shipping reality. Students are shortlisted not only on the basis of their school records but also as identified potential candidates to work onboard MSC cargo ships. In 2018, students were given the opportunity to visit MSC offices in Shanghai and the Yangshan Terminal, one of the largest and busiest termi- nals in the world. The ten-days experience included full immersion in the world of logistics, shipbuilding, port activities, documentation, compliance with regulations and certification as well as covering life on board.
In 2017, students visited MSC offices in Singapore and in 2019 the plan is to invite them to our offices in Panama. MSC Shipmanagement Sorrento’s leadership team also provides regular courses on opportunities in the maritime sector, promoting seafaring as a career.
In the past, MSC Shipmanagement Sorrento has often employed women on container vessels as Radio Officers. With the advent of more sophisticated electronic equipment, as GMDSS, few women are employed as navigational officers whereas more women are employed on MSC Cruises, always as navigational officers and as Chief Officers. Ashore, in the crewing and technical department several women are employed. Approximately 12% of employees in this division are women, some of them with a naval architecture background have become managers and are responsi- ble for new important projects.

 SUPPORTING HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) “the growing scale, complexity and impact of humanitarian crises around the world threaten decades of peace- building and development efforts.”35. Today, major humanitarian crises are exacerbated by geopolitical challenges, conflicts, and other factors such as climate change, requiring enhanced collaboration and concert- ed efforts from different actors to ensure timely delivery
of emergency relief to affected populations. The private sector’s expertise and financial contributions as well as innovative technologies are further helping to build a more inclusive and diverse humanitarian relief system, contributing to address related humanitarian needs and risk management issues on the ground in collab- oration with key local and international humanitarian stakeholders.

MSC’S ENGAGEMENT IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION
“Effective logistics systems are central to deliver emergency relief (...), to “deliver the right supplies, in good condition and the quantities requested, in the right places at the time they are needed.”36 In this respect, in recent years, MSC has further increased its support to humanitarian assistance by providing not only in-kind contributions, but also assets, services, and business expertise providing effective and efficient disaster response in partnership with local authorities as well as the broad UN system. Our efforts helped to leverage existing networks and fill crucial logistics gaps in a number of countries.
Additionally, MSC supports intergovernmental organ- isations and international aid groups by providing containers, as well as space on ships for food imports, as part of the overall relief efforts. As an illustration, in
2018 CARGO DIVISION CONTRIBUTION TO EMERGENCY AND RELIEF*
2017, in cooperation with the New York State Governor and the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), MSC and MSC Cruises joined efforts to provide logistics support to Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Dominica, St Maarten and Tortola, which were severely impacted by the Hurricane Maria, a Category 5 hurricane. Furthermore, hundreds of containers were donated to various charity organisations across the USA. At the time we are writing this report, MSC is also actively participating in the humanitarian relief and recovery efforts in Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands, which have been affected by the Hurricane Dorian. Our contri- bution includes supporting any kind of service providers to deliver the needed supplies and goods to the Islands even in absence of an operating terminal. This is helping local stakeholders and local communities to effectively address shortage of basic necessities, including the high demand for emergency shelters and housing that can only be transported via containers.
Some examples of other actions taken by MSC Agencies in 2018 are summarised in the below table.

SUPPORTING MERCY SHIPS
IN ADDRESSING GAPS IN HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND SURGERY SKILLS
IN AFRICA
Throughout 2018, MSC continued to support Mercy Ships, a global charity, which deploys hospital ships to some of the poorest countries in the world, deliver- ing free, vital healthcare to people in desperate need. MSC’s contributions include logistics services and free transportation of medical equipment in support of the activities carried out in Douala, Cameroon, and Conakry, Guinea.
According to the Lancet Commission‘s 2015 report entitled “2015 Global Surgery 2030: evidence and solutions for achieving health, welfare, and economic development”37 more than 18 million people die every year due to lack of timely surgical care, especially
in developing countries and more specifically in Sub-Saharan Africa. The report also states that quality, accessible, affordable, and universal essential surgical services are essential to decrease mortality and morbidity ratios across the world. Reducing healthcare gaps and health inequality promote gender equality and non-discrimination practices, increase economic growth, and support infrastructure development.
In line with the above, Mercy Ships does not only significantly contribute to the progressive realisation of the Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), but also helps realise a number of interrelated Global Goals. Indeed, their volunteers ensure quality surgical care to marginalised and the most vulnerable people, and in some cases, mitigate the impact of mass casualities by maintaining deliv- ery of health services in fragile environments or in areas affected by conflicts. In addition to completing thousands of urgent operations on board its ‘state- of-the-art’ floating hospital, the Africa Mercy; Mercy Ships doubles its impact in the long term by working closely with host nations to improve the way health- care is delivered across the country. In this respect, volunteers also train and mentor local medical staff and healthcare professionals as well as provide support in renovating hospital and clinics, in partnerships with local authorities.

VOLUNTEER CREW
In 2018, over 1,200 volunteer crew, from 56 different nations served on board the Africa Mercy with up to 400 individual volunteers at work on the ship at any one time. Volunteers serving with Mercy Ships contribute monthly crew fees and raise their own finances to live and work on board. This means that funding received is complemented by contributed services and gifts-in-kind, enabling Mercy Ships to deliver medical and development services at a fraction of the traditional cost. In 2018, 500 African nationals served onboard as “DayCrew”.

ABOUT THE COLLABORATION WITH THE ABF
MSC and the Andrea Bocelli Foundation officially launched their partnership in December 2017, during the christening of MSC SEASIDE in Miami. Believing that music can have a powerful and universal sense of communication, Maestro Bocelli and MSC Cruises invited thirty children from Haiti on board, to join the choir “The Voices of Haiti” during the ceremony. This aimed to further promote and raise awareness of the critical challenges affecting Haiti.
Founded in 2011 by Italian vocal maestro Andrea Bocelli, the Foundation aims to empower people and communities experiencing poverty and exclusion by helping reduce the barriers that prevent them enjoying their basic human rights and expressing their full potential.

   HAITI: COUNTRY PROFILE38
Haiti is one of the least developed countries in the world, with high mortality and poverty rates:
• 80% of the population lives with less than
1 dollar per day
• Average life expectancy does not exceed
55 years
• 56% of the population suffers from malnutrition
• 1 out of 3 children dies of hunger or
preventable diseases before the age of 5
• 1 out of 2 children lacks education
• Only 67% of children aged between 6 and
12 years attend school
• Only 30% of children attending primary school
complete the 5 years education cycle envisaged
• 70% of the population does not have
an occupation
• Infrastructures, sewage systems, water
distribution, and electrical systems are either absent or severely lagging behind.
In January 2010, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake left 260,000 dead, 300,000 injured and one million homeless. The country is still in an emergency phase and trying to recover from the disaster, which was also exacerbated by cholera chikungunya and two hurricanes.

A WORD FROM OUR PRESIDENT & CEO
WHEREVER WE OPERATE, ON LAND OR AT SEA, OUR PEOPLE REMAIN OUR GREATEST ASSET.
In 2017, MSC successfully maintained its leadership position in the global economy, despite slow trade growth and high operating costs that have created uncertainty within the international container shipping sector. Achieving such economic performance did not come without challenges at all levels. Yet, we pursued our goals by remaining true to our roots and our core family values, promoting a sustainable business model that goes far beyond a “business as usual” approach. Regardless of the challenges and transformation we might face in today’s business world, our approach does not and will not change: we have a genuine passion for the sea, an unparalleled nautical heritage and a strong commitment to our employees and communities. Wherever we operate, in both developed and develop- ing countries, both on land or at sea, our people remain our greatest asset. Our strategies focus on building and maintaining strong and reliable relationships with our stakeholders, communities and business partners as well as securing continuity and long-term employ- ment opportunities for our employees. We do this while making significant investments in low-carbon technol- ogies and promoting integrity and ethical practices through capacity-building efforts and training.
In our 2017 Sustainability Report, we further illus- trate how all these elements are an integral part of our decision-making process and therefore embedded in MSC’s four fundamental sustainability pillars: the promo- tion of social inclusion and a shared value approach, our respect and care for the environment, our continuous focus on occupational health and safety and our strong commitment to promoting respect for internationally recognised human rights principles and standards.
In addition, we have demonstrated how these pillars are strictly linked to our support towards the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact and our contribution in joining global efforts for the progressive realisation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet, above all, we have acknowledged the engagement and dedication of our 70,000 employees who bring to life our sustainability approach and our Group family values. This is what makes us so successful today and what, at the same time, creates not only countless opportunities but also great responsibilities.
We are running our activities and operations at a time of increasing environmental policies and regulations, such as the 2020 global cap on sulphur content in marine fuel oil, which our technical teams started to prepare for in 2013. We should not forget that reaching these ambitious environmental goals and targets represents a financial commitment of billions of dollars. In this respect, we continue to invest in retrofitting, the optimi- sation of bulbous bow and propellers, ballast water management, new build programs and latest availa- ble technologies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and sulphur oxide emissions. By doing this, in 2017, we proudly achieved an 11% reduction in CO2 per tons of cargo moved on a per mile basis, compared to 2015. However, it is important to acknowledge that our tremendous progress in energy and operational effic- iency is also achieved thanks to the daily efforts and outstanding expertise of our dedicated teams working at the Headquarters, in our technical offices and MSC’s Agencies worldwide.
So, we continue to rely on governments to provide clar- ity with practical and meaningful legislation, regulation

and standards that take into account real economy imperatives, financial implications and operational challenges. This can certainly contribute to reducing barriers and promoting the respect for human dignity and decent long-term working conditions for all employ- ees as well as the next generations of employees, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Similarly, we continue to rely on our stakehold- ers to further engage in promoting safety at sea and support our ongoing efforts to prevent potential risks to the health and safety of crew members as well as environmental accidents. We are very active in indus- try associations and forums to highlight our concerns to our customers. We believe that more accuracy and transparency is needed. It is imperative that shipping companies are well informed on what is being transport- ed in containers in order to safely manage dangerous or potentially dangerous cargoes. The public may assume the shipping line is at fault – it is our logo on the ship – but many of the tragedies that occur in our sector are down to incorrectly declared cargo. And where there have been accidents at sea, we have always taken all necessary actions and moved promptly to rectify the
situation to limit environmental damage and protect lives. No amount of technological progress or digitalisa- tion, it seems, can help fix this relatively simple problem in our industry.
I sincerely hope that sharing more about these topics and challenges with our customers, employees, suppli- ers and our wide range of stakeholders will deepen our strategic partnerships and strengthen our concert- ed actions to advance social and environmental performance.
We look forward to continuing to join forces to foster a sustainable and responsible approach to doing business throughout our sector and beyond.

                                                                                                                                                  CONTRIBUTING TO THE SUSTAINABLE OCEAN ECONOMY
THE MSC GROUP
Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and privately-owned, the
MSC Group is a recognised world leader in the maritime sector, serving millions of customers around the globe. Our innovative, flexible and unique approach to shipping has led to impressive growth in terms of volume and fleet capacity. This has enabled us to diversify our portfolio of activities, from a one-vessel operation in 1970 to a successful and sustainable global business today.
 Today, the MSC Group encompasses a Cargo Division with MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), MEDLOG, and a Passenger Division with MSC Cruises and Mediterranean passenger ferries, Grandi Navi Veloci (GNV) and SNAV (Società Navigazione Alta Velocità).
Through our wide range of companies, we contribute to connecting people and countries by offering a global integrated and holistic network of transportation and logistics solutions by land and sea. We are engaged in the promotion and development of key ocean industries, such as maritime transport and tourism, which are essen- tial for fostering economic growth and social welfare. We have built our long-standing reputation with our customers and stakeholders by providing sustainable and resilient transportation services and infrastructure, while promoting inclusive and lasting social benefits wherever we operate.
We significantly contribute, in a responsible way, to the growth of shipping-related services, operations and business activities, in both developed and developing countries. Additionally, we facilitate the development of international trade and contribute to fostering countries’ competitiveness by providing access to our global network. Being a family-owned business, the companies of the MSC Group are guided by common Group values and a long-term vision promoting fair business practices and

respect for human rights and environmental standards at an international level.
The Cargo and Passenger Divisions have different materi- ality and due diligence assessments, mainly due to the diversity of their respective activities, missions and business strategies. For instance, the relevance of internal and exter- nal factors and their prioritisation in decision-making, risk management and risk assessment processes vary. These factors include the international standards and regulations that each division is assumed to comply with, specific stakeholders’ interests and concerns, broader social expectations and the capacity to exercise influence on upstream (such as the supply chain) and downstream (such as customers) entities.
In this respect, this report intends to cover the MSC Group Cargo Division, highlighting progress made towards the implementation of the United Nations (UN) principles-based approach and the promotion of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in line with the company’s commitment to the United Nations Global Compact and the Global Report Initiative (GRI) standards.
Some initiatives are described as Group initiatives when core topics have relevance for both Divisions and promote a strategic common approach to protecting and supporting human rights and our strong commitment to environmental stewardship.

ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE
CARGO DIVISION
MSC is a transportation service provider carrying physi- cal commodities from one point in the world to another. The company operates a fleet of 510 vessels, calling at 500 ports. Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, MSC has 480 offices in 155 countries and employs 47,000 people for its shipboard and ashore activities. Shipboard operations are largely monitored by third parties due to certification requirements and routine inspections set out by local port authorities and other entities. MSC local agencies are responsible for ashore activities.
MSC, through its Terminal Investment Limited (TiL) subsidiary, has interests in 54 terminals within 29 countries across five continents. TiL invests in, devel- ops and manages container terminals in strategic global locations, providing essential infrastructure for international trade.
MSC’s logistics arm, MEDLOG, offers a variety of ser- vices to customers in over 50 locations around the world. These services include transportation by road, rail and barge, off-dock storage, container maintenance & repairs (M&R), warehousing & distribution, project cargo and reefer container services. MEDLOG direct- ly employs more than 6,000 employees and generates approximately 2,000 indirect jobs around the world. The technical management of MSC vessels and crews is handled by MSC Shipmanagement Technical offices, located in Limassol, Cyprus and Sorrento, Italy respectively.
PASSENGER DIVISION
The MSC Group’s Passenger Division is comprised of cruise and ferry businesses.
MSC Cruises is the world’s largest privately owned cruise company and the number one cruise line in Europe, South America, South Africa and the Gulf Region. A game-changer in the world of cruising, the company has achieved 800% growth in its first ten years by building one of the youngest cruise sea fleets and a global reputation in the industry. The MSC Cruises fleet is currently made up of 15 ultra-modern, highly innova- tive and elegantly designed ships that welcome around two million guests per year.
With an ambitious investment plan of EUR€11.6 billion, the MSC Cruises fleet is set to expand to 25 mega-cruise ships by 2026. It has recently designed six new ship class prototypes that will push the boundaries of naval architecture and design. MSC Cruises’ services are sold across the globe through a distribution network in 70 countries. The company employs over 23,500 people worldwide, both ashore and on board its ships.
In addition to ocean cruises, the MSC Group’s Passenger Division includes GNV and SNAV, two leading ferry companies that connect a large number of ports in the Mediterranean Sea all year round.

PROMOTING SDGs AND SUSTAINABILITY CULTURE
MSC is strongly committed to achieving economic perfor- mance while promoting ethical business throughout its value and supply chains. For this reason, environmen- tal and social considerations are equally important to us and embedded in our decision-making process and business models. We work responsibly, implementing sustainable practices, procedures and policies based on good corporate governance, integrity and care for the environment. These are reflected in the way we take decisions, interact with one another and behave with our customers and stakeholders. Since the signing of the UN Global Compact in 2016, we have increased efforts at Group level to further promote our responsi- ble approach to business throughout our organisation and in our day-to-day operations, in line with the Ten Principles of the United Nations. In addition, we have reinforced the way we mainstream our Group values and sustainability into our internal and external communica- tions by ensuring a cross-departmental collaboration at HQ level between the Marketing and Communications Departments of both MSC and MSC Cruises.
A COMMUNICATION TOOL
Our Sustainability Report aims to describe our best practices as well as challenges related to the implemen- tation of the United Nations’ Ten Principles approach and the SDGs. We also wish to raise awareness of the SDGs among our employees and stakeholders, and facilitate the understanding of our approach to sustainability. Significant case studies highlighted in our reports will be regularly updated by our local agencies via the MSC official website to show that continuity is an integral part of our business model, and to enable our employees and stakeholders to follow our progress with regards to our activities and broader sustainability-related initiatives.
SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE
Sustainability Steering Committee
In 2017, MSC enhanced the role and structure of its Sustainability Steering Committee.
Led by the Aponte family and executives from the Headquarters in Geneva, the Committee is respons- ible for providing strategic guidance on matters such as environmental protection, occupational health & safety, sustainable development, human rights and social welfare.
One of the key strategic decisions taken by the Committee is to strengthen the ongoing harmonisation efforts in order to better monitor compliance with our ethical and good governance practices throughout our value and supply chains. To do so, we have planned to further improve internal processes and cross-transver- sal cooperation among relevant departments and local agencies. This will contribute to enhance an organisa- tion-wide coordination process led by the Headquarters, while maintaining local specificities and further refining business activities and operational strategic actions to advance specific goals. The newly established Global Human Resources Department will also play a crucial role in this respect.
Sustainability Working Groups
To effectively mobilise all departments in implement- ing approved strategies, in 2018 we plan to create ad hoc Sustainability Supporting HQ Working Groups composed of in-house subject matter experts who will be responsible for supporting the integration of sustain- ability into the daily work of the MSC value chain. They will also underpin the ongoing efforts at HQ level to monitor progress and track sustainability performance in strategic priority areas.

SHARED VALUE APPROACH
MSC’s decision-making process and shared value approach are both based on a strategic framework consisting of four main pillars: social inclusion, protec- tion of the environment, occupational health & safety, business ethics and protection of human rights. Within this framework, in 2017 we began to assess existing practices, policies and gaps relating to each of those pillars against a number of criteria to better identi- fy our material topics and enhance our sustainability strategy on key strategic areas.
MSC’s business model promotes social inclusiveness in line with SDGs 1, 2, 3, 8 and 10. We aim to contrib- ute to long-term socio-economic growth in the countries where we operate through community involvement and local recruitment, especially in developing countries. Our massive investments also focus on the latest environ- mentally friendly cooling technology such as refrigerated containers, depots and warehouses. This helps to reduc- ing food losses, ensuring quality food, encouraging responsible consumption in line with SDG 12 and enabling small farmers to enter global food markets. We seek to improve inland connectivity, including in landlocked countries, by investing in cross-border transport solutions, logistics services, storage facilities and trans- port infrastructure, in partnership with public and private stakeholders. In line with our people-centred approach, our training programmes are an essential element of our investment strategy, as illustrated by the recently approved MSC Academy project to be launched in 2018. This will promote the alignment between business goals and people-related objectives by focusing on key areas such as people development, learning programmes and internal mobility. The departments of MSC HQ have also enhanced their collaboration to improve and harmonise existing practices and procedures throughout the organ- isation. The global harmonisation process is intended to assist our subsidiaries and branch offices worldwide to further align their ongoing strategies and country-specific or region-specific corporate social initiatives with the company’s overall sustainability strategy promoted at the HQ level.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
One of our main material topics is and will remain our strong commitment to preserving the environment and biodiversity, in accordance with SDGs 7, 12, 13,14 and 15. Our extensive investments in the latest available low-carbon technologies, energy efficiency practices and operational efficiency systems are regularly assessed to ensure that they meet current and future international regulations. In line with SDG 17, we are actively involved in the Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG) and we are a founding member of the Global Industry Alliance (GIA), which is supported by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and promotes energy efficiency and low-carbon maritime transport systems. In addition, MSC is part of the board of the World Shipping Council (WSC), whose goal is to provide a coordinated voice for the liner shipping industry on matters such as these.
PARTNERING
FOR WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AND MARINE BIODIVERSITY
Our constant efforts to minimise our environmental impact and carbon footprint include our participation in sever- al local and international initiatives and partnerships to promote the protection of wildlife and marine biodiversity. In 2017, MSC reiterated its strong commitment to the United for Wildlife Buckingham Palace Declaration, which aims to combat the illegal trade in endangered animals by breaking the transportation link between suppliers and buyers.

 Marevivo
We have also further strengthened our long-term partnership with Marevivo, an Italian marine conserv- ation association founded in 1985 that works worldwide, supported by a scientific commission, legal commission, territorial delegations, a diving division and an extensive network of volunteers and members. Recently, Marevivo’s advocacy efforts led to the Italian government’s decision to pass legislation banning microplastics from cosmetics by 2020 and removing plastics from cotton swabs by 2019. Since 2015, MSC Cruises and Marevivo have joined forces to increase environmental awareness among young people. Educational programmes include topics such as marine biodiversity, sustainable development and restoration of marine protected areas, as well as combatting pollution and illegal fishing.
In 2017 Marevivo and MSC worked on three projects:
• The‘GuardianDolphins’youthprogrammeisaniniti- ative implemented in primary schools on ten Italian islands, which aims at fostering greater aware- ness about the conservation of marine resources. Key impact: 700 students; 60 teachers, operators and experts; 19 schools; 1,400 adults in ten minor Italian
islands (Eolie, Egadi, La Maddalena, Palau)
• Nauticinblu, an educational programme targeting future seafarers focused on the incorporation of environmental conservation and marine sustain- ability in Italian naval academies’ curricula. Key impact: three maritime academies: San Giorgio in Genoa, Volterra-Elia in Ancona and Nino Bixio in
Sorrento; 210 students (70 per institute), 30 teachers.
• #Mybluewave Experience on sustainable develop- ment. This project includes on-board activities during cruises, ranging from “edutainment” games to learn- ing moments and species-sighting activities to educate children about the environment in which cruise ships sail. Key impact: in 2017, 200,000 children participated in the activities dedicated to the sea on board MSC Cruises’
ships.

 HEALTH
AND SAFETY
MSC considers occupational health and safety a funda- mental material topic. In this respect, we promote personal, environmental and navigational safety in line with SDGs 3, 8 and 14, applicable international quality shipping regulations and other relevant international instruments. One more area of concern relates to proper cargo-handling and management.
In the last ten years, we have increased our offer of training programmes in soft and technical skills to further promote a culture of safety among our crew members and ensure rapid response capabilities in case of emergencies and unexpected events, especially natural disasters.
Our ship recycling practice is another important area of emphasis for MSC, as it is strictly related to labour standards, environmental protection and human rights, in accordance with SDGs 8 and 12. We strive to ensure that the recycling of materials and other ship compo- nents is performed at yards without any unnecessary risk to human health, safety or the environment. Our responsible practices are fully supported by MSC top management and only recycling yards with IMO HKC standards, ISO 14001 (environment), ISO 30001 (ship recycling management) and OSHAS 18001 (Health & Safety) standards are selected for recycling at the end of the useful life of a ship.
BUSINESS ETHICS
AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
Finally, it is MSC’s objective to conduct its business activities in a responsible and ethical manner. We support the UN Global Compact’s principles-based approach in the areas of human rights, labour, environ- ment and anti-corruption, promoting a culture of integrity throughout the organisation and within our sphere of influence.
Furthermore, in accordance with SDG 16, we actively engage with other companies and international stake- holders to advance collective actions aimed at fighting bribery and corruption. We also participate in the discus- sions of the International Chamber of Commerce Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy (BASCAP).
As part of our commitment to the protection of human rights, MSC strives to provide its employees with a safe working environment, offering stable financial revenues through long-term career paths. In line with SDGs 1, 5 and 10, MSC also focuses on women’s empowerment by promoting the elimination of gender disparities in employment, both on board and offshore, and by invest- ing in technical and managerial training for women. We promote local recruitment wherever we operate, yet our commitment to bringing value to local commun- ities goes far beyond compliance. Following SDGs 1, 2, 3 and 16, we seek to contribute to peace-building efforts deployed by international actors on the ground, by contributing to humanitarian relief actions, including for victims of natural disasters. Whenever possible, we transport emergency humanitarian aid cargoes to areas of conflict, within the framework of international regula- tions and international humanitarian laws.

ADAPTING BUSINESS STRATEGIES TO GLOBAL SOCIAL TRENDS
Being a global player in the international shipping sector with 70,000 employees and operations all over the world, we are committed to ensuring a positive social impact wherever we operate, while promoting the sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources.
In all our strategies and business models, we strive to create conditions for increased prosperity and wealth both on land and at sea, despite the challenges of a highly competitive market. Yet, new developments currently affecting transport and trade are influencing sustainability considerations in our sector, and freight transport systems and patterns in general. Therefore, for us, understanding ongoing as well as future global and local challenges is a must in today’s changing world. We are proud to continuously seek to transform those challenges into opportunities through our inclusive, sustainable and long-term investment strategies. In this respect, we continue to promote local recruitment, multi-cultural working opportunities and the develop- ment of ocean-based and shipping-related industries all over the world. As a global service provider, we care about our customers and their cargo. This means that we do not forget that our customers and business partners also have responsibilities towards their own customers and consumers.
Our transportation solutions are commercially viable, environmentally friendly and comply with the highest health and safety standards. We work in partnership with governments, business partners and other relevant stakeholders to increase local trade competitiveness and countries’ ability to
effectively integrate and benefit from global supply chains. We are therefore promoting the realisation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and its wide range of interrelated SDGs, by building solid, enduring partnerships with all of our customers and stakeholders. For MSC, loyalty and continuity, together with our long-term financial investments and invest- ment in people, are essential elements to achieve sustainable development.
CREATING JOBS FOR
A FAST-GROWING POPULATION
The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) 2017 Revision of World Population Prospects foresees a dramatic increase of world popula- tion from today’s 7.6 billion to 8.6 billion in 2030. This trend is expected to bring new challenges with regards to domestic labour markets, levels of inequality and supply chains, on both a local and global scale. Those challenges might be exacerbated in developing and least developed countries, if economic growth will not create sufficient jobs to match the demand of a young popula- tion and a growing labour force. In this respect, our approach will continue to focus on supporting govern- ments to address poverty and unemployment rates through the promotion of decent work opportunities for all segment of the population, without discrimination. We will also further invest in programmes and training aimed at improving the soft and technical skills of our employees all around the world, to enhance our contri- bution to inclusive capacity-building efforts.

A GLOBAL BUSINESS WITH A LOCAL APPROACH
We pride ourselves on our ability to adapt business solutions to the local needs of communities, national authorities and other stakeholders. With 480 offices across 155 countries, our customers can rely on our in-depth understanding of the local markets, the dynam- ics of specific trades and any factors affecting the transit of cargoes. Our approach supports our focus on invest- ing responsibly in each country of operation, including in least developing countries and emerging markets, promoting business models, services and operational activities tailored to ongoing and future local and global challenges. These include today’s digital and technologi- cal developments and their impact on transforming jobs and trade patterns.
We must acknowledge that globalisation and digital- isation have played a role in modifying the social
expectations of workers as well as the way we benefit from the use of new technologies. In this respect, in line with our social inclusive approach, our investment in innovation promotes the safety and expertise of our employees, not their replacement. We continuously encourage e-learning, especially among women, and support employee mobility and the diversification of career paths. While digital connectivity can provide new opportunities for countries to increase domestic growth and enter the global economy, traditional trade costs related to physical connectivity can still represent a significant barrier for the delivering of goods. This is why our strategic focus will also remain on increasing our global logistics network and promoting connec- tivity among populations and countries in line with national strategies and country-specific needs.

    20 SOCIAL INCLUSIVE APPROACH
MSC continues to support a holistic and long-term social inclusive approach within the African continent. Since the launch of our first route between the Mediterranean and East Africa in 1971, we have invested extensively in local recruitment, transport services and infrastructure to bring inclusive economic and social development and global trade opportunities to local players. Today, our local MSC agencies serve 40 African countries, helping to enhance their role and potential in the global econo- my. Our liner services, calling at 60 ports every week and at port terminals in Togo, Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria and Morocco, ensure connections between Africa and the rest of the world. We also invest and manage state-of- the-art terminals, which, working in collaboration with our logistics teams, can take any cargo to any location. Our overall market share, currently at around 21%, continues to grow significantly year on year, showing our full support for the development of the continent’s future.

 Facilitating maritime trade
to tackle food insecurity
The MSC’s strategic choice to invest in Africa’s devel- opment aligns with the increasing commitment of most African countries to foster trade exchanges within the continent and beyond, also through the promotion of the maritime economy. In particular, we appreciate the recent efforts put forward of several African countries that led to the adoption in 2016 of the Charte de Lomé and the expected implementation of a Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA).
The benefits of a free and efficient flow of goods and trade extend far beyond the ships and ports themselves. An effective interface between them can improve the lives of people everywhere, especially in the context
of sustainable development. Positive trends, such as the development of local industries and the agricul- ture sector, can certainly support Africa’s growth in the long term. In this respect, there is no doubt that the private sector, and especially the shipping sector and its supply chain, has an important role to play in addressing some of the obstacles that prevent local African products from reaching more lucrative global markets or meeting food insecurity challenges. MSC will therefore enhance its network of storage facilities, further increase its offer of an integrated network of inland and cross-border transportation solutions and support cold chain development throughout the conti- nent, in line with its commitment to the promotion of the SDGs.

22 SOCIAL INCLUSIVE APPROACH

   Investing in infrastructure
to improve connections
West African ports are currently enjoying an ongoing positive trend of expansion, modernisation and intermodal transportation linkages. We observe a continuing rise in infrastructure investment from both the private and public sectors to link all capitals by road, high-speed rail and air. This constitutes a positive outlook for growth, as infra- structural development is essential for enhancing African countries’ competitiveness, facilitating trade and achiev- ing sustainable development.
Our investments will continue to focus on terminals and related infrastructure, as well as on developing a sustainable and integrated transport network, including in landlocked countries (LLCs). This will further facilitate the transport of goods and services across and between African countries, including between urban and rural/ remote areas, as well as from the African continent to the global market. As an illustration, in 2018 we plan to launch in Le Havre ro-ro operations from Europe to West Africa, which will complement our existing dedicated contain- er services.
Engaging stakeholders to overcome
common challenges
The African Union launched a depth transformation across the continent to further promote local produc- tivity and long-term economic growth. We observe a new paradigm shift that encourages the participation of the private sector in strategic plans to foster sustainable development in Africa. To this end, structural changes have been considered as necessary and the dialogue between the public and private sectors has been enhanced and revitalised to ensure that local needs, as well as ongoing and future global challenges and broad development issues facing African countries, are taken into account in business models. In this respect,
in recent years we have reinforced our commitment to Africa through dialogue and partnerships with key stakeholders at a national and international level. Nevertheless, challenges for the business communi- ty remain, as structural projects, such as infrastructure projects, and private investments need to be support- ed by key reforms on good governance and innovative financial guarantees to become sustainable in the long term. Yet, we are confident that ongoing global efforts and initiatives will continue to address current barriers to further investments from the private sector. These initiatives include the G20 Compact with Africa, which is supported by African governments, the internation- al community and Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs).

 CASE STUDY
LANDLOCKED COUNTRIES
                UNLOCKING THE GROWTH POTENTIAL
In the past 45 years, MSC’s logistics arm, MEDLOG, through its subsidiaries, has invested heavily in the development of inland infrastructures and the creation of corridors by using and improving existing logistics resources all around the globe.
As an illustration, thanks to more than 550 dedicated trucks, about 50 lifting equipment units, 15 warehouses and a presence in 23 African countries, MEDLOG has built up an integrated network of road and rail solutions to connect landlocked countries (LLCs) and remote areas to ports. The services provided have helped to support the development of logistics-related services, enhancing employment opportunities and local economic growth. We have also improved food supply and socio-political stability in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Furthermore, we have contrib- uted to local operations and programmes promoted by the United Nations in a number of countries, such as South Sudan, Mali, Cameroon, Togo and Central African Republic.
In East Africa, the MEDLOG network ensures that coffee exports from landlocked Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda reach the rest of the continent and the world. In addition,
MSC and MEDLOG have jointly provided door-to-door logistics solutions to local branches of internation- al automotive companies for the delivery of knocked down vehicles from South Africa to assembly plants in Rwanda.
Moreover, MEDLOG has supported the improvement of Rwanda’s overall infrastructure by transporting bitumen containers to Kigali for building a new inter- national airport, which will foster incoming tourism and air freight flows.
In West Africa, MEDLOG is also offering crucial logistics solutions for the refurbishment of Gao Airport in Mali by ensuring that specific bitumen containers reach Gao after being discharged in the port of Cotonou (Benin). Similarly, in Niger we participated in projects relating to the construction of a new national road connecting Tchadoua and Mayahi.
MEDLOG’s assets in Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal (trucks, trailers, advanced methods for storage, conditioning and containers’ preparation) guarantee that agricultur- al products are stored in the best possible conditions before their intermodal shipment to or from landlocked Burkina Faso and Mali. MEDLOG dry port in Mali offers a flexible option to local importers.

Creating new opportunities for small farmers
Through our wide-scale operations, our worldwide local agencies network provides our customers and business partners with specialised reefer services tailored to their needs, whenever and wherever required. Backed by deep knowledge of post-harvest treatments, we have been targeting, in coordination with farmers and growers, the expansion of their business through new opportunities. The reefer container can quickly adapt to different capac- ity demands without requiring high levels of minimum inducement to start and stay in business. This factor enabled its usage by small players, while in the past this
specific trade was accessible mainly by big players with high volumes to trade. Additionally, the reefers support economies of scale, as fresh commodities can reach different trade areas, securing food supply availability regardless of the season. This means that, in the event of low local market demand, it helps to prevent food waste and the destruction of excess production as commodities can be traded in other regions of the world.
As an illustration, in Spain, our investments and strategic collaborations with small farmers helped to boost export rates of dairy products, fruit and vegetables to alternative markets. Additionally, through our “Reefer Mediterranean Project “, as well as in Asia and the Middle East, we offer local actors broader trade options through our global network, providing them with better return on revenue. At the same time, we offer accessible, sustainable forms of protection, such as ad hoc insurance policies, to minimise risks and to encourage small farmers to invest in more ambitious and inclusive business models.

 Fostering responsible consumption
and food safety
Sustainable development also relies upon sustainable consumption. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) “hunger is still one of the most urgent development challenges1”, yet “rough- ly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption – approximately 1.3 billion tons – is lost or wasted before reaching consumers2”. Food waste and poor food conservation practices are strictly interrelat- ed to poverty, as they have an impact on food prices in local markets and on the incomes of small farmers, while also creating barriers for people to access quality food. Additionally, they might contribute to the increase of malnutrition cases around the world, as they bring further challenges to the poorest households and vulnerable groups in affording adequate food and in implementing healthy habits and nutrition practices.
At MSC we believe that cold chains and cooling technol- ogy can make a dramatic difference in enhancing the supply of quality food and reducing post-harvest food loss, including losses related to water, energy, land and labour. By increasing the supply and affordability of quality food, reliable cold chains can play a key role in reducing poverty, fostering responsible consump- tion and promoting the right to health as set out by the SDGs. In this respect, we continue investing exten- sively in the latest available technologies, systems and processes for sustainable cold chains, in line with inter- national standards and regulations as well as our care for the environment. This also ensures that our custom- ers are offered the best transportation and cold storage conditions for their perishable cargoes, and provides the highest level of food safety and quality to final consumers.
Caring for the environment with sustainable cold chain technology
Regulations limiting ozone-depleting substances (ODS), notably the Montreal Protocol of 1987, led to the widespread use of fluorinated gases (F-gases) in many industrial sectors. These man-made gases have a high Global Warming Potential (GWP), ranging from about 12 to 14,800 times greater than carbon dioxide (CO2). As
1 Source: http://www.fao.org
2 Source: http://www.fao.org/save-food/resources/keyfindings/en/
emissions of F-gases are rising fast, the European Union passed an updated F-Gas Regulation in 2014 limiting their sale and banning their use in refrigeration systems if more environmentally friendly alternatives are available. The ban will apply to commercial refrigeration systems, such as reefer containers, from 2020. At an internation- al level, the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol will enter into force on 1 January 2019 with the aim of reducing worldwide production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), the main type of F-gas used in refrigeration technology. Partly caused by the stricter regulations, significant increases in the prices of refrig- erants are raising additional challenges.
Nevertheless, we have started to make necessary invest- ments in order to comply with the new regulations. Additionally, we have purchased thousands of new Carrier Transicold NaturaLINE® reefer containers with natural-refrigerant R-744 (CO2) which is now the best available technology compared to other refrigerants.
  COOLING TECHNOLOGIES AND PROTOCOLS
By controlling oxygen and carbon dioxide levels and removing the ripening hormone ethylene, our Controlled Atmosphere systems prevent premature ripening and reduce deterioration and spoilage. In addition, they maintain the appearance, freshness and quality of perishable foods over longer distances.
In-transit Cold Treatment protocols are a chemical-free way to eliminate fruit flies and other insects that might damage the biodiversity and agricultural industries
of importing countries. Our cooling and monitoring systems allow us to reliably keep the pulp of the fruit at the required temperature for the exposure period speci- fied in the protocols, which vary depending on the fruit and importing country.

PROTECTING OUR PLANET: A GLOBAL CHALLENGE
The adverse impacts of climate change have become more evident in recent decades and are increasing- ly affecting our planet and all human beings globally. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), climate change disproportion- ately affects vulnerable people and communities already in disadvantaged situations due to various factors. Tackling climate change challenges is therefore at the top of the international community’s agenda.
With the signing in 2015 of the Paris Agreement, countries have agreed that temperature rises should be limited to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels and that this will urgently require a global response from all stakeholders. Although the shipping sector is recognised as the world’s most cost-effective and energy efficient mass transportation method, account- able for only around 2.5% of global carbon emissions, it is subject to a challenging new set of technical and operational measures to further reduce emissions, as per international regulatory requirements.
The shipping sector has been affected by weaker global demand since 2009. In spite of this, the internation- al community predicts greater seaborne trade due to the estimated growth of national GDPs as well as the growth of economic and population trends towards 2050. As a consequence, shipping emissions are expected to increase between 50% and 250% by 2050 if no measures are taken to mitigate climate change. At the same time, maritime transport’s outlook continues to be shaped and affected by uncertainty, increasingly challenging market conditions, fluctuant oil prices and global socio-economic factors and trade policies. The whole sector is therefore under pressure to address ongoing and future challenges, including increasing financial challenges, and to secure sustainable solutions while remaining competitive in the global market. MSC is investing heavily in a number of technical solutions to meet or exceed the new regula- tions, finding innovative solutions and continuously improving its environmental performance.

OUR STRATEGY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE & ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
MSC’s environmental strategy and approach to sustain- ability demonstrate a clear commitment to running a responsible business while respecting the environment and embracing precautionary efforts to mitigate broad global climate change impacts.
To achieve its vision, MSC promotes a strategic focus on cleaner seas, land and cargo through massive invest- ments in innovative low-carbon technology, energy efficiency and operational efficiency. Additionally, MSC’s modern, green fleet was greatly enhanced in recent years by a retrofitting programme. We have invested extensive- ly in the latest generation of marine technologies, such as new energy-efficient propellers and bows to reduce
fuel consumption and therefore improve our energy efficiency.
We continuously monitor our environmental perfor- mance and have implemented a number of operational measures to further reduce our CO2 emissions to meet expected new regulations, including those to be adopt- ed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Our overall strategy involves an investment of approx- imately USD 1.5 billion. This enormous financial commitment was made possible by MSC’s growing and stable economic performance as well as by the continuous support of key financial institutions.

   SUPPORTING LOW-CARBON SHIPPING AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL
Improving the maritime industry’s long-term sustainability performance requires international cooperation.
In line with the SDGs promoting action on climate change and global partnerships, we participate actively
in international policy discussions and continuously strengthen our collab- oration with other stakeholders through important initiatives such as the
Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG). Furthermore, MSC is one of the found- ing members of the Global Industry Alliance (GIA) to support low-carbon shipping within the framework of the GEF-UNDP-IMO GloMEEP Project. Launched in June 2017, this new partnership of maritime industry leaders focuses on overcoming bar- riers to innovative technologies and taking operational measures that
will accelerate shipping’s transition
to a low-carbon future. In addition to promoting R&D, showcasing techno- logical advances, encouraging industry dialogue and implementing capacity- building and information-sharing activities, members contribute to
a GIA Fund. This fund helps to finance selected projects within the GIA’s
five areas of priority: energy efficiency technologies and operational best practices; alternative fuels; ports; digitalisation and the human element.

 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE
We are fully committed to further reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions across all our opera- tions. Emissions vary from vessel to vessel and voyage to voyage, for reasons including operational factors, vessel load and waiting times in ports. To monitor the perfor- mance of individual ships and our fleet over time, among other measures, we use the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) tool, as set out in the IMO Guideline MEPC.1/circ.684.
Our EEOI analyses show that we have significantly reduced our carbon dioxide emissions per metric tonne of cargo moved on a per mile basis. Between 2016 and 2017, we reduced our EEOI from 15.55 to 14.80, and between 2015 and 2017 from 16.58 to 14.80 indicating an efficiency improvement of 11%.
We are evaluating and considering implementing a dynam- ic tool, developed by sustainability solutions provider South Pole, to calculate our EEOI more frequently and specifical- ly. This will help us in our efforts to be transparent with our customers and stakeholders, as we will be able to better quantify the benefits of new technical and operational measures related to CO2 emission per cargo transported.

  Cross-cutting efforts to improve efficiency
To maximise the efficiency of our fleet and further reduce our ships’ energy consumption we use innovative technol- ogies and implement a number of operational measures. These include our continuous efforts towards cargo and fleet optimisation. Additionally, we have a dedicat- ed Energy Efficiency (EE) team based at our Geneva HQ, which, in cooperation with MSC Shipmanagement techni- cal offices, continuously monitors both the emission and fuel performance of the whole fleet, while identifying potential operational improvements during navigations. Our HQ Operations Department regularly liaises with Masters to plan the ocean routing of ships in order to ensure the most fuel-efficient route considering the weather, vessels’ load and stability conditions. It also monitors the vessels’ speed in adverse weather to avoid higher consumption, while maintaining the vessels’ sched- uled arrival time at port.
Enhanced data analysis & reporting
Through a series of complex geometrical models and statistical analysis, together with state-of-the-art automatic data acquisition and analytical tools developed internally for this purpose, the MSC Shipmanagement technical team and the EE team regularly:
• Monitorthehullperformanceofeachvesselagainst its own baseline, facilitating the decision on any planned intervention like hull cleaning, advancing dry-docking of the vessel, etc.
• Ensure that the minimum number of generators are running for the required power demand on board. Our advanced data analytics tool automatically creates an alert if the generators run below a specified load over a defined period
• Ensure the main engine always operates within the optimum range
• Monitorandensurethatavesselalwayssailsatoptimum trim, as per our state-of-the-art CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) trim optimisation module
• Ensure that the reefer cargo is always optimised as per the vessel’s available electrical power
• Monitor the overall energy efficiency management of the vessel
We estimate a fuel saving of 58,000 tons over the year, with a consequent emission reduction of 180,000 tons of CO2 in 2017. In addition to monitoring energy efficien- cy, these systems help us to provide precise answers to
increasing enquiries from our stakeholders with regards to our environmental performance, emission counts and compliance with forthcoming data reporting regulations. These include the European Union’s MRV (Monitoring Reporting & Verification) and the IMO DCS (Data Collection System).
Operational efficiency of terminals
The HQ Operations Department liaises with all termi- nals and ports worldwide to ensure that operations are performed in line with international standards relating to the safety of vessels, cargo and the environment. Our subsidi- ary, TiL, continuously invests in improving the operational efficiency of more than 50 container terminals around the world. Current efficiency strategies include measures to cut unproductive procedures, such as reshuffling contain- ers during delivery, in order to reduce emissions as well as waiting times for our customers.

 FLEET & CAPACITY GROWTH
As our fleet grows and technology develops, we continuously engage with shipbuilders, design firms, classification societies and other stakeholders to ensure that our strategic investments are both environmental- ly and economically viable.
Through investments in capacity management and econo- mies of scale, we have managed to increase our average capacity per ship from 2,500 TEU in 2003 to 6,500 TEU in 2017, significantly higher than the average of the top 10 cargo carriers.
Pioneering new ships
Confirmed in Q3 2017, our order of 11 x 23,000 TEU container ships underlines our leading role in driving global standards of ship design and energy efficiency. With delivery scheduled for 2019 and 2020, these mega-ships will be propelled by ultra-efficient G-type engines and will include the latest energy-saving technol- ogies in line with the IMO’s Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) standards. In addition, the ground-breaking size of the new ships will significantly reduce emissions per amount of cargo carried.
Fleet renewal programme
Over the last six years, we have been upgrading our fleet of owned and operated ships to the latest standards of safety and fuel efficiency. Since its launch in 2011, our retrofitting programme has considerably reduced carbon dioxide emissions. In 2017, we retrofitted more than 250 ships with energy-saving technologies, includ- ing a specially designed bulbous bow, lighter and more efficient propellers, and new rudders designed to reduce drag. Hulls are treated with a silicon-based anti-fouling coating to minimise friction, the need for underwater cleaning and the risk of spread of invasive species. At the same time, our ship management centres are retro- fitting our ships’ main propulsion engines to make them more efficient.
The impacts of this extensive effort are reflected within the carbon reduction results detailed in the section “Continuous improvement of our environmental perfor- mance” on page 38 of this report.

INVESTING IN INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES
Eco-containers
MSC cares for the environment, working closely and actively with manufacturers to build containers using sustainable materials. One recent eco-initiative consti- tutes our investment in bamboo flooring at an early stage. Our current new productions are close to 100% fitted with bamboo flooring, which improves environ- mental and economic efficiency.
Bamboo is kinder to the environment, due to its bio- degradability and availability. It is in abundance compared to conventional wood. Bamboo is also a highly renewable resource, with price competitivity, as bamboo plants grow to full maturity in 4-6 years, compared to over 20 years for hardwood. A bamboo plantation also releases 35% more oxygen than an equivalent area of normal trees, and bamboo has better durability and impact resistance. China has the largest output of Moso Bamboo ( 90% of the world’s production): it is found in 27 provinces, cities and municipalities including Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Guangdong, Chongqing, Yunnan Guangxi, Guizhou and Sichuan, which account for 66.7% of the bamboo-growing area in China.
This availability of bamboo in China is convenient, given our ongoing container production facilities in the country. Moreover, as of 1 July 2016, the Government of the People’s Republic of China approved mandatory require- ments regarding the use of Water-Based Paint (WBP) for containers to minimise Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions. MSC was a pioneer in this respect.
For instance, we were promoting the use of WBP on our containers long before the regulations came into effect, even though WBP technology was in the initial stage and the market was hesitant to use it. Yearly over 300,000 TEU of containers are now produced for MSC with WBP technology.

THE 2020 SULPHUR CAP
MSC is strongly committed to contributing to global efforts to reduce emissions from ships, and fully supports uniform enforcement of the decision by the IMO relating to the 2020 global cap on fuel sulphur content. This will reduce the sulphur limit for marine fuel from the current 3.5% m/m to 0.5% m/m globally and to 0.1% m/m in designated Emission Control Areas (ECAs), as implemented in 2015.
We have invested heavily in exploring various strat- egies to comply with the 2020 Sulphur Cap. The MSC Shipmanagement technical team has been working on this since 2013 to research, analyse, review and propose various available options: Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and Ultra- Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (ULSFO). Our compliance strategy will continue to evolve in line with developments in technology and changes in the cost and availability of different fuels.
  42 MSC’S COMMITMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT

 COMPARISON OF MAIN OPTIONS FOR SHIPOWNERS
Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (ECGS)
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
Low Sulphur Fuels
Based on current forecasts and considering the size of our fleet, there is a strong business and environmental case for retrofitting our ships with EGCS. These systems spray alkaline water into a vessel’s exhaust either via an open-loop system, closed-loop system, or hybrid (open-and-closed loop) system, to eliminate nearly all SOx and 70-80% of particulate matter (PM) from High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO). The systems are costly and complex to install, however, with drydock, manufacturing and installation capacity all being potential limiting factors.
LNG produces almost zero SOx and PM emissions and reduces nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by up to 85–90%. However, large-scale use of LNG for cargo ships would require very substantial improvements in global bunkering infrastructure, since few major ports have developed full-scale LNG bunkering facilities.
Low sulphur fuels, such as Marine Gas Oil (MGO) and new blends of Ultra
Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (ULSFO) contain less than 0.1% sulphur and require minimal structural or operational changes. However, low-sulphur fuel costs
are projected to generally remain significantly higher than for HSFO. With our large and globally active fleet, the quality, availability and reliability of new fuel blends are key issues to consider. ULSFO plays a significant role in our current fuel mix and we will continue to monitor developments.

ADVOCATING FOR SHORE POWER SUPPLY
We strongly believe that shore power supply (SPS) is one solution that terminals can adopt to improve local air quality, where the source provides a net environmen- tal benefit. By switching from generators to the onshore electrical grid, ships can reduce their emissions in port by around 80%.
Since 2014, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) has required shipping lines to use SPS for a minimum percentage of their vessels, set at 70% for 2017. The proven benefits of SPS could be replicated in ports worldwide. However, while 143 of our vessels are able to run on shore power supply, only three termi- nals – all in California – are currently equipped with this technology. We are therefore actively promoting investment in SPS technology throughout our termi- nal network.

 BALLAST WATER TREATMENT
Ballast water helps ships maintain trim and stability, but poor ballast water management can release invasive marine species that damage local ecosystems and biodi- versity. The IMO’s Ballast Water Management Convention, which entered into force on 8 September 2017, requires all ships to implement a Ballast Water and Sediments Management Plan, carry a Ballast Water Record Book and perform ballast water treatment to a given standard.
We have been working with shipbuilders, classification societies and others to ensure that our new ship designs require the minimum possible amount of ballast water. During 2017, we completed our ambitious programme to instal ballast water treatment systems across our existing fleet and are now fully compliant with the requirements, well in advance of the internationally required date for almost all ships.
COLLABORATION BETWEEN MSC GROUP’S DIVISIONS TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT
The MSC Group benefits greatly in the area of Environmental Stewardship from the synergies between its two divisions. For example, development work on LNG propulsion by MSC Cruises greatly informs evaluation of this technology by the Cargo Division. Furthermore, environmental leadership in Advanced Wastewater Treatment, Solid Waste Management and EGCS systems have all been to the benefit of the entire MSC Group. Similarly, extensive work for the Cargo Division in connection with energy efficiency, marine fuels, and SPS have been extremely useful in related applications for MSC Cruises.
MSC Cruises’ investment in LNG technology
In addition to equipping its ships with Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS), MSC Cruises is making signif- icant investments in LNG technology as part of its strategy to mitigate air pollution. In particular, in 2017, MSC Cruises committed to developing and installing LNG engines on
its ‘World Class’ ships (two firm orders and two options). The four LNG-powered cruise ships are due to come into service between 2022 and 2027. Each of these ships repre- sents a capital investment exceeding EUR 1 billion.
We believe that LNG is one of the key elements that will support our continuous efforts in reducing our impact on the environment. LNG is arguably the clean- est commercially available marine fuel at the moment and we believe it will be a game-changer for the cruise sector in the years to come. Along with other industry players, MSC Cruises wishes to actively contribute to this positive evolution.
LNG reduces SOx emissions by more than 99% and NOx emissions by up to 85% compared to conventional marine fuel. It also largely eliminates particulate matter from the exhaust gases and produces the same amount of energy with approximately 20% less CO2 emissions during the course of the engine operation, compared to conventional cruise ships of a similar size.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH & SAFETY
MSC’s commitment towards the protection of the environment and the promotion of responsible occupa- tional health and safety practices are essential parts of its philosophy and contributing factors to its business success. MSC aims to prevent any loss of life and unnec- essary risk to human health in its business operations, as well as to ensure environmental safety and proper cargo-handling and management.
To do so, MSC has its own Health, Safety, Security and Environmental (HSSE) policy, in line with applicable requirements defined for international shipping, most commonly known as the ‘four pillars of the international regulatory regime for quality shipping’:
• International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) – Emergencies, Fire Prevention, Life-saving Appliances, Safety of Navigation, Carriage of Cargoes, International Safety Management (ISM) and International Ship and Port Facilities Security Codes (ISPS)
• International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) – Environment, Chemicals, Waste and Air
• Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping (STCW) – Standards of qualification for the Master, officers and crew on seagoing merchant ships
• MaritimeLabourConvention(MLC)–Workingcondi- tions on ships, including conditions of employment, health protection, medical care and social security protection

in its business operations, as
well as to ensure environmental safety and proper cargo-handling and management.
Additionally, our “Responsible Cargo Care Policy” focuses on safe container-handling procedures. In accordance with the 2015 guidelines for the develop- ment of the Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM) developed by the IMO, we ensure proper handling of hazardous materials, regulate waste management and ensure prevention of accidental exposure to our crew. In this respect, on board our vessels, we maintain an IHM and related statements of compliance issued by an independent classification society. IHMs contain details on listed dangerous material quantities and locations on board vessels, and these inventories are updat- ed during any new installation or modification on our vessels throughout their operational life. Furthermore, during the year 2017, the MSC Shipmanagement Office based in Cyprus undertook a fleet-wide project for IHM surveys and used data from these surveys to review its procurement procedures for further mitigating the risk on board vessels in relation to a number of restricted hazardous materials.

PROMOTING A CULTURE OF SAFETY ON BOARD
MSC Shipmanagement in Cyprus is responsible, among other duties, for the selection, recruitment, training and management of our crew, in line with MSC’s vision, mission and core values. In the last ten years, MSC Shipmanagement’s continuous focus on organisational development, capacity building and innovation at work has enabled it to cope with the rapid growth of MSC operat- ed fleet and at the same time to ensure high performance at all levels of the organisation. Growing and developing crew professional competence through training in both soft and technical skills represents a key investment area for our company. To increase our rapid responsiveness to risks, these training programmes also include specific modules on emergencies and unexpected events, such as natural disasters.
Throughout 2017, over 750 people from management and operational levels attended our leadership development training programme and our junior training programme welcomes some 500 cadets and trainees every year. Due to our fleet growth, we can offer an increasing number of job opportunities. We intend to continue focusing on providing leadership development across all ranks and on empowering our people to enable them to take on increasing responsibilities. We strongly encourage and support our crew to invest in their professional develop- ment and facilitate long-term career path plans, from junior to managerial positions.
A value-driven work culture
We believe that only a value-driven work culture can ensure the development of a truly sustainable business activity and an enduring sense of belonging to any organ- isation. We therefore aim to build a positive working environment both on board vessels and in shore-based offices based on open communication, accountability, continuing education, knowledge-sharing and technical training opportunities.
Our fundamental organisational principles are: • acting fairly;
• fostering cooperation;
• building a climate of reciprocal trust
and respect.
Adapting our organisational structure, investing in our people, bringing innovation and applying the MSC work culture all create added value in terms of quality of staff, process optimisation, shipping efficiency, quality stand- ards, environmental protection and corporate reputation. The same elements have made MSC Shipmanagement one of the largest in-house ship management compa- nies in the world, recognised as such by awards from industry associations and the Governments of Cyprus, India and Ukraine. For the same reasons, we enjoy an exceptionally high crew retention rate as well as an extraordinary reputation among qualified job candi- dates wishing to join us in the future.

FOSTERING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND HUMAN SAFETY AT SEA
Our care for people is demonstrated by our MSC’s staff development strategy and professional training which focus, in particular, on ensuring personal, cargo and navigational safety. Additionally, the MSC Operations Department based at the Headquarters provides brief- ings to Masters on a regular basis to raise awareness about the latest developments in safety procedures and ensure their implementation. The Department constantly liaises with the whole fleet to report updated route plans to enable proper risk assessments related the safety of crew, vessels and the environment. This aims to effec- tively mitigate the risks of incidents at sea.
Crisis management
MSC believes that early warning and rapid decision- making mechanisms are crucial for ensuring the safety of its crews and customers’ freight in case of maritime emergencies. All crisis management operations imply the prompt involvement of dedicated experts under the supervision of the experienced MSC senior manage- ment. Capt. Gianluigi Aponte, the company’s founder, and Mr. Diego Aponte, President & CEO, are personally involved in the monitoring and management of every significant emergency operation. Following their instruc- tions, HQ Operations Department remains in constant contact with the crew members to rapidly resolve the emergency situation, including potential medical emergencies occurring either on board or at sea amid difficult conditions.
MSC Group’s safety culture does not include cost-saving considerations when human lives are at stake.
As an illustration, in the autumn of 2017, our central management offices launched four emergency oper- ations entailing the diversion of MSC ships with crew members in need of medical aid from their intend- ed routes to Salalah (Oman), Maputo (Mozambique), Athens (Greece) and Los Angeles (USA). The purpose was to let local authorities provide the seafarers with medical assistance and hospitalisation in the fast possi- ble way. In October 2017, a special operation was also put in place to arrange the helicopter evacuation of an injured crew member from an MSC vessel off the Dutch coast to an hospital in Amsterdam.
It is our moral duty to help people and fellow seafarers in trouble during maritime operations. For this reason, MSC crews are all well trained and keen to guarantee the safety not only of MSC ships but also of any vessel, personnel and person in distress at sea.
As an example, in 2017, our staff carried out a number of rescue operations exclusively aimed at saving human lives at sea. The most dramatic one involved the rescue of a stranded Japanese surfer from choppy waters off Kembla (Australia) to give him medical first aid and take him back to shore. An MSC ship assisted the crew of another company’s vessel off the West African coast that reported fire in the engine room. The MSC vessel provided communication facilities and food to the crew of the other vessel until emergency towing arrange- ments for the other vessel were delivered a day later.

MSC’S TECHNICAL SKILLS TRAINING MODEL
MSC continuously invests in enhancing its employees’ technical skills. As an illustration, in the past ten years, MSC Shipmanagement in Cyprus has devoted 1 million hours to training and capacity-building efforts.
The MSC training model is designed to coach both on-board and shore-based staff using the most advanced technological methods. For instance, we are among the few multinational companies whose training centres are equipped with the latest generation of full mission bridge and engine simulators. In our training facilities in India, Italy, Montenegro and Ukraine, MSC trainers are
focused on improving crews’ professional skills through the simulation of credible incidents and knowledge trans- fer on navigational safety.
In the last two years, over 2,000 navigating officers, including a number of Masters, have completed simula- tion courses and acquired the relevant skills to operate MSC large container vessels.
Furthermore, in accordance with IMO recommendations, we have pioneered the implementation of the Electronic Chart Display Information System (ECDIS) and trained some 7,000 navigating officers to effectively operate it.

WORKING CONDITIONS
AND CREW RETENTION RATES
MSC has at present a 98% crew retention rate, as per the industry standard Intertanko formula*.
We believe that such a high rate is a clear recognition of our efforts to provide our crew with a safe working environ- ment and the highest standards in working conditions. In this respect, we are extremely proud to report that in the 2017 survey almost two thirds of MSC crew members (66%) stated their wish to work for MSC until the end of their career, 1% higher than in 2015. Around 77% expressed a wish to sail for us for more than 4 years. Finally, only 1% of respondents stated they plan to stay with MSC for less than one year.
*Note: Introduced in 2008 by Intertanko, an association of independent tanker owners promoting safe transport, cleaner seas and fair competition, the Intertanko formula is cons- idered a standard within the merchant shipping industry. (www.intertanko.com)

Internet on board
The earlier crew engagement survey undertaken in 2015 resulted in some areas of improvement regard- ing on-board internet facilities. MSC Shipmanagement technical offices took practical actions in this regard, ensuring that our vessels are equipped with the latest satellite communication systems and are kept upgraded continuously, thus improving performance and offering to the crew a variety of services, much like they would experience ashore.
The key benefits for crew we have observed so far include keeping up-to-date with daily news and global events, feeling closer to their families and making use of online services such as internet banking, research and educa- tion. The 2017 Nautilus International study on crew at sea observed a correlation between on-board connec- tivity and staff retention rates. The same study states that this could be directly related to crew members’ abili- ty to maintain connections with family and friends back home. Social interaction could also significantly mitigate the sense of loneliness while away and have a positive impact on the mental health of crew members.
Cyber security
Efficient on-board connectivity systems improve not only the crew’s well-being but also navigational safety by enabling vessels to be in constant and reliable communication with on-shore offices. This helps signif- icantly to mitigate either maritime or operational risks and results in better performance. A connected ship can transfer real-time data to the shore via telemetry information, remote access to systems and equipment for diagnostics, troubleshooting, updates and mainte- nance. In this respect, on-board connectivity contributes to better provision of real-time information on potential critical situations such as piracy attacks, chart correc- tions, voyage planning/routing, weather and medical assistance. It also allows onshore management offices to look after the navigational safety of vessels by sharing operational documents and data at a faster pace, keeping up-to-date records on their activity and running remote investigations.

Nevertheless, the increasing use of web-based naviga- tion systems with interfaces to land-based networks is making systems ever more vulnerable to cyber attacks. On-board connectivity systems, including computers, for internal management and “uncontrolled” mobile devices, can be easily infected with malware and allow cyber-at- tackers to gain access to ships’ security systems. Every operation requires a different, complex solution, which in turn requires investment to protect on-board connec- tivity systems against potential attacks.
For all these reasons, at MSC we take cyber securi- ty on board our connected vessels very seriously. To mitigate the risk of cyber attacks, we are investing in the latest hardware and software as well as in training to provide procedural updates and guidelines for users. Some cyber-security measures we have taken so far include the implementation of a UTMS or Unified Threat Management Service, the installation of smart devic- es blocking unauthorised access and misuse, and the constant monitoring of potentially suspicious activities.

IMPLEMENTATION OF MSC CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT
MSC has its own Code of Business Conduct which is in line with internationally recognised standards as well as the Ten UN Global Compact Principles on Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption.
During 2017, MSC continued to develop a culture of integ- rity within the organisation, setting forth and monitoring compliance with common standards of ethical behav- iour as well as all applicable laws, regulations, policies and procedures. Training courses on the MSC Code of Business Conduct, for instance, are provided to all employees around the globe. Their content is regularly updated and an e-learning training tool will be launched in 2018. Furthermore, MSC monitors the implementation of the Code of Business Conduct within its agencies world- wide in collaboration with local “Code Implementers”. As part of its compliance programme, MSC has in place a reporting mechanism which also serves to promote a
dialogue with internal stakeholders. All reports made by employees are evaluated with care and, based on these, internal investigations may be initiated, as appropriate. During 2017, MSC made further efforts to strengthen transparency and build trust within the organisation, for example, by encouraging employees to report miscon- ducts. At present, the HQ Compliance and the Corporate Audit Departments are in charge of establishing and implementing a centralised reporting tool.
During 2017, MSC also reinforced the cooperation between the Compliance Department and the Corporate Audit Department to ensure all ethical standards and relevant policies are correctly implemented through- out the organisation. In particular, the Corporate Audit Department performs on-site visits of MSC’s agencies and reports on its findings to various internal stakeholders.
60 BUSINESS ETHICS AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS

PROMOTING FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES
MSC strongly supports the Tenth Principle of the UN Global Compact in the area of anti-corruption. MSC is committed to a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. It has policies and procedures that outline responsibilities for all employees around the globe to comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws. Actions taken in 2017 include global communication and follow-up of the implementation as per local laws of the MSC Anti-Bribery Policy within MSC agencies world- wide. In order to embed ethics and further foster an anti-corruption culture in the most effective way around the globe, the MSC Anti-Bribery Policy is available in 11 different languages. MSC also launched a mandatory e-learning training module for all employees to enhance anti-corruption awareness and improve its anti-corrup- tion programme.
In 2017, MSC issued the MSC Conflict of Interest Policy which provides guidelines on how to define, identify, report and manage actual and potential situations of conflict of interest. An e-learning training module was also created to improve knowledge and awareness on conflicts of interest.
In addition, MSC adopted a Gifts and Corporate Hospitality Procedure applicable to employees working in MSC’s headquarters in Switzerland. The Procedure is designed to provide employees with guidance on what can be accepted as a gift. It also provides a set of self-decision-making principles and guidelines to enable employees to tackle corruption.
MSC strives to impose on identified business partners contractual obligations of compliance with applic- able anti-corruption laws. MSC also encourages such business partners to comply with similar standards to those set out in the MSC Code of Business Conduct.
MSC is committed to a zero-tolerance approach
to bribery and corruption.
 Multi-stakeholder approach to advance SDGs
To further promote SDGs 16 and 17, MSC seeks collab- orations with cross-industrial networks when collective actions are required to advance key social responsibility practices in line with its standards. In October 2017, MSC joined the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN), a global business network composed of maritime indus- try leaders working together towards the vision of a maritime industry free of corruption. The MACN allows MSC to collaborate with other shipping lines to share best practices and develop strategies to tackle corrup- tion in the maritime sector and, more specifically, within the container shipping industry. The MACN Container Working Group represents around 65% of the contain- er carrier market.
MSC also took the initiative to join TRACE International, a globally recognised, nonprofit anti-bribery associa- tion, to expand its knowledge and expertise in this field.

BASCAP-business action to stop
counterfeiting and piracy
MSC is part of BASCAP (Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy). BASCAP was created under the umbrella of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) to raise awareness of the economic and social harm generated by counterfeiting and piracy activities and their potential risks to the health and safety of consumers. Members of BASCAP advocate for the adoption, enforcement and protection of brand holders’ intel- lectual property (IP) rights before local, national and international authorities. BASCAP has also been dealing with cross-cutting issues, including the links between the production and selling of counterfeit goods and other criminal activities such as drug smuggling, terrorism, child labour and prostitution.
Since 2016, MSC has engaged in constructive discus- sions on carriers’ activities and related challenges. We also actively participate in the establishment of the best practices that are set to become the future standard for the industry, and suggest innovative approaches due to our comprehensive understanding of the international shipping supply chain.
Women’s empowerment
According to the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF), “women make up only an estimated 2% of the world’s maritime workforce”. Despite continu- ous efforts from the shipping industry and international organisations, such as the IMO, to reduce gender gaps, improve working conditions at sea and promote safety awareness, being a seafarer is still considered a challenging career for a woman.
In line with SDGs 1, 5 and 10, MSC strongly promotes access to employment opportunities for female candi- dates, both shipboard and ashore and encourages women’s integration into maritime activities. However, we are fully aware that increasing the female quota in our recruitment procedures and creating KPIs based merely on quantitative indicators on gender diver- sity do not necessarily contribute to effectively reducing gender disparities and advancing women’s empowerment. We therefore strive to mainstream gender inclusive practices into our business models by providing maritime training and related vocational training to our female employees, at all levels. We also support women’s partic- ipation in decision-making processes by offering equal career paths in accordance with the principles of equal opportunity, fair treatment and non-discrimination, in line with our Code of Business Conduct.
To improve current practices on women’s empowerment we encourage continuous dialogue with our employ- ees, and in particular with our female employees, to better understand their concerns and improve their working conditions. In this respect, in 2017 we carried out a human rights assessment in collaboration with the Global Human Resources Department and local Human Resources Officers based in MSC agencies. Based on the assessment’s preliminary findings we will remain strongly focused on: a) respecting cultural diversity as part of our inclusive approach to promoting communi- ties’ involvement; b) providing training opportunities in soft and technical skills, especially for female employ- ees; and c) ensuring health-related support in order to help employees increase their productivity, thus reduc- ing absenteeism rates as well as promoting women’s empowerment.

environments, appropriate facilities, strong management support and relevant policies in order for women to feel adequately supported and encouraged, especially when returning to work after maternity. In this respect, as an illustration, our local office in the Dominican Republic opened a dedicated breastfeeding room, in line with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, creating a work environment that supports new mothers and enhances their quality of life.
In Gabon, we focus on promoting healthy nutrition practices and improving stress management. Further to our employees’ request, we decided to offer the possibility to participate in sports activities with a profes- sional trainer free of charge after working hours. We also support local awareness-raising campaigns on women’s health, such as the annual marathon support- ing women’s cancer research.
 MSC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 63

 PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS BEYOND COMPLIANCE
MSC is committed to helping address poverty and inequalities. For instance, we strive to ensure that our employees are offered long-term career prospects in safe and healthy working conditions.
We are aware that social challenges, including the lack of quality and affordable health facilities, can have an impact not only on turnover, absenteeism rates and employees’ productivity but also on employers’ efforts to recruit and retain local employees, especially in devel- oping countries.
Our business models therefore take into consideration human development indicators based on official country profiles developed by international organisations and human rights assessments undertaken at country levels by our local agencies.
Social actions by the Terminal of San Pedro (TSP)
In 2017, MSC and San Pedro Port signed a 35-year conces- sion agreement for the expansion of the San Pedro Container Terminal in Côte d’Ivoire. The concession agreement was signed just weeks after MSC celebrated its 15th anniver- sary of operations and investments in Côte d’Ivoire. Our renewed engagement will help to generate inclusive and social growth through job creation and vocational training. Since 2015, TSP has multiplied its efforts to improve employees’ access to social benefits and health facilities. The Terminal now grants all its employees invalidity/ death insurance, which will provide up to 36 months of salary to the family in case of death. Furthermore, TSP covers 80% of the costs of the health insurance for all its employees and members of their families.
64 BUSINESS ETHICS AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS

TSP has also implemented a ticket restaurant system paying 50% of the cost of every meal bought and eaten in the company’s canteen, thus encouraging employees to eat at the workplace. This has significantly reduced cases of digestion-related diseases due to poor hygiene practices, as well as poor food availability and food conservation.
Furthermore, a comprehensive 5-year action plan will be launched in 2018, with the aim of improving the health and well-being of women and men at work.
The plan includes programmes on matters related to health and hygiene at work. For example, it will provide free medical assistance to employees in the case of diseases such as malaria and typhoid fever, as well as vaccination campaigns against avoidable diseases. Furthermore, to raise awareness on breast and uterine cancer, the Terminal will bear the costs of mammo- grams and pap tests for all women employees and the

TSP also plans to create a nursery and offer specific training sessions on health matters such as food conser- vation. Awards will be granted to encourage healthy practices in the workplace.
Additional initiatives to promote access to quality education and women’s empowerment are planned for the coming years. For instance, the Terminal will imple- ment a university scholarship programme for the children of low-income employees every year, based on pre- defined criteria. Applications from young women will be strongly encouraged.
Moreover, the Terminal will continue to offer a literacy programme for its employees and an English language course for those who use English in their daily work.

The immediate impact on the health of local populations is clear, with nearly 10,800 patients treated on board the ship and in land-based dental and eye clinics renovated by Mercy Ships volunteers. This included almost 2,800 surgical procedures, ranging from orthopaedic surgery to women’s health. The facilities were then passed on to local authorities, helping to improve regional healthcare infrastructure. Included in the 44 containers of medical equipment shipped by MSC were ultrasound machines and biomedical equipment for donation to four hospi- tals in Cameroon.
Both Mercy Ships and MSC recognise the importance of continuity to ensure better long-term health outcomes for local populations. Capacity-building measures include providing courses, mentoring and observation opportunities to nearly 1,900 local healthcare profession- als. These programmes, which cover essential medical skills such as primary trauma care, pain management and neonatal resuscitation, include training 115 local healthcare professionals to train others. Our commit- ment to Mercy Ships and to the communities it serves remains strong and we are aiming to enhance our partnership in the coming years.

 MSC for UNICEF field trip in Malawi, Mr. Vago, MSC Cruises Executive Chairman
Humanitarian aid in the Caribbean region
In September 2017, a series of extremely powerful hurri- canes caused widespread and catastrophic damage in the north-eastern Caribbean and Florida. MSC Group companies contributed significantly to a worldwide effort to support the affected communities and islands in the Caribbean that were most impacted.
Through its vast network, MSC engaged in a compre- hensive effort to provide meaningful assistance to the Caribbean islands in need, including Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, Tortola and Dominica. MSC procured and shipped multiple containers of vital goods, such as water, food, building materials, personal supplies, lighting, mattresses, empty containers for shelter and medical supplies. Goods were delivered through cargo containers provided by MSC Cargo Division and through ferries provided by GNV, part of MSC’s Passenger Division.
With all the schools in the British Virgin Islands destroyed in the hurricane, MSC also purchased and shipped from the US a large semi-permanent structure to be used as a school in the region. Along with other players in the cruise industry, MSC worked to support local govern- ments in their efforts to improve the living conditions of the affected communities and rebuild basic infrastruc- tures that were impacted by the hurricane.
Tackling child malnutrition in Malawi
MSC Cruises and UNICEF have worked in partner- ship since 2009. In 2013, together they established a global project that aims to assist children affected by crisis and malnutrition in developing countries, includ- ing in Ethiopia, South Sudan, Somalia and Malawi. The initiative encourages MSC Cruises’ guests across the fleet to make a donation to UNICEF. Since 2013, thanks to the generous donations of guests, more than EUR 7.7 million has been raised. This has enabled us to provide 2,262,900 sachets of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food and 30,660 sachets of therapeutic milk for the treat- ment of malnourished children.
In 2017, MSC Cruises and its passengers raised EUR 1,428,165 for UNICEF. This helped to treat 13,799 children with Severe Acute Malnutrition in Malawi. As part of the “MSC for Malawi” cooperation with UNICEF, six MSC Cargo Division containers carrying 22,941 items of essential goods were dispatched from Italy to Malawi. This was a contribution to the ongoing relief efforts supported by the international communities, internation- al development actors and United Nations Specialized Agencies, including UNICEF.
The Items were distributed at the Chikwawa District Hospital and to schools and care groups in Gonda Village. The hospital received mattresses and children’s play

  equipment, which are used in the feeding programmes. Bicycles are supporting health workers in the follow-up and management of malnutrition cases. Schools received soccer balls, writing pads and colouring books. Finally, community volunteers worked to promote good nutri- tion practices and identify and support children affected by malnutrition. They also received pots for the prepara- tion of therapeutic milk and other foods, as well as farm utensils for vegetable gardens to supplement the food reserves and increase food diversity in the community. MSC Cruises is also actively engaged in raising aware- ness of UNICEF’s global mission among children and families on board through jointly organised advocacy campaigns and related educational programmes. In 2017, more than 200,000 children aged 5 to 17 were involved in these initiatives.
Sierra Leone mudslide
MSC staff in Sierra Leone contributed to the relief effort following the tragic flooding and mudslides in August 2017, working in collaboration with local stakeholders. The United Nations International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated that 500 people died due to the events of 14 August, with several thousand others affected in some way. Other reports put the death toll as high as 1,000. Efforts by governments and human- itarian organisations, as well as businesses, helped to accelerate the recovery.
Amid heavy rains in the weeks that followed the disas- ters, MSC worked with local communities in the hillside town of Regent and parts of the capital Freetown. Donations of cooking oil, food such as rice, and cloth- ing helped ease the suffering.
Empowering people and communities in Haiti
In December 2017, the MSC Group launched a new partnership with the Andrea Bocelli Foundation (ABF) to support some of the most disadvantaged communi- ties in Haiti. MSC Group will support ABF’s Health and Educational Projects in Haiti, collecting funds on board MSC Seaside.
The MSC Group has worked closely with the ABF to identify, design and implement a long-term partnership that aims to improve communities’ living conditions and deliver education programmes to over 2,550 children living in some of the most disadvantaged areas of the country.
MSC is also supporting the ABF’s Mobile Clinic project, which focuses on free health care assistance and prevention programmes that benefit over 8,000 people per year living in the five poorest and most remote areas of Haiti. The medical staff provide a wide range of services, including medical care, vaccination for children aged 3 to 7, nutrition surveillance and monitor- ing, screening tests for common illnesses and health conditions, health education and family consultations.

and inclusive trading system. Towards this end, we work to reduce complexity by digitising global trade. As physical lockdowns moved more customers online during 2020, we saw significant growth in our digital solutions, such as Maersk Spot, the Maersk app and Twill.
A step-up on decarbonisation
Decarbonising logistics is where we can and must move the needle the most for sustainable development. Maersk remains fully committed to our ambition of eliminating greenhouse
gas emissions, as we continue to work towards net-zero emissions from our ocean activities
in 2050; a 60% relative reduction in emissions from shipping by 2030 compared to 2008, and investigating how we can expand our net-zero ambition to cover our full operations and value chain across all emission scopes. We recognise that climate action is a strategic imperative for our company and have redesigned our organisation in order to embed the agenda and ensure collaboration across our business activities.
In 2020, we began a process to step up our efforts on decarbonisation. I strongly believe that we, as an industry leader and with the resources available to us, have an obligation to do all we can to get to a carbon-neutral fleet as fast as possible. We will not be using transition fuels, but will instead leapfrog directly to net zero fuels. The launch of the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping in 2020, made possible by our majority shareholder, the A.P. Moller Foundation, together with a group of industry-leading players, is an important step in aid of our commitments.
As Maersk 's presence grows on land to
offer integrated logistics solutions, so does our responsibility and commitment to help our customers decarbonise their global supply chains end to end. This is an integral part of our strategic promise of serving all our customers' transportation and logistics needs, and we will engage with customers and industry partners to develop standards and solutions to support this green transition.
Strengthening the foundation
We are strengthening the responsible business practices that constitute the foundation of our sustainable end-to-end offerings to our customers as well as our own operations.
Guided by our core company values, our commitments to international standards and guidelines, and with high expectations from customers, investors, regulators, employees and other stakeholders, we continue to address challenges across our operations and supply chains, including key areas such as ship recycling and safety.
We have taken on the task of using our leverage to drive responsible practices in the ship recycling industry. After four years in Alang, India, we know that this is possible, and with still larger vessels in our fleet nearing end of life, it is imperative that we create opportunities for responsible ship recycling at yards outside OECD countries. We are engaging actively
to find options that ensure enforcement of international conventions while also enabling global opportunities for responsible ship recycling that benefit both shipowners and local communities.
Failing safely
The foundation for safety in Maersk is to build capacity for 'failing safely', acknowledging that even while all precautionary measures must
be applied, some accidents and incidents are likely to still occur, but the implications of these should be as small as possible.
One of our contractors lost his life while working for Maersk in 2020. This saddens me deeply and emphasises that we need to do more to manage our risks and build the capacity we need to avoid such a tragic event.
To this end, we centralised the organisation of our safety work in 2020. The new organisation reinforces that Maersk has one shared safety strategy which is implemented and enforced equally across the company.
The decision is driven by the need to match and mirror the integrated company that Maersk is becoming, and also by the need to establish
a stronger link between the company’s strategic priorities and the implementation level, to ensure that we continue to learn and manage risks by listening to our frontline employees. Most importantly to ensure the continuous safety and security of our people, but also to assure our customers that this is the case when they leave their supply chain obligations in our hands.
In simple terms, we will not be satisfied until
we reach our ambition of eliminating fatalities and severe injuries and provide safe and resilient products and services to our customers.
Social movements a timely reminder
2020 saw the renewed strength of social movements to promote race and gender equality.
Our global presence means that we are affected by events and movements regardless of where they take place. Notable examples such as Black Lives Matter in the US, which has spilled over to many other countries, and new waves of #metoo serve as timely reminders that we must continue conversations on diversity and inclusion and take action where needed.
Maersk is a values-driven company. We treat our colleagues and partners with respect and dignity, and we do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind. It is as simple as that.
In 2020, we have addressed these issues
in our organisation and clarified how we deal with them. We have clear policies in place and a whistleblower system with a range of reporting options.
For Maersk, 2020 was a year of crises in global health and economies, lockdowns, closed borders and distress – but also of new opportunities for our company, accelerated progress towards our strategic goals and a chance to see what we as leaders and our employees are truly capable of.
In the coming year we will be applying our capacity to the global distribution of vaccines and to keeping supply chains open, and as such we will continue to play our part in enabling open, inclusive and sustainable trade – together.
Søren Skou
CEO of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S
our CEO
2020 was year of contrasts. While the pace of modern life slowed down due to restrictions
or lockdowns, trends and change agendas on digitisation and sustainability accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. While some industries came to a sudden halt others surged. And while lives and livelihoods were lost at tragic rates, human ingenuity and adaptability rose to new heights.
Even though borders closed, air traffic stopped and roads blocked across the globe, global supply chains remained open. The geographical presence and leadership position of A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk) enabled
us to find new ways of keeping essential goods moving for customers and societies,
as they kept businesses running and fought the virus. Just as we in our company focused on protecting our employees, who play an instrumental role in moving global trade while dealing with long shifts at sea and disruptive, new routines on shore. I remain tremendously proud to experience how we responded to
this global emergency by showing resilience,
innovation and a natural willingness to care for colleagues, serve customers and help society respond and recover. I am at the same time saddened by the fact that the COVID-19 virus has claimed the lives of some of our colleagues.
Sustainability as a fully integrated
business priority
Even as the urgent priorities of the pandemic and our business transformation have kept us busy, sustainability remains at the top of our agenda, and we continue our commitment and support for the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. We see an acceleration in expectations from all stakeholders, not least customers, investors and employees. In 2020,
we updated our sustainability priorities to further integrate sustainability into our business strategy, and we are accelerating our efforts to decarbonise shipping.
The pandemic has only reinforced our role in multiplying the benefits of trade and in making these accessible to all so that more people and businesses can be part of a global, open

  A.P. Moller - Maersk's (Maersk) approach to sustainability is to take responsibility in line with our values and commitments, and to assume a leadership position on global issues where we have the necessary competencies and leverage to make a real difference. We do this through our business activities and in line with our business strategy, while we listen carefully to stakeholders' expectations.
In 2020, this approach has led us to reassess and elevate our ambitions on sustainability, which are now further integrated in our Global Integrator strategy and the transformation of Maersk to one company.
We see continued strong momentum on the sustainability and ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) agenda in society as the expectations and ambition levels of our customers, investors, regulators and civil
society continue to rise. This impacts not only Maersk, but importantly also our customers, who are converting the expectations, risks and opportunities for sustainable products in the consumer market into requirements for us
to deliver decarbonised and increasingly also end-to-end responsible supply chain solutions. Almost three out of four of our key clients seriously consider sustainability in their supply chains, and 90 of our top 200 customers have set or are in the process of setting ambitious science-based or zero carbon targets.
ESG is moving from the niche confines of socially responsible investments to a focus
on financially material impacts that matter to mainstream investors. The financial community expects companies to demonstrate a credible plan that aligns with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5-degree target across the full supply chain,
and to take into account the physical effects of climate change and secure a viable business for the future.
Furthermore, lawmakers – particularly the
EU – are moving rapidly on legislation related
to sustainability, also on issues beyond climate change and decarbonisation. For example, the EU is enacting the taxonomy on sustainable activities, which through demands on the financial community will push requirements
for transparency on ESG data across business sectors. Further initiatives are in the EU's pipeline, including increased reporting obligations, ensuring sustainability in corporate governance and not least, mandatory social and environmental due diligence in supply chains.
As a consequence, sustainability is becoming not only a values-based responsibility for us but also a commercial and strategic imperative for

 Responsible business practices
 Maersk as part of our proposition to customers, capital providers, employees and regulators, and foundational to our broader societal licence to operate.
Defining a sustainable business strategy
Our sustainability efforts have matured over the last decade with increasing ambitions matching the maturity of the field and expectations of our leading customers and key stakeholders. The sustainability strategy and ambitions we defined in 2017 have served well in creating positive impact along multiple dimensions.
We have made significant progress on the four shared value priorities that we identified in 2017 as those where Maersk has the strongest potential to contribute towards the Sustainable Development Goals, leveraging our business
expertise and assets: decarbonising logistics, multiplying the benefits of trade, contributing to halving food loss, and leading change in the ship recycling industry. We have progressively embedded responsibility for sustainability implementation into core functions and business areas, and we are now ready to integrate our sustainability priorities as an embedded part of our business strategy.
In 2020, we have defined updated sustainability priorities for the Global Integrator strategy: Enabling sustainable trade by decarbonising logistics, sustainability in our end-to-end offerings and responsible business practices.
• We will take leadership on decarbonising logistics as our single most important strategic sustainability priority.
• We will increase our focus on end-to-end sustainability in our offerings in response to the increased responsibility and opportunity to manage supply chain risks for our customers as part of our Global Integrator business strategy.
• We continue to ensure responsible business practices across our operations with clear governance, accountability, and transparency on policies, commitments and performance.
Our commitments on inclusive trade and
food loss are fully owned and driven in line of business, and remain part of our reporting on sustainability as they are integral to our strategy and what we do as a business. Responsible
ship recycling is also fully owned in line of
the business and part of ensuring responsible business practices.

Introduction Strategic sustainability priorities Responding to a pandemic Responsible business practices Progress overview Data and assurance 11
Governance structures in place
Governance of sustainability in Maersk is
overall anchored with the Board of Directors (Transformation and Innovation Committee) and the Executive Leadership Team. Under
their oversight, our sustainability governance and integration approach secures executive ownership of sustainability and involvement
in setting sustainability priorities and driving implementation, while also embedding sustainability in core processes related to strategy, performance, planning and risk management.
In 2020, we revised the governance structure on decarbonising logistics to support an acceleration of our efforts. This includes
an expanded steering committee with two executive members serving as an accountable decision-making forum, supported by a broader decarbonisation advisory group, preparing work plans and strategies and ensuring alignment across the company. The advisory group
has defined a set of workstreams covering commercialisation, vessel design, energy efficiency, fleet and network, retrofitting, new fuels, sourcing and framework conditions.
Stakeholder engagement
Five stakeholder groups are prioritised
for sustainability strategy, reporting and engagement: customers, employees, investors, authorities and NGOs/thought leaders. Issue owners and leaders across Maersk engage with representatives of these groups as part of their
Key partnerships
We remain engaged in a wide range of partnerships
daily work, and we incorporate feedback from the regular engagements in determining the materiality of sustainability issues and setting strategic direction for our work.
In 2020, our engagement with customers
on sustainability has focused particularly on providing transparency on responsible business practices and visibility of logistics emissions,
as well as on sustainability innovation, encompassing our currently available and future solutions for net zero carbon shipping. Our engagement with investors, banks and insurers on ESG/sustainability has likewise centred on decarbonisation, but ship recycling, air emissions, ocean health and safety are also topics important to our large investors.
We engage actively in many partnerships on key sustainability topics (see overview below). In addition, we are active members of industry organisations such as Danish Shipping and the World Shipping Council.
Materiality: Working on issues that matter
In line with our practice of reviewing materiality annually, we have updated our overview of material sustainability issues drawing on the outcome of stakeholder engagement and research conducted as part of the update of strategic sustainability priorities. The research has provided insights into expectations, leading practices and emerging topics across customers, investors, and broader society, and has added
to our existing knowledge and analyses
from previous years including an analysis of how Maersk relates to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Revisions and additions to our model
We are simplifying our representation of material issues to reflect our new strategic approach, highlighting the issues that are strategic imperatives and hold the greatest potential for value creation: decarbonisation, end-to-end sustainability in our offerings, and sustainable trade. Furthermore, we continue to be guided by the perspective of double materiality in determining how sustainability issues may constitute responsibilities or risks, enabling us to understand where Maersk has a responsibility to mitigate potential negative impact on society or the environment and where issues may pose significant risk to
our business.
Our disclosure of sustainability issues as
potential risks to our business draws on our enterprise risk management process, which assesses top risks to achieving our business plan within a 5-year horizon. The sustainability issues that are assessed as among our top
risks are safety (failure to ensure the safety
and security of our employees), climate change (failure to decarbonise our end-to-end supply chain at a speed that matches our customers’ and investors’ expectations), and anti-corruption (being involved in a large compliance case).
Material sustainability issues 2020
Based on research, stakeholder dialogue and management prioritisation, we determine how sustainability issues are material to Maersk by applying criteria and filters of risk, responsibility and strategic opportunity assessment. The most material issues are outlined below and reported on in relevant sections of this report.

Changes to reporting as a result of strategy and materiality review
Our commitments to open, inclusive and sustainable trade are owned in line of business and delivered in particular through strategic investments in digitising global trade. We continue to report on our 2025 commitments as well as on key societal trends in global trade.
Air emissions continue to be a material responsibility topic, while the potential financial risk impact of IMO 2020 (lack of enforcement of the cap on sulphur in fuel oil) as reported on in previous years is reduced.
Supply chain sustainability risk is becoming more strategically relevant for us in our customer offerings. We report on it in the chapter on end-to-end sustainability in our offerings.
We no longer report on food loss as a separate disclosure topic but incorporate highlights in this year’s report as part of the chapter on sustainable trade.
Responsible ship recycling continues to be a material responsibility topic which we report on in the responsible business practices section.
We no longer report on human rights as a separate issue, but have integrated human rights commitments and frameworks such as the UN guiding principles on human rights and business into our governance approach and issue management processes. See overview to the right.
Human rights in this report
There are many aspects of our business that touch on human rights. Commitment to human rights

Enabling
sustainable trade
As the global integrator of container logistics, we work to ensure that trade is open, inclusive and sustainable.
Wherever you live, chances are that your living conditions are closely tied to how much and how well your country trades. Since 1980, Bangladesh has seen a four-fold increase in exports with poverty rates declining from 45% to less than 15% today1. In South Korea, another trading nation, an average employee generates 13 times more wealth in a day than she did fifty years ago2. In Turkey, the typical consumer can attribute a third of their real income to lower prices enabled by trade3.
Lessons from a pandemic
During 2020, we saw how fragile this progress can be – a real-time demonstration of what
can happen when economies shut down.
The International Labour Organization has estimated that as a result of the pandemic, global labour incomes have declined by more than 10% in 2020, corresponding to hundreds of millions of jobs4. The economic hardships caused by COVID-19 are not equally distributed, and inequalities within and among countries are likely to widen. According to the World Bank, during the pandemic the number of people living in extreme poverty (less than USD 1.90
a day) has gone up for the first time in twenty years and there is a real risk that we will not reach the UN Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 20305.
At the same time, 2020 also demonstrated the power of open trade and well-designed logistics. The pandemic has been a demand- side crisis, but bar the initial shut-down in China, and initial shortages of face masks, it has not been a supply-side crisis. Logistics supply chains have kept moving throughout the pandemic.
Three factors in particular explain why this has been the case. First, the extraordinary
efforts of those on the frontline that make trade move: seafarers, dockworkers, warehouse staff, truck drivers and many more. Throughout the crisis, they have kept supply chains moving. For our seafarers and their families this has come at great personal sacrifice (see p. 26).
Second, the investments we have made
into operational excellence, expansion of our portfolio of services and new digital solutions over the past years have made supply chains much more resilient. Comparing 2020 to 2019, the Maersk App nearly doubled the number
of business transactions – from an average of about 21,400 per week in 2019 to an average
of about 42,600 per week in 2020. Similarly, business transactions on Maersk.com – one of the world’s largest B2B-sites – are up by 18% year on year. As the pandemic disrupted the global economy, our strategic focus on building end-to-end supply chain visibility helped our customers slow down, speed up and redirect supply as shut-downs rolled through global markets. Third, governments have on the whole consciously worked to keep trade open in order to preserve jobs and economic activity, enabling logistics companies to do their job.
Using trade to drive recovery
The learnings that helped us during the crisis will also be essential for the rebuild that lies ahead. Open, inclusive and sustainable trade should be at the centre of this effort.
Much attention has been focused on the US-China trade war, but trade protectionism has been on the rise among all the G20 economies since the 2009 global financial crisis, and
US and China account for no more than a quarter of protectionist measures since 2017. This we can no longer afford. The removal
of protectionist measures can offer a multi- billion-dollar stimulus to the global economy without burdening taxpayers and public finances.
The pandemic has been particularly hard on small and medium-sized businesses that account for two-thirds of all jobs globally. Boosting their access to trade is critical for an inclusive recovery. Furthermore, helping SMEs grow and diversify their export markets will make them and the millions who depend on them more resilient to future crises.
 Live demonstration of the power of trade
It is tempting to think that in an uncertain world, decoupling supply chains and increasing protectionism and self- sufficiency is the way to go. 2020 has demonstrated just how flawed this strategy is.
It is because of open supply chains, digital connectivity and rules-based trade that countries and businesses have been able to maintain essential services and supplies, even as half the global population went into lockdown.
But while global supply chains are essential during the crisis and for the recovery, going forward it will not be business as usual. The increased need
for resilience experienced during the pandemic adds to an already existing
set of factors, including technological innovations and geopolitics that are transforming supply chains. We expect that resilience, redundancy and scalability will play a bigger role for our customers, with more focus on the geographic diversity and resilience of suppliers, stress-testing supply chain networks, and 'just-in-case' inventory management.

Maersk is committed to
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The aim of the collaboration is to develop ASYHUB,
a digital hub that will allow customs administrations globally to exchange digital shipping information with platforms such as TradeLens, an open and neutral supply chain platform developed by Maersk and IBM. The ASYHUB solution will enable customs to
have greater visibility of goods entering and leaving their countries, while drastically cutting down on the time and cost for importers and exporters to clear their goods. Development of the solution was completed in 2020 and it will be tested by customs authorities in Cambodia and Sri Lanka during 2021.
The link between trade and climate change
We recognise that concerns over the sustainability of global consumption patterns remain and that in the light of the pandemic, this debate has come to include the added dilemma of jobs and livelihoods lost in production countries in particular.
Our premise is that fighting climate change should not be at the expense of trade, because this will lead to another set of sustainability challenges: lack of decent work, increases in poverty, hunger, lower availability of funds
to invest in sustainable transformation and new infrastructure and more. As the past year has shown us, keeping trade up and running positively impacts the chances of sustainability staying on the global agenda.
Maersk is best positioned to impact two aspects of making trade and consumption more sustainable: by ensuring access to trade by removing friction in trade as explained
above, and decarbonising logistics, described in detail on pages 16-22, which will result in the decoupling of greenhouse gas emissions during transportation from economic growth.
Decarbonising logistics is only one part of the sustainability challenge related to consumption, but it is the one which we are able to impact directly, as opposed to consumption of natural resources, build-up of non-recyclable waste, etc., which are issues that must first be dealt with in the systems where they occur.
In simple terms, we are working to decarbonise how container cargo is moved around the world. The sustainability of what is inside the container is not within our direct sphere of influence, and must as a starting point be dealt with by the cargo owners.
Minimising food loss with customers
We are helping to halve food loss during transportation as an integrated part of our Cold Chain Logistics business, focusing on developing and scaling solutions to connect and integrate our customers' cold chains. Substantial extra
efforts were required during 2020 to minimise disruptions brought on by COVID-19 and ensure all elements across the cold chains including cold stores and trucking could continue to run smoothly, and ensure the stability of global food supply.
During 2020, the Cold Chain Logistics area expanded and now serves several hundred customers across nearly 50 countries globally. We opened one new cold chain facility and are progressing on three construction or expansion projects to develop our network of cold storage warehouses.
We work with customers to test solutions that target produce at the origin, working from harvest to container station and beyond to ensure that the product is treated in the best possible way to sustain quality and secure as little food loss as possible. One such example is how we have worked with citrus growers
in Morocco, where preservation of food
quality in citrus fruit during transportation was challenging. Our work included quality- preserving processes related to packing,
handling and temperature control in the
cold chain resulting in less food loss, as well
as working with customs to ensure faster processing, which equals less waste and better prices for the farmers. We piloted this project in 2019, and in 2020 we have worked to scale it up to cover more farmers and more destinations.
Maersk also contributes to reducing
food loss both during transportation and at supermarket and consumer level through investments made by our venture arm, Maersk Growth. These include investments in for example Fliit, a Germany-based digital freight forwarder specializing in food logistics, Ripe.io – a platform leveraging blockchain technology and AI to provide data insights along the food supply chain, and Spoiler Alert, a company building a marketplace for discounted perishables.
Our focus during 2020 has been on efforts to create change on the ground, and the development of a metrics framework and broader partnerships to guide and document our impact on food loss in the supply chain remains a work-in-progress.

Delivering on our commitments
Through Twill, our digital logistics offering
for small and medium-sized customers,
and Maersk Growth, A.P. Moller - Maersk’s (Maersk) corporate venture arm, we pursue our commitment to connecting 100,000 SMEs, including women-operated business,
to international trade by 2025. As part of this work, we recognise that trade finance is one of the key barriers to trade for small businesses, and for this reason we have invested in MODIFI, which specialises in making trade finance

accessible to small companies. In 2020, we integrated MODIFI’s offering into Twill.
Women-owned businesses and women entrepreneurs hold particular promise in making trade work better for inclusive growth. In 2020, we continued our collaboration with the SheTrades initiative of the International Trade Centre, with the aim of connecting more women to trade.
As shippers, logistics providers, customs officers and many more supply chain actors have been holed up at home around the world, digital platforms have enabled them to keep operations moving. Maersk is committed to helping connect 50% of global containerised trade to digital solutions by 2025. The potential impact of reaching this target was demonstrated in an analysis of our terminal in Mumbai in India concluded in 2019. This showed that digitising trade processes can help reduce costs for exporters and importers by up to USD 260 million annually in Mumbai alone, equal to approximately 15% of total costs.
Our aim is to help realise this potential on
a global scale. In 2019, Maersk entered into an innovative partnership with the Government of Germany and the United Nations Conference

TradeLens involvement in a multi-stakeholder project to automate advance sea cargo data for developing countries will start with pilots in Cambodia and Sri Lanka.
• Twill, our digital shipping platform focused on SMEs, counted over 4,000 active customers in 2020.
• Almost 1.700 participants joined Twill's webinars and coaching programmes.
• By the end of 2020, we had invested in 21 start-ups enabling trade for SMEs. These start-ups reach more than 15,000
customers and help them connect to global trade.
Through our participation in the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, we provide knowledge and data to enable reforms in developing countries.
By the end of 2020, we had contributed to reforms in ten countries. Action was delayed on a number of projects, predominantly due to COVID-19.
In 2020 our Cold Chain Logistics business expanded to cover several hundred customers across nearly 50 countries globally. We opened one new cold chain facility and are progressing three construction/expansion projects in our network of cold storage warehouses. The fundamental challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has been to help ensure the stability of global food supply.
We did not make progress in 2020 on the development of a metrics framework and broader partnerships to guide and document our impact on food loss in the supply chain.
6 We no longer report on a previous target on SME share of Maersk revenue because we have come to understand that their overall share of Maersk revenue does not contribute to providing meaningful measures of the impact on our work.
          Twill employees coach women entrepreneurs
As part of Twill’s collaboration with ITC SheTrades, we organise coaching programmes between Twill employees and representatives of SMEs. In 2020,
a pilot programme of four weeks and a subsequent eight week-long programme were established to support a total of 29 women entrepreneurs from Nigeria, India, Mexico and Kenya. The business owners were allocated a Twill coach, and the pairs worked on predefined challenges experienced
by the business and communicated in advance. These were not only logistics challenges, but also addressed questions related to sales, e-commerce, HR and marketing.
19 of the 25 participants in the eight week programme took part in a follow-up, and a full 94% of these reported that the programme would
enable them to change their operations to increase their competitiveness in international trade.
This is the case for Rocio Aslida Norzagaray Sandoval, co-owner and CEO of Dios Cacao in Mexico, producing and selling gourmet chocolate products, promoting the consumption of Mexican cocoa and on a mission to improve crops and support the social fabric of communities in their supply chain.
Rocio Sandoval came into the coaching programme with a desire to expand Dios Cacao's market beyond Mexico, but declaring that she did not know where to start and would like help to understand what the company’s target audience and pricing strategy might be when trying to expand.
At the end of the eight weeks, Rocio and her Twill coach, Maria Fernanda Muniz Tapia, agreed
that good knowledge about the export process in Mexico had been achieved and a pricing strategy established. Furthermore, Rocio and Maria had worked on Dios Cacao’s supply chain and designed an export plan based on actual quotes and risks.
“Thank you for the fortune of being part of this programme. I now feel more capable in dealing with future challenges, “ Rocio Sandoval wrote to Twill at the end of the programme.
The Twill employees working as coaches were equally enthusiastic about taking part in the project. A full 95% reported that they had increased their understanding of SMEs and their pain points, while 86% increased their understanding of developing markets, and 100% felt that they had improved their interpersonal skills.

Decarbonising logistics
Decarbonisation is a strategic imperative for our industry and our company. We are intensifying our efforts to achieve net zero emissions and support our customers to decarbonise their supply chains.
Two years after setting our net zero ambition
in December 2018, we have come further than we imagined possible at that time.
In 2018, a 2050 net zero ambition for shipping was a moonshot goal. Today, we see it as a challenging target, but clearly possible to reach. Customers, investors and authorities are accelerating their ambitions, and their expectations are rising fast for A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk) and our industry to deliver more solutions, more visibility and more help in decarbonising supply chains.
Decarbonisation can make or break us
In 2020, we conducted a strategic review of global climate scenarios and transition pathways (see box on page 21). The conclusion was that climate action is a strategic imperative for all companies, and our company in particular, as we – due to our size and industry reach – have the opportunity to be a driving force in decarbonising shipping and logistics. We are both able and willing to take that role upon us.
There are specific trends in our stakeholder environment that underscore the need for urgent action on decarbonisation. First, a logistics provider without an ambitious plan for decarbonisation risks becoming irrelevant in the market, because it would become increasingly difficult for customers to embed services offered into their product offerings. This means that our company cannot be behind the curve on the carbon journey.
Second, political action is gradually but continuously beginning to reflect the reality of climate change. Spurred on by science, the evident rise in the number of extreme weather events, as well as pressure from a broad range of stakeholders, lawmakers are working on taxation or other pricing mechanisms as well as disclosure requirements related to CO2 emissions, to incentivise transformation in all parts of society. These actions both emphasise and potentially mitigate the financial risks of climate change to companies, asset owners and societies. For example, while Maersk supports the introduction of uniform pricing regimes for CO2, the potential added cost from a regulatory instrument such as a carbon tax might end up being calculated in billions of dollars for Maersk alone, if we do not decarbonise our operations.

Introduction Strategic sustainability priorities Responding to a pandemic Responsible business practices Progress overview Data and assurance 19
Maersk has a history of pioneering solutions and being ahead of our customers' demand. We were first to create a global network driving down the cost of transporting goods. We are the frontrunners in digitising the shipping and logistics industry with blockchain and web- based solutions.
Our decarbonisation efforts have matured over the past decade with increasing ambitions matching the maturity of the field and the expectations of our leading customers. We now want to reinforce our position, and we see this as an expression of our obligation – as an industry leader and with the resources available to us – to do all we can to get to a carbon- neutral fleet as fast as possible and to help
our customers decarbonise their global supply chains end to end.
Today, 90 of our top 200 customers have set or are in the process of setting ambitious science-based or zero carbon targets. We have since 2018 been committed to set a science- based target, and we are actively engaging with the Science-Based Target Initiative on developing a methodology for shipping. Once this work is finalised, expected in the first
half of 2021, we want to relate our emission reduction targets to this new calculation method, and measure our performance by the same yardstick as our customers do.
Intensifying our efforts
To be true to our history and strategic promise, we are in the process of reviewing our decarbonisation ambitions, and investigating where we can raise the bar. To drive this
and coordinate all related processes, a new Decarbonisation function was launched in January 2021, tasked with ensuring collaboration across commercial, operational, technological,
"Our conversations with customers are increasingly focused on supporting their ambitions to decarbonise their supply chains, and ensuring flexible and resilient transport solutions."

and corporate entities. With the new setup, decarbonisation will be an even stronger strategic priority across the business. The new team, counting more than 50 people, will assist, inspire, set the direction and transition pace and ensure that decarbonisation is a business priority embedded across the entire company.
In pursuit of the decarbonisation targets set in 2018, we continue to make progress along the strategic pathways of building markets, developing technologies and enabling policies.
Launched in 2019, Maersk ECO Delivery remains one of only a few options for carbon-neutral emissions shipping on the global market so far.
A market for net zero emissions shipping
Building on the increased momentum from our customers, in 2020 we implemented a new commercial strategy on sustainability aiming to respond to and aid customers on their decarbonisation journey, however far they have come.
One key feature in this is the Maersk ECO Delivery product. Launched in 2019, it remains one of only a few options for carbon-neutral emissions shipping on the global market so far.
Maersk ECO delivery uses externally certified biodiesel in the form of used cooking oil to power vessels in our network. The CO2 savings generated from this are used to neutralise emissions related to transport of specific cargo by customers.
In 2020, customer uptake of Maersk ECO delivery shipping exceeded our expectations. So far, approximately ten major customers have chosen to purchase this carbon-neutral emissions
transport solution, and we expect this number
to increase. We are also in conversation with some customers on the possibility of converting all their shipments to the Maersk ECO delivery product. While this is very promising, it represents a small share of the total amount of containers transported by Maersk, and we need much more customer demand to scale net zero emissions offerings and enable a transition to full decarbonisation.
Most importantly, however, we are learning that the commoditised freight market is open for price differentiation related to sustainability. Driven by the end-consumers' increased willingness to pay for sustainability, and growing climate urgency, this represents a solid contribution to the development of a business model for decarbonised logistics and transport, lowering the risk we take on when investing in the development of decarbonised logistics and transport services (shipping, rail, road, air).
Reflecting this, we have developed a multi- tier value proposition for sustainable logistics, allowing us to respond to customer needs aligned with their maturity and ambition level for carbon reductions. We continue to build ties and partnerships with the group of customers who match or exceed our ambitions on decarbonisation, and the solutions we co-develop with them are crucial levers in showcasing and shaping the broader market
of the future.
A very relevant aspect related to the value proposition of net zero emissions logistics is understanding where the cost of transition will be felt. Analysis from the Energy Transitions Commission7 shows that for most product categories, price increases for final consumers will be negligible, even though the intermediate costs are higher. See graphic below.
Four priority fuels for net zero emissions shipping
  Fuel
Biodiesel
Methanol
(bio-methanol and e-methanol)
Lignin fuels
A new biofuel based on biomass residue (lignin) and alcohols (methanol or ethanol)
Ammonia
(green ammonia)
The future of fuels
Over the past two years, we have conducted an extensive analysis of the available technology and fuel options for net zero carbon operations. Based on this work, we have concluded that there are technologies that are mature enough for us to participate in their development to scale by acting as an ambitious customer.
A broad range of technologies were evaluated and the four primary pathways we are now pursuing can be seen in the table above. As part of this process, we also de- selected a number of potential technologies. For example, bio-methane and liquified natural gas, fuel cells, nuclear and onboard carbon capture due to concerns related to one or more of the steps in the fuel transformation supply chain (see illustration on the next page). For bio-methane and liquified natural gas, for example, we are very concerned with levels
of methane emissions, and the risk of tying investments to marginal CO2 reductions rather than transformation to real net zero-emissions solutions. Fuel cells were put on hold because they are not ready to be produced efficiently at scale and cost is still high, but we monitor this technology closely.
Our analysis shows that the technologies
are available. As a result, and in response
to the increased urgency of delivering on decarbonisation, we believe that the right thing to do is to leapfrog to pure net zero vessel technology without any transitional technologies.
Key advantages
• Can be used as drop-in fuel in existing vessels and engines
• Already in operation as marine fuel • Engine is available
• Liquid at normal conditions,
well-known handling
• Lignin fuels are potentially the most price-competitive net zero fuel with the lowest price estimate almost on a par with fossil fuels
• Fully zero emissions fuel
• Can be produced at scale from renewable
electricity alone
Barriers to progress
As shown in the graphic on the next page, fuel transformation involves the entire supply chain, and holds barriers to progress which we are working to overcome:
• Scaling fuel production and
associated technology
The main limitation to developing net zero emission vessels is availability of new fuels at scale. We are engaged in several fuel manufacturing projects for both methanol and ammonia, just as our participation in
the LEO coalition continues, where we in collaboration with partners incl. customers and researchers work on the lignin fuel option in the table above. In combination, these projects will deliver substantially towards the power needs of our entire fleet, albeit price premiums may remain a barrier to uptake. The first green fuel projects will command premiums, but technology maturity will improve and production costs are expected to decrease once production is scaled.
• Lack of fuel infrastructure
Today, there is very limited infrastructure in any port to handle net zero emission fuels.
Key limitations/risks
• Limited availability of biomass feedstock a challenge to scalability
• Price pressure due to high demand from competing industries
• Bio-methanol: Production at scale is challenged by uncertainty over availability of biomass
• E-methanol: Availability of biogenic CO2 source at production site, cost and maturity of electrolyser technology
• In development stage, production needs to be scaled up to create a new value chain and infrastructure for supply
• Engine requirements would be the same as for methanol, but additional handling of contaminants may be required
• Safety and toxicity challenges
• Infrastructure challenges at ports
• Future cost depends on cost of renewable electricity and
cost/maturity of electrolyser technology
          How decarbonisation affects consumer prices
20% increase in shipping rate
We will collaborate with fuel suppliers to develop a fuelling network that serves our needs.
• Safety-related issues
For methanol and ethanol, there are issues related to flammability that will have to be resolved. There are already some operational experience available for methanol as a shipping fuel. For ammonia, the main issue
is toxicity, and safe solutions will have to be developed before it can be used as marine fuel. However, ammonia is today handled commercially in many other applications, and solutions for its safe use as marine fuel should be possible. Much work remains to be done in this area, and it is one of the areas that the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping will investigate (see box on the next page).
• Impact on company profitability Leadership on the decarbonisation agenda comes with a near-certain increase in costs but also, we believe, with a potential for competitive advantage that far outweighs the costs and potential risks.

The need for broad-based action
The final piece of our decarbonisation strategy relates to the policy frameworks established to further this process. Policies must not
only secure that low performers are held accountable, but also that the first movers are truly rewarded for the risks taken on behalf of the whole industry.
With very few exceptions, the political and legislative debate is currently not moving
fast enough to fulfil its role. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) must start to address concrete long-term measures in order to close the competitiveness gap between fossil and renewable fuels. Global measures
to accelerate the transition and create a more level playing field are essential, and for this reason the limited outcome of the IMO meeting in 2020 was disappointing. We also advocate that lawmakers build incentive structures that reward first movers and remove a share of the financial risk related to decarbonisation. There is a very real danger that regulators are out of sync with the progress and development pushed by industry, which would be to no one’s benefit.
At regional level, there is no doubt that shipping will be part of the EU Emissions Trading System, which is the world's biggest scheme for trading
greenhouse gas emissions allowances, also known as CO2 credits. However, this needs
to be done with the objective of actually lowering shipping emissions and with a view
to supporting an international greenhouse
gas reduction agreement. Moreover, the many related EU initiatives must also fit into a puzzle whereby greenhouse gas emissions overall are lowered while still supporting modal shift of cargo to sea, which will remain the most sustainable way of transporting large quantities of cargo.
The transition will not happen without strong regulatory frameworks. IMO Member States have a fundamental role in securing progress. These processes take time, but there is real benefit to having a global solution which is enforceable and protects first-movers.
In parallel, private action and advocacy initiatives should also continue. We are very proud to have been part of the recent launch
of the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping (see box). This independent centre will engage scientists from all over the world in trying to find solutions on fuels for shipping. Additionally, we have joined hands with Ørsted, the largest energy company in Denmark, and other leading Danish companies in establishing a project to develop a new hydrogen plant, which can be part of the solution for creating e-fuels in the future. We have also received external funding to further intensify our research and development of different types of lignin-alcohol fuels. We continue to engage actively in the Getting to Zero coalition, and beyond our own sector we have joined
with a group of other leadership companies in the Transform to Net Zero initiative, launched
in July 2020, which aims to lead by example, developing guidance and pilot projects to enable all businesses to achieve net zero emissions.
Progress and increased disclosure
on CO2 efficiency
Our target is to deliver 60% relative CO2 reduction by 2030 (compared to 2008 baseline). By the end of 2020, we had reduced emissions by 46.3%. We are from 2020 using an improved methodology to calculate relative reductions, which enhances the accuracy8.
We are also from 2020 disclosing our progress on CO2 efficiency in both actual efficiency (measured in EEOI, gCO2/ton-nm) as well as relative to our baseline year 2008. The graphs above show performance according to both the old calculation, used in our 2019 Sustainability Report, and the improved calculation which we will use going forward.
Comparing the new calculations with the
old shows that while the number for actual efficiency in gCO2/ton-nm is now higher than before, this also corresponds to a higher reduction compared to the baseline year of 2008. Using the old methodology, we have reduced emissions by 42.7% since 2008.

 The Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping
The Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping is an independent, non-profit, leading-edge research and development centre launched in June 2020. Mobilising around 100 of the best minds from industry, academia, energy, fuel and ship technology, regulatory affairs and finance, the centre will work to create overviews of decarbonisation pathways, accelerate the development
of selected decarbonising energies and powering technologies as well as support the establishment of regulatory, financial and commercial means to enable and drive the transformation.
The centre is made possible by a start-up donation of DKK 400m by the A.P. Moller Foundation. The founding partners are American Bureau of Shipping, A.P. Moller - Maersk, Cargill, MAN Energy Solutions, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, NYK Lines and Siemens, and many more partners are expected to join.
 “We are looking for more robust and comparable information on how companies are realigning their business strategies and operations with the goals of the Paris Agreement and a net zero emissions future. We need to be certain that a company has charted a credible and comprehensive course to decarbonisation, taking into account added investments and costs, just as we need to know that the transformation is anchored at the highest leadership level.”

Senior Vice President, ATP
8 The indicator underlying our relative CO2 reduction target is EEOI, Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator, calculated as g CO2/(Ton x Nm). From 2020, we are disclosing performance in actual numbers in addition to
the progress relative to the index year 2008. Our new, improved methodology, enables us to cleanse ballast water and fuel stock weights from the cargo weight to make the calculation of EEOI fully in line with the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee's (MEPC) regulations. This was previously not possible, as we lacked the data and method to remove it from the historical data.
Climate-related risks and opportunities to our business
In 2020, we conducted a strategic review to analyse the likelihood and implications of different pathways for global warming, and how these might impact our business in terms of both physical and transition risks.
Limiting warming to 2.0 degrees appears to be the most plausible outcome. Reaching this goal will require significant policy measures and per capita emissions below the lowest level recorded since records began in 1960.
The physical effects of climate change are already evident in the form of heat and water stress, precipitation, storms, and rising sea levels. These effects will intensify regardless of collective action taken today to decarbonise.
Attaining a 2.0-degree pathway will not eliminate physical climate change risk for our customers and our business operations. Moreover, the transition to a 2.0-degree pathway will likely be a source of major disruption (transition risk) in and of itself because of the accompanying government
policies and changed consumption patterns. And a 2.0- degree pathway will entail ongoing material risk of accelerated climate change (tipping points) and abrupt policy changes in response.
Currently, the planet remains on an unsustainable warming pathway above 2.0 degrees and material physical climate change is likely regardless of remedial actions taken, impacting customer supply chains and potentially Maersk's ability to deliver a reliable product.
These scenarios confirm to us the urgency
of climate action to mitigate the risks to our own business and stay relevant in the market by supporting our customers to decarbonise their supply chains. Climate change, more specifically the risk of not decarbonising our end-to-end supply chain at a speed that matches our customers’ and investors’ expectations, was in 2020 confirmed by our executive leadership as one of the top enterprise risks to Maersk.
TCFD disclosure
It is a cornerstone of our decarbonisation ambition to provide transparency to capital markets on
greenhouse gas emissions across all scopes, our transition pathways, and climate-related risks and opportunities.
The key framework which guides our reporting is the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework which is also incorporated into CDP, a platform to which we have reported since 2010, and into new benchmarks such as the Climate Action 100+ net zero company benchmark launching in early 2021.
TCFD recommends that companies report
on governance, strategy, risk management, and targets and metrics related to material climate- related risks and opportunities. To understand our governance of climate change work please refer to page 10 in this report.
To learn about our strategy as well as metrics and targets for decarbonisation, please read this chapter of the report.

22 A.P. Moller - Maersk Sustainability Report 2020 Strategic sustainability priorities Decarbonising logistics
The main contributors to the 2.5% reduction in 2020 are related to a series of energy efficiency initiative. Retrofitting of our fleet, the further integration and use of Star Connect and improved utilisation of vessels.
Star Connect is a monitoring system being implemented on all our vessels to provide visibility on the efficiency of the engine and the most effective sea voyage, with live data helping crews adjust and choose the most efficient path forward. We are also implementing a more limited version of the system on chartered vessels.
Further efficiency improvements are dependent on a continued and enhanced energy efficiency drive, different fuel types, more modern vessels and technological advances.

As the graphic below shows, the vast majority of our emissions come from our own operations (scope 1), which are dominated by ocean transport. As we expand our activities on land this situation is bound to change. However, our plan for expansion on land does not include significant asset ownership, and consequently emissions from our logistics supply chain (scope 3) are set to grow.
We are exploring how best to engage
our suppliers in support of an end-to-end decarbonisation ambition, and we are working to expand our net zero solutions to customers to encompass offerings across end-to-end logistics, including trucking, rail and warehousing,
Maersk’s

as well as digital solutions to provide visibility on emissions end-to-end.
Our role in decarbonising logistics will be very different compared to our role in ocean transport, where Maersk holds a leadership position and is a significant asset owner in an industry dominated by relatively few, large companies. The inland logistics industry landscape is very different, and we typically have limited operational control of the assets such as trucks, trains, warehouses. This will imply a different, more collaborative, approach where we partner with our logistics suppliers to work towards decarbonisation of our end- to-end logistics offerings (scope 2 and scope 3, as well as the small portion of our scope 1 emissions outside ocean transport).
As part of this, we are working towards integrating environmental sustainability into procurement criteria in tenders.

Sustainability
in our end-to-end
offerings
Managing all aspects of our customers' logistics supply chains includes taking on responsibility for sustainability performance. We are developing a more comprehensive approach to ensuring sustainable practices across our end-to-end offerings.
In 2016, we launched our Global Integrator strategy of connecting and simplifying our customers’ supply chains. Since then, we have transformed A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk) to a focused and integrated global logistics company.
Working with sustainability in logistics is a different challenge from that of decarbonising container shipping which is dominated by major market players, of which we are one of the largest. In contrast, the logistics industry is fragmented with its thousands of suppliers of trucking, warehousing, manning agencies, rail services etc. For example, Maersk works with more than 3,000 suppliers of trucking services.
As we grow our logistics business, we are determined to apply our commitment to responsible business practices, our willingness to use the leverage of our business to affect change – by ourselves alone and through partnerships – and our ambitions of decarbonising our business and enabling open, inclusive and sustainable trade.
We have investigated the implications of the Global Integrator strategy on sustainability- related risks, opportunities and responsibilities. One conclusion is that our exposure to risks on
social issues, anti-corruption, environment and CO2 emissions grow substantially as we take our business on land. This includes risks of corruption and working conditions – including safety challenges – for workers not hired by us, but working for us.
It is clear to us that our customers expect their logistics supplier to ensure responsible practices, and expect us to help them address their supply chain challenges on emissions and
waste (read more on decarbonising end-to-end on the left).
Our investigations led us to conclude that while we have a good foundation of responsible business practices within our own operations on which we can build, our set-up can be improved for delivering on the expectations to our customers, and the approach going forward will be integrated across functions and into our product offerings as a base component.
“Responsible practices in our supply chain are important for maintaining our societal license to operate. We require our suppliers to live up to international standards on responsible business conduct, and this is equally important in transportation and logistics as it is in our factories and raw materials supply. When we hand over our logistics needs from end-to-end to an external party,
we are looking for a logistics partner who can ensure responsibility and ultimately support positive societal and environmental impact in our logistics supply chain.”

 Better oversight of contract labour in African ports
In 2020, we investigated working conditions for contracted labourers in ports on the African continent. We focused on ports where Maersk vessels call, but which are not owned by us.
This broader investigation was the result of unacceptable working conditions first reported
by a Danish NGO in the port of Mombasa in 2019, which had found use 24-hour shifts with minimal breaks, to pay wages below the Kenyan hourly minimum wage and to lack provision of safety equipment for workers. This is not acceptable to us.
Local Maersk staff reviewed the practices of all the suppliers used for contracting labour
in third-party operated ports in Africa and compared these to our supplier code of conduct. In most cases there were minor gaps which were addressed through improvement plans.
However, most of the contracted labourers working in these ports are hired by the port operators, and we have little insight into the content of their contracts.
Recognising that this is a high-risk area for ports, we are working to develop new audit and follow-up regimes to ensure our standards are met.
 Responding
to a pandemic
Facing the global emergency of 2020, Maersk's priorities were to protect our people, serve our customers and support society.
 Improving working conditions for truck drivers
We are active participants in the Responsible Trucking project run by CSR Europe, which focuses on enabling better working conditions for truck drivers in the EU.
In 2020, the project drafted a set of social guidelines that set out minimum standards, which serves as a public stance from private organisations in support of better working conditions for truck drivers, and at the same time addresses the specific challenges this profession faces.
Spot check tools and methodologies were also created for the group to use to understand the challenges on the ground, and for companies to have an indication of the extent to which these challenges are present in their own supply chain.
The guidelines will be published 2021, after which implementation of tools can begin.

    Comprehensive plan for the future
Applying a customer perspective on responsible practices in our supply chain, we are developing a comprehensive work programme to deliver the necessary changes and improvements to our current practices across environmental, social and governance issues.
We will use the levers most readily available to us to create impact. That includes:
• Strengthening our procurement digital
landscape to enable the end-to-end supplier
performance monitoring.
• Defining the ambition level for responsibility
and sustainability in our products.
• Engaging our customers on risks in their
logistics supply chain.
• Collaborating across the industry to
set standards and share cost of driving improvements.
These efforts will also help us prepare both
for our own operations and to support our customers to comply with upcoming regulation on mandatory social and environmental due diligence in various national jurisdictions and from the EU. We welcome legislation at the EU
level, applying to all businesses above a certain size that have activities with in the EU, because this provides a far more level playing field.
The opposite, which is further proliferation of national regulation, we believe will fall short of solving the problems it is designed to alleviate.
Going forward, we can leverage our experience from our extensive work on decarbonisation of and reducing air emissions from shipping. On these issues, Maersk has been instrumental in standard setting for CO2 emissions, customer engagement through product development ahead of the market, and collaboration in alliances such as Clean Cargo, the Trident Alliance and the Getting to Zero coalition.
Due to the fragmented nature of the logistics industry, we foresee a road to change consisting of many, comparatively smaller initiatives attacking the challenges bit by bit.
Wheels already in motion
We have begun to take action in key areas. One example is the development of a collaborative approach to improve the monitoring of supplier compliance related to depot services, warehousing and trucking. This approach will be tested and rolled out globally in 2021, and sees our
Responsible Procurement team carrying out due diligence in accordance with our Supplier Code of Conduct prior to the signing of a contract, while local Customer Experience and Health, Safety, Security and Environment teams carry out onsite audits for the duration of the contract.
Furthermore, in all land-based activities we have contracted labour hired through thirdparty providers. We are working to enhance our management of risks related to this workforce. Because while the companies responsible
for these workers sign our Supplier Code of Conduct, we are not satisfied with our controls for compliance in areas such as health and safety, wages, social security or insurance and working hours.
Finally, while due diligence and onboarding procedures are already part of our Responsible Procurement programme, we are taking steps to strengthen post-contract monitoring and corrective measures. This will include increased audit activities, training suppliers of contracted labour on our standards and ways of working, and support tools for local management, including basic due diligence, non-compliance response options and an overview of potential risks. We expect these measures, including a pilot of 50 new audits per year, to be implemented within the next two years.

Introduction Strategic sustainability priorities Responding to a pandemic Responsible business practices Progress overview Data and assurance 27
  In March 2020, the executive leadership defined three priority focus areas to guide our response to the COVID-19 crisis
trade. The jobs created and economic activity sustained due to port activity have a positive impact throughout the surrounding communities.
Across the terminals, we applied procedures to mitigate the risk of contracting COVID-19. These included guidelines for the procedures that terminal and warehouse workers would have to adhere to before entering, while being in, and after leaving the workplace. This included training sessions and inspections of facilities to ensure safety for employees and other port and warehouse users. Furthermore, we outlined employee rights in case of quarantine or staying at home, and ensured visibility of these rights to all employees.
Serving our customers – and helping suppliers
In addition to protecting our people, Maersk’s top priority during the crisis was to ensure that the global logistics chains continue to work, so that businesses and people can trust supply chains to do their job – first and foremost that medical supplies reach hospitals and food reaches kitchen tables, but also to minimise harm to our economies and livelihoods.
Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, global supply chains have remained open: Our container ships continue to sail, our ports and warehouses continue to operate and trucks deliver goods
to distribution and fulfilment centres. To take one example, despite more than half the global economy being under lockdown, the world has avoided major disruption in global food markets.
There are many examples of how our employees found new solutions to challenging supply chain problems. Read one in the box below.

for decades, but there was arguably never more pressure to keep goods moving freely than in 2020. In extraordinary circumstances, our employees across the world have gone to extraordinary lengths to serve customers in new and creative ways, while taking extra care of each other and helping society to get through the crisis.
“Being onboard for more than ten months was quite an experience. I had my holiday on board, celebrated my birthday as well, and never knew the next time I would go ashore.
It was all about waiting and hoping for possibilities to off-board, coming to terms with cancelled flights and changing schedules. In the meantime, we found ways to keep a positive attitude and break the monotony of the sleep-eat-work cycle.
What kept me going was the encouragement and bond of the crew, family calls made possible by the improved internet connectivity, drawing portraits and constant prayers. All of this made the physically challenging and mentally draining life on board with an overdue contract a little lighter.”

Protecting our people
“How are you? Is everyone safe?” This greeting
became the standard opening comment in Maersk meetings in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic impacted where and how all our 80,000 employees in 130 countries worked and lived.
Alongside the threat to global health, the
risk of collapsing economies with extensive job loss and shortage of goods grew fast as the pandemic progressed. While economies and individual livelihoods were widely impacted, global trade lanes and supply chains remained in service. Because of flexible supply chains and digital connectivity, countries and businesses were able to maintain essential services and supplies, even as half the global population was in lockdown.
Heroes trapped at sea
At exactly 12:00 local time, on 1 May 2020, Maersk captains around the world tooted their horns in a celebration of the essential frontline workers who were keeping supply chains running – at sea, on the road, in ports, warehouses and factories across the world.
In Maersk, seafarers in particular were celebrated as “the unsung heroes of the COVID-19 pandemic”, as they continued to play an essential role in maintaining the flow of vital goods, such as food, fuels and medical supplies, that people everywhere need.
For many of our seafarers, the hero status was underlined by the fact that crews experienced prolonged stays on the same vessel, as crew changes were hindered by government restrictions.
Normally, a crew member stays on a vessel anywhere from two to six months. The Maritime Labour Convention states that crews can spend a maximum of 11 months on board. These norms were all broken in 2020.
Across the Maersk network, a total of 6,000 seafarers of 40 nationalities on 700 vessels work to ensure the flow of goods around the

world. When the build-up was at its highest, more than 2,500 colleagues had completed their contracts, but could not be relieved of their duties. Another, although much smaller, set of colleagues were hurt by the fact that they were unable to board vessels and fulfil their contracts.
To accelerate the process of bringing crew home, we gathered a cross-functional task force to create agreements with governments, airlines, airport operators, hotels and port authorities that would enable crews to obtain essential worker status to safely travel to and from major port hubs with major international airports, including on special Maersk charter flights. Moreover, an IT solution was put together to help track seafarer locations and maximise the number of people we could move, and procurement teams helped book over 100,000 hotel nights and 200,000 meals during the summer alone.
To overcome the multitude of bottlenecks we found on land, we created our own quarantine safe centres in strategic locations such as Manila and Mumbai where crew could be tested and certified as healthy to travel to join a vessel. We also created hubs for local quarantine in high-volume areas such as the Suez, Europe, Nigeria, Malaysia and Panama, which helped seafarers reach their destinations.
By the end of the year, we had succeeded in helping overdue crew members on or
off vessels.
Safe employment on land
More than 20,000 people work at the port terminals and inland facilities owned and operated by Maersk on six continents. Terminals play an important part in national and regional economies, first and foremost because they make sure goods flow to and from a country
or region. In some countries, a Maersk-owned terminal is the only gateway to international

large-scale distribution. Maersk began planning the logistics involved in this as early as the summer of 2020.
An important goal is to bring a vaccine to emerging and developing nations. To this end, COVAXX and Maersk established a global logistics partnership to distribute up to a billion doses of a COVAXX vaccine worldwide in 2021. As members of the World Economic Forum's Supply Chain & Transport Industry Action Group, we also endorsed a charter in support of globally inclusive, safe and sustainable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. The charter calls for engagement, asset, competency and expertise sharing, and support for UNICEF's distribution efforts.
Applying disaster response expertise
The Logistics Emergency Team, the disaster response partnership which Maersk has been an active member of since 2011, was activated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We received one request for deployment of a cold chain into South Sudan which will serve as storage for vaccines. We have placed three reefer containers with generator sets in a refugee centre, at a state hospital and the Ministry of Health, where they will serve as the backbone of a medical supply chain for ten million people. We are following this closely to assess whether it can be a scalable model for the global market at a later stage.
 Organising new exports to save products
On 24 March 2020, India came to a sudden standstill as Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a strict nation-wide lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. For Maersk and its customers, this meant a massive disruption of supply chains – trucks were abandoned by drivers rushing to get home, labourers stopped turning up at ports and yards, and customs house agents disappeared amid policy confusion.
Reliance Industries is the largest private company in India and a conglomerate spanning the energy, material, retail, entertainment and digital service sectors. Under the lockdown,
Reliance saw local demand for its important polymers business fall to zero. Polymers are manufactured with a continuous process that is difficult to stop and restart, so Reliance needed to keep its factories open.
With over 15,000 containers worth of polymers and no warehousing space, Reliance’s only option was to shift from local businesses to exports.
As road movement in India was halted in the early days of the lockdown, Maersk saw rail as
an obvious solution for Reliance. However, local rail suppliers were not prepared to handle the unprecedented jump in volume from one train
a week to 47 trains a week. Our team contacted eight different rail vendors and closed an agreement with them in 48 hours.
An even larger challenge was securing containers to move the polymers. The lockdown meant that import clearances were not taking place at a regular pace, and cargo inventory was building up in ports and yards. 15,000 40-foot containers were required for these exports – 10,000 of these were needed at Reliance’s Jamnagar, Gujarat plant alone.
To ensure an adequate number of containers, depots, terminals and carriers worked together to pool resources and flag any spare containers.

Safety
On Global Safety Day 2020, the crew on Svitzer Al Safliya discussed the risks, procedures and every day experiences of connecting and disconnecting towlines to and from vessels. The results were applied to improve best practices across the company.
Why is it important
Safety at work is a basic human right, and workplace conditions directly impact and influence workers as well as their families and communities.
Ambitions
We want to protect our people, the environment and our business, eliminate fatalities and severe injuries, enable Maersk to be a preferred employer and provide safe and resilient products and services to
our customers.
Targets
2020:
• Top 300 leaders have completed Leading Safety Differently workshops.
• Verification of effectiveness of critical controls.
• Continuous improvement in employee engagement, measured through
our Gallup survey.
Progress in 2020
A health, safety, security and environmental (HSSE) framework was developed throughout 2020 and launched early in 2021, aligning how safety processes and critical controls are implemented across all operations, including the allocation of core safety responsibilities and accountabilities of both employees and leaders of all levels across the business.
We have set targets and actively pursue progress within our focus areas.
Leadership
• The majority of the planned Leading Safety Differently workshops had to be cancelled due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. However, 80 of our targeted Top 300 leaders completed virtual sessions in 2020.
• We designed a new leadership programme which we expect to launch in 2021. This consists of a toolkit for leaders to direct, lead and manage safety with easily accessible and inspiring content that is real and relevant to their role and will help them integrate it into their daily business.
• Roll-out and implementation of the Safety Leadership Gemba Guidance which helps reconnect leadership to the reality of everyday work and to learn from the frontline, continued during 2020. Despite COVID-19 restrictions, more than 28,000 Gemba activities could take place across the company.
Fatalities in 2020
Keeping our people safe is a core value and an ethical responsibility for us as a company towards our employees, their families and communities.
2021:
Leading-indicator targets for building safety capacity are set for:
• Learning Team activity (to be completed within 40 days of every
High Potential Incident)
• Leadership Gembas (to be carried out according to plan) • Critical risk projects (on-time and on-scope delivery)
Building capacity
• The collaborative approach to critical risk project management, where different parts of our company work together to uncover risks, create controls and evaluate and validate those, was integrated into the business. Results include risks related to mooring, crane operations, access to cargo areas and more, as well as a new vessel inspection app.
• Adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a virtual delivery solution for learning teams, which was tested late in 2020 and is being rolled-out in early 2021.
Culture
• We see safety as a foundational contributor to employee engagement, and in line with our target the overall score in our engagement survey improved throughout 2020.
• The annual Global Safety Day had a somewhat smaller reach than in previous years due to COVID-19. Where possible, the day was celebrated under the theme ’Learning from each other’. This included more than 600 learning teams working on critical risks in their operations and on mental health and well-being, an area of great importance in 2020 due to the effects of COVID-19 on the well-being of our people. All learning collated from the frontline will inform the 2021 strategy and planning.
 Tragic fire leads to new stowage system
The official investigation of a fire on board the Maersk Honam in March of 2018, where five seafarers tragically lost their lives, was finalised in 2020 by the Transport Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB) in Singapore. They concluded
that the most likely source of the fire was a block of containers with declared dangerous cargo stowed inside a cargo hold in the forepart of the vessel. According to the report, the cause of the fire is not conclusive, but highly likely originated from the decomposition of dangerous cargo generating intense heat.
All cargo aboard Maersk Honam
was accepted and stowed onboard the vessel according to existing international guidelines and practices, which proved insufficient to prevent the loss of life and extensive damage caused by the fire. In response, we developed a risk-based stowage concept which divides each vessel into six different risk tolerance zones, and distributes the cargo in a way that ensures maximum fire resistance.
The system is now implemented on our entire fleet, both on the vessels we own and on those we charter. We are also working to enable a review and update
of the international regulations of this area, in order to optimally protect all crew, cargo, environment and vessels.
         A.P. Moller - Maersk’s (Maersk) safety strategy
is grounded in our Safety Differently philosophy, where the central premise is that safety is defined by having the capacity to manage risks under variable conditions. This must be enacted through leadership that engages with front-line employees and provides the support they need to make safe operations easier.
This philosophy is also evident in our safety targets, which do not highlight the absence of accidents, but rather the presence of leadership, that continuously engage with frontline employees to build capacity to eliminate as many as possible of the factors that contribute to the occurrence of accidents, and to manage the outcome of the accidents that still occur. We pursue the targets through activities in three tracks: engaging with workers, building capacity and promoting a learning culture. See 2020 progress on the next page.
Aligning standards everywhere
Up until 2020, Maersk’s safety organisation
was highly decentralised, which in some cases hindered the implementation of our safety strategy, and we have therefore reorganised our work to reinforce that Maersk has one, and only one, safety strategy, which is implemented and enforced equally across the company.
The new central Safety and Resilience team creates a strong pool of resources and tools including implementation support available at all levels across the company. In this way, we are able to match and mirror the integrated company that Maersk is becoming, and assure our customers that when they leave their
supply chain obligations in our hands, we have the capacity for safe operations in place. (Read more about sustainability in our end-to-end offerings on pp. 23-24).
Managing risks through learning teams
Over the past two years, we completed a number of projects, based on identification of the most critical risks related to fatal and severe injuries across our operational contexts. These include cargo fires, warehousing operations, dropped objects, mooring operations, man overboard and working at height.
The risks were identified and solutions developed using a core element in the Safety Differently toolbox, namely the learning teams approach, where front-line workers share their experiences with leadership teams, allowing
for a shared understanding of the risks and possible solutions, which can inform the allocation of resources and responsibility. In support of this approach, our port terminals organisation developed a leader-led programme, including an app that helps structure such learning conversations. By the end of 2020, there had been more than 36,000 recorded activities using the app since its launch in March 2020, and 4,831 times where unsafe work or working conditions were stopped before an incident occurred.
Safer mooring ropes through
crew engagement
One learning teams example is our work on mooring, which is one of the most dangerous operations on a vessel. When a mooring
rope breaks, it can move at over 800 km/ hour and snapback incidents can potentially cause severe injuries and fatalities. Through crew engagement, this risk was defined and a solution was developed. Now, Maersk has begun implementing a rope innovation called SnapBack Arrestor, where a broken mooring rope simply drops to the ground, instead of snapping back in unpredictable paths.
Mooring is an everyday event across the Maersk fleet and in the process mooring ropes breaking is bound to happen. The SBA ropes reduce the consequences significantly, and as such reflects the ‘Safety Differently’ approach as it builds capacity to safeguard people onboard as well as ashore. The phase-in of the new ropes across our fleet is set to be complete by 2025.
Sadly, a person lost his life working on one of our facilities. We realise that there is still much more for us to do, to learn and to improve in addressing our workplace risks.

Responsible ship recycling
 Over four years after we landed our first vessel at the ShreeRam yard (Plot 78), taking our declaration of wanting to change the ship recycling industry from words to action, the 10-km stretch of beach with recycling yards in Alang is a different world. We are proud of the progress made in Alang and are expanding our ambition to focus on creating opportunities for responsible ship recycling globally.
Documented improvements
In 2020 we conducted an impact study at yards engaged by A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk) in Alang to document the outcomes. Between 2017 and 2019, in line with the Responsible Ship Recycling Standard (RSRS), nine Maersk vessels were recycled at five different Alang yards under full-time supervision with stop-work authority and a verification regime through external audits. After 3,100 training sessions, 2,000 toolbox talks and 35 Lloyd's Register audits, not a single lost- time injury incident or fatality occurred. We have incentivised yards to invest in continual upgrades, which has also led to the construction of full impermeable floors in nine Maersk-approved yards and the purchase of 15 heavy-duty cranes in 11 yards that eliminate contact between vessel blocks the inter-tidal zone. There have been no major spills or incidents with hazardous materials on our projects at Maersk-engaged yards.
Appointment letters and payslips, minimum wages, overtime payments, annual health checks, a 24/7 ambulance dedicated to each yard and many more such facilities are now
standard practice, along with over 1200-men ILO-compliant worker dormitories built by Maersk-approved yards. For the wider Alang community and workforce, access to qualified healthcare and awareness training has led to improved health outcomes.
A progressive transformation is also seen at a broader Alang industry level – approximately 80 of the total of around 120 operational
yards voluntarily comply with the Hong Kong Convention, which is the only global convention on ship recycling.
Regulatory barriers to further progress
However, at yards in Alang as well as among responsible shipowners, the frustration and concern today are almost palpable. International waste legislation, the Basel Ban Amendment (BBA) on export of hazardous waste adopted
in 1995, entered into force on 5 Dec 2019, and may effectively hinder non-OECD countries such as India, from offering to recycle ships coming from OECD countries. This is particularly disappointing to the leading Alang yards,
who have invested significant resources
and engaged extensively with the European Commission over the past two years in order to comply with the EU Ship Recycling Regulation (EUSRR). These yards now comply with the EU regulation, except on a few solvable items related to waste management and access to hospitals with trauma facilities, and the yards were pending inclusion in the EU List, which lists global yards allowed to recycle vessels registered in EU countries.
We are proud of the progress made in Alang and are expanding our ambition to focus on creating opportunities for responsible ship recycling globally.
This situation is detrimental to the momentum achieved at Alang over the past five years, as well as to the shipowners. We do not agree with the claims made that the BBA now supersedes the EUSRR and the IMO Hong Kong Convention (once it enters into force). Both the EU and IMO regulations offer equal levels of protection
as the Basel Convention and general legal principles dictate the application of the specific legislation on ship recycling rather than the general provisions of waste handling.
Our position, based on thorough legislative analysis, is that there are legal options available to the EU and we are engaging with a multitude of stakeholders to find short- and long-term solutions to resolve this gridlock.
Changing our ambition
A further challenge is the fact that in the next few years, globally a big wave of post-panamax vessels, (whose category name is derived from the fact that they are too large to pass through the Panama Canal), will near their end of life. Very few yards included in the EU List are capable of handling post-panamax vessels, and even fewer wish to accept these, with repairs/ conversions either being their core business or offshore/military vessel recycling their priority due to higher margins. Thus, there is today
a lack of capacity for responsible recycling
of mainstream, commercial, post-panamax vessels, regardless of which flag they sail under and where the responsible recycling facilities are located.
With proven results from Alang that engagement on the ground leads to change, we are confident that opportunities to remedy this situation can emerge from India and other non-OECD countries. Thus, Maersk's ambition for our work with responsible ship recycling has changed from radically transforming the industry beginning in Alang to focusing on creating opportunities globally.
We are in active dialogue with a few global greenfield projects, for example one in the African continent, where we as interested end-users assist in researching, developing the business case and performing initial due diligence.

To create opportunities for responsible ship recycling globally for the benefit of workers and the environment, as well as responsible yards and shipowners.
Targets
2020:
• Continue to invest and work with selected yards in Alang
• Develop the wider Alang area
• Actively support and participate in the
development of the Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative
Progress in 2020
Three vessels were sent for RSRS-compliant recycling to the Alang yards in India and one for EUSRR- and RSRS-compliant recycling to an Aliaga yard in Turkey. Through a robust framework, we continually ensure RSRS compliance which goes far beyond the Hong Kong Convention at all Maersk- engaged yards globally.

industry, we can make a real impact by driving opportunities for responsible practice-driven, financially viable recycling.
  2021:
• Create opportunities for responsible ship recycling of post-panamax ships globally
• Work with industry stakeholders to support yards globally, including non-OECD countries, to achieve EUSRR-compliance and thereby increase actual capacity on the EU List
• Continue development of the wider Alang area
• Actively support and participate in the development
of the Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative
aimed at raising awareness on hygiene, substance abuse and sexually transmitted diseases covered 5,000 workers.
We remain steering group members of the Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative (SRTI), which we co-founded in 2018. The SRTI seeks to accelerate a voluntary, market-driven approach to responsible ship recycling practices, with today 11 shipowners disclosing. With a total of 26 signatories (shipowners and other stakeholders), it includes around 42% of the global container fleet by TEU capacity.

    Containers sending a message
While we recognise the need for our company to work harder to improve on our own targets on diversity and inclusion, we also believe that symbolic statements can help create global awareness of fundamental rights.
In that vein, we have branded two Maersk containers in rainbow colours. They made their debut in Mobile, USA and are now travelling the world with goods from our customers, and making appearances at select events for our company.
The containers have raised interest from
many of our customers who are also committed to driving inclusion in their organisations. In partnership with our customers, we will see these containers spread this important message. In 2020 both containers were deployed to deliver humanitarian relief to victims of Hurricane Laura in Louisiana, and later left Los Angeles to arrive in Shenzen in China, whereafter they connected to Europe.

Diversity and inclusion
2020 was a year of increased focus on inclusion and non-discrimination in much of the world, with movements such as Black Lives Matter originating in the US, as well of new bursts of attention to LGBTQ+ rights and continued focus on #metoo around the world.
Our global presence means that we are affected by events and movements regardless of where they take place, and they impact us to take specific actions and provide input to
A.P. Moller - Maersk’s (Maersk) continued, global conversation on diversity and inclusion.
Diversity and inclusion are part of our value system, and our support for social justice
and anti-discrimination is also expected by our employees. In the North American part
of our company, we took time to reflect on what discrimination means and how this impacts our teams. Conversation with our leaders began with virtual sessions focused
on race discrimination, providing them with
a framework to support discussions within their teams. We also ramped up our focus on allyship, where you work for change even if you are not personally affected by what you are aiming to change. This topic is not new to Maersk but we find that its importance to the diversity agenda is growing.
Openness relies on psychological safety
We have clear policies in place stating that we do not accept discrimination, and we have a whistleblower system with a range of options for our employees to communicate grievances. It can be daunting raising grievances on such sensitive issues and we want to do more to encourage our employees to speak up and report any concerns of harassment and or discrimination at Maersk.
We are doing this through increasing awareness and capability in building psychologically safe teams and cultures. We build this into our leadership programmes and provide separate virtual learning sessions available to all employees.
In 2021 we will be conducting our first global Inclusion survey that aims to increase our understanding on issues such as discrimination, harassment, diversity and inclusion. The
results from the survey will be used to focus our priorities going forward. We have taken
the decision to set up an ombuds office to specifically hear out grievances that employees do not feel comfortable reporting to human resources departments, line managers or posting to the whistleblower system.
Unconscious bias work continues
Our initiatives on diversity and inclusion support our drive towards targets on gender and nationality representation in management. Our key approach is employee engagement and capability building, and over the past three years, we have worked on creating awareness of unconscious bias and related effects, establishing inclusion networks covering our global organisation.
As is the case for race, gender, beliefs, disabilities and more, it is a basic human right not to be discriminated against due to one's sexual orientation. In support of human rights, we have participated in Pride activities since 2018.
2020 saw our planned Pride celebrations move to a virtual platform and we used this opportunity to reflect on the history and evolution of Pride, among other things through a series of global webinars to understand its journey and essence: the ability to freely and safely express oneself. This also allowed us
to address the racial conversations that were dominating societies around the world and the importance of talking about racism as well as where we stand as a company.
Why is it important
It is a basic obligation and a core element of our values not to discriminate against our employees. Discrimination bars people from living up to their full potential, creates inequality and less stable and prosperous societies. We also want to leverage
Ambitions
We aspire to create an inclusive culture where
all employees can have a sense of belonging and contribute to their fullest. In doing this, we will be in a prime position to attract people from the widest talent pool, specifically increasing the gender and nationality diversity at our senior levels.
Targets
Our target is to have three women on the Board of Directors, if the Board consists of less than twelve members, and four women, if the Board consists of twelve or more members.
Progress in 2020
The target for representation of women on the
A.P. Moller - Maersk Board of Directors was met in 202010. However, we are still not satisfied with the progress we have made towards our nominal targets on gender and national representation in senior management. We are implementing new controls and processes to drive improvements, and during 2021, we will set and share updated targets for the period from 2021 - 2025.
Our progress on women in management is adversely impacted by the fact that the share of women working in logistics and technology – which are areas in which we recruit many candidates –

is very low. In January 2020, we joined an initiative hosted by the Danish Shipping Association focused on attracting more women to shipping and logistics, and we have established a women’s network in our global technology function.
As part of our global maternity policy, we have a target of reaching a 90% retention rate for women returning to work after maternity leave. In 2020, this was the case for 74% of the target group. Maersk's gender diversity and inclusion policy provides details of our actions to increase gender diversity. It is available on Maersk's website11.

Moller - Maersk A/S has a number of subsidiary companies that fall under the Danish legislative requirements on gender reporting, and which have all set targets for the underrepresented gender on the respective Boards of Directors. Of the companies, a portion have already obtained target representation on the Board, while the remaining continue to strive for their targets. See the management reports of the respective companies.

   Working with unions during COVID-19
During 2020, we engaged with trade unions at global and local levels to discuss the needs of our employees both at sea and on land
and to make a joint effort in protecting their health.
Our leadership had discussions with the International Transport workers Federation's leadership to align our approach on COVID-19
and explore options for collaboration. This resulted in sharing of information and knowledge about our solutions to make the necessary crew changes
and get seafarers home,
just as we coordinated our discussions with the ILO which led to a resolution in December 2020, recognising seafarers as essential workers.
Locally, we have worked with trade unions on:
• Health & safety measures for employees, including mutual agreements on workplace instructions, cleaning and sanitation, and protective clothing.
• Business continuity, including different ways of servicing vessels, shift- changes in terminals and on tugs.
• Supply chain continuity, where the broader supply chain community including truckers, rail staff, warehousing workers and cargo owners, established agreements and conditions for collaboration.

Why is it important
The way we treat our employees is fundamental to the way we want to do business, and our employees are essential to the success of
A.P. Moller - Maersk's (Maersk).
Ambitions
All our employees will be treated fairly in a safe and healthy working environment, and we are committed to creating a working environment where each employee feels valued and can prosper.
Targets
2020
• Ensure compliance with our Commit Rule on Global Employee Relations, which is based on internationally recognised labour standards.
• In 2020, improve employee relations maturity level in the business by increasing management capabilities and mitigating risks of working with third-party labour in our supply chain.
Progress in 2020
Our work on employee relations rests on the
core belief that employees are essential to the development and success of our business. We act in accordance with international frameworks and conventions from the UN, OECD and ILO, as well as in compliance with local legislation where we operate. Our leadership have access to support for their negotiations with employee representatives, where they discuss the local collective bargaining agreement.
A focus area in 2020 was third-party labour which is a risk area and important for us as we expand our logistics business. Read more on pp. 23-24.
COVID-19 prevented the roll-out of the Employee Relations face-to-face training programme. Instead, we began the development of a virtual training programme that will be launched in 2021.
The COVID-19 pandemic did not lead to any Maersk employees losing their job. However, we
let go of 2,700 employees in 2020 as part of the strategic integration of our business and brands. When the organisation changes, we have pre- established information and consultation processes with participation from both management and employees, and we work to ensure that all standards for employee relations are upheld.
This begins with ensuring respect for internationally recognised human rights and labour standards in all our workplaces.
2021:
• Ensure compliance with our Commit Rule on Global Employee Relations, which is based on internationally recognised labour standards.
• Conduct our bi-annual labour rights assessment • Help to make employee engagement and
workforce management integral to the
development of end-to-end logistics
• Ensure that new ways of working (e.g. flexible
working hours, digitisation/automation) are introduced responsibly and involving relevant stakeholders
The work to align our business to future demands and opportunities will continue, and we are taking action to enter into these processes as prepared as possible.
One example is that we introduced a new way to engage management teams in our terminal business in working pro-actively with employee relations. We mapped the potential risks and level of maturity in managing employee relations in
all terminals, with indicators such as the level
of stability of political, social and environmental issues in the community and the frequency of communication between management and employee representatives. The goal is to build maturity in these relationships including a vision and strategy for each terminal on employee relations.
In 2020, the whistleblower hotline was used 143 times to report on issues related to potential violations of HR-related laws, rules or company values. 17 of these cases were substantiated, 11 of which were related to the Commit Rule on Global Employee Relations. Appropriate action was taken according to company policies. 45 cases are still under investigation.
Why is it important
Through our operations and purchasing decisions we have an impact on social, environmental and economic conditions in our industry and global supply chains. Monitoring and addressing
Ambitions
Manage the risk of supplier non-compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct to support our commercial ambitions of end-to-end sustainable product offerings.
Targets
2020
• Ensure that all purchasing activities are aligned with RP requirements. Successfully close improvement plans.
• Review responsible procurement programme to align with evolving risk picture from expansion of activities on land.
• Participate in collaborative efforts on trucking.
Progress in 2020
The A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk) Supplier Code of Conduct (Code) sets out minimum requirements
on responsible business practices for our direct suppliers and select sub-suppliers, to operate in accordance with responsible business principles and in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In our own supply chain, we work through our Responsible Procurement Programme. Increasingly, this also serves a commercial purpose, as our global integrator strategy leads to purchasing logistics on behalf of customers outside our own supply chain. On activities related to this aspect, please see p. 23.
In our Responsible Procurement Programme,
we have assessed compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct with approximately 3,500 suppliers in high-risk categories, by conducting due diligence activities such as audits, self- assessments and documentation reviews. This is out of a total supplier population of about 59,000. We use a risk-based approach working with suppliers in 15 high-risk categories12. Suppliers are asked to address any gaps in the implementation of requirements through a time-bound improvement plan in consultation with Maersk. Periodic reviews and follow-up audits are conducted.
sustainability risks in our supply chain strengthens, our stakeholders’ trust in our brand and increases our preparedness for rising regulatory attention on due diligence in supply chains.
2021:
• Ensure all purchasing activities are aligned with Responsible Procurement requirements
• Expand scope of Responsible Procurement in line with ambitions to strengthen sustainability in end-to-end offerings
• Operationalise post-sourcing audits for trucking, warehousing and third-party labour providers
• Prepare for legislation on supply chain due diligence
Our audit and assessment activities in 2020
are shown in the side bar. The number of audits decreased due to the impact of COVID-19, and physical audits were replaced by virtual solutions. Equally, the number of self-assessments decreased, as we took in fewer new suppliers in high-risk categories, and timelines for improvement plans had to be extended. We did not terminate any relationships as a result of non-compliance.
To raise internal awareness of our standards in procurement, we created a short e-learning programme on responsible procurement in 2020, which is now part of the annual compliance training for all employees.
One of our most important high-risk categories is shipyards. In 2020, we co-led the work of a UN Global Compact Action Platform to develop a guidance for shipyards, which will serve as an implementation tool for the Sustainable Ocean Principles released in 2019. It will establish common industry standards for social and environmental performance, and is expected to be published in 2021.
      12 Our 15 high-risk categories are: Trucking and Intermodal, warehousing services, facility management, outsourced labour, terminals, shipbuilding yards and drydocks, security offshore, promotional items, customs agents, security onshore, construction, chemicals and paints, equipment, maintenance and repair, container manufacturers and manning (seafarers).

Air emissions
Why is it important
Air emissions from ocean-going shipping have negative effects on human health and the natural environment, as they cause diseases and premature death.
Ambitions
To continue to be an industry leader working towards reducing air emissions from international shipping, particularly in regard to SOx and NOx emissions, which are important in port areas and when sailing close to shore.
Targets
• Fully comply with regulatory demands to reduce air emissions impacts and continue investing in maintaining and implementing solutions that will enable this.
Progress in 2020
Across A.P. Moller - Maersk's (Maersk) activities,
we strive to minimise the known negative impacts related to our operations. This is also true for air emissions which include SOx, NOx and particulate matters. All of these are potentially harmful to human health and we work to fully comply with regulatory demands to limit air emissions and strive to minimise the impacts.
On 1 January, one of the largest changes in the maritime industry in decades came into effect with the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 0.5% global cap on the content of sulphur in fuels. One of the enforcement mechanisms for this legislation is a ban on carrying non-compliant fuels on vessels, except for vessels where scrubbers are installed to clean exhaust gasses. Mainly due to the IMO 2020 sulphur cap, which Maersk complies with through the use of low sulphur fuels as well as scrubbers on a share of our vessels, SOx emissions have dropped significantly from approx. 569,000 tonnes in 2019 to approx. 102,000 tonnes in 2020.
Thorough preparations in the years leading up to this date ensured a successful switch from heavy fuel oil to low sulphur fuels across our fleet of both owned and chartered vessels. In 2020, we saw only four cases of non-compliance with international sulphur regulations caused by contamination in the supply chain of oil or by human error. As a remedial action, we have begun testing sulphur content of the fuel prior to bunkering.
Ocean health
Why is it important
The global oceans redistribute CO2 and heat, supply people and communities with food, water, renewable energy, and build livelihoods through tourism, trade and transport. The health of
Ambitions
We see ourselves as citizens of the oceans and we are committed to doing no harm while at the same time actively participating in restoring ocean health and resilience and protecting animal habitats.
Targets
• Zero non-contained oil spills above 10 m3.
• Fully comply with rules and regulations to minimise negative impact on ocean health, including waste
management and ballast water systems
Progress in 2020
Our first obligation as citizens of the oceans is to comply with rules and regulations that safeguard ocean health. For A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk), this includes managing fuels or chemical substances to avoid spills into water, managing waste to keep it out of the oceans and living up to the regulation on ballast water. We have policies and procedures to manage and mitigate all these risks.
In 2020, there were two non-contained spills. One spill to land in our terminal business in
The Netherlands (19 m3) and one spill to water relating to Maersk Supply Service and resulting from a mud spill (20.3 m3).
Dumping waste at sea contributes to the ailing health of oceans and the biodiversity crisis. Maersk has a zero-dumping policy, obligating all vessels to store waste and discard it when in a port with adequate facilities. We are challenged by a lack of capacity in qualified waste reception facilities at ports internationally. We have mapped and vetted facilities to enable our vessels to plan around the gaps, but our operations would be more efficient with proper facilities available.
Also affecting the health of oceans and biodiversity is how vessels handle ballast water. This is often added in one marine environment to keep the vessel stable and safe, and later discharged in another environment due to changes in cargo. This may result in invasive species disturbing local ecosystems. The Ballast Water Management Convention (BWMC) obligates shipowner to have ballast water systems installed on all vessels by 2024. We are progressing in accordance with our plan to
   Reducing
the impact of SOx
Research has shown
that the annual, ship-related global health impacts from using fuel with 3.5% sulphur instead of 0.5% fuel are
137,000
premature deaths
7 million
childhood asthma cases13
This is the driver behind the IMO's legislation on SOx, which from 2020 requires the entire global fleet to sail on fuels with
0.5%
sulphur content
The compliance measures approved by the IMO are
Carrying and using only low- sulphur fuels on vessels
Installing scrubbers to clean vessels' exhaust
Enforcement of the legislation is critical. On just one voyage from Asia to Europe a large container vessel could save up to
USD 750,000
by using non- compliant fuel.
  Expanding our support for The Ocean Cleanup
Since 2018, Maersk has
been proud to partner with The Ocean Cleanup, providing offshore support for their plastic waste cleanup system in the Pacific Ocean. A new, three-year partnership agreement was established during 2020. It expands the collaboration to include both maritime and end-to-end logistics services, in line with the anticipated scale-up of The Ocean Cleanup's ocean activities as well as the expansion to include systems deployed in large rivers.
Maersk's assistance will range from shipping, customs clearance and warehouse and storage management.
On the offshore side,
in addition to deployment services, Maersk will contribute to developing a more sustainable maritime approach with alternative fuels and new fleet design. Maersk’s support is provided as full or partial donations, or on favourable terms.
The Ocean Cleanup’s
goal is to reach a 90% reduction of floating ocean plastic by 2050. This is an important issue to many of our seafarers as well as to colleagues on land, and in 2020 we ran a campaign encouraging employees and teams to become Ocean Ambassadors, take local initiatives and share their efforts to clean up beaches and their environment. Despite COVID-19 restrictions, we saw around 80 team contributions from around the world.
We support regulation such as the cap on sulphur content in fuel oil, which will significantly reduce these effects and create a level playing field for socially and environmentally responsible practices in the industry.
• Actively engage at international and regional levels to secure a level playing field and high levels of enforcement of regulation across the industry.
The main concern in the years leading up to the cap taking effect was uneven enforcement, as it was estimated that a large container vessel could save around USD 750,000 sailing from a port in Asia to
a port in Europe when using non-compliant 3.5% marine fuel instead of compliant 0.5% fuel.
While the level of control is not always as stringent as we would have hoped for, we have received no indication that compliance is lacking. Looking at which oil types are sold on the global market is a useful proxy for evaluating compliance, and it appears that the low-sulphur fuel uptake is at the expected level. However, it should also be noted that due to COVID-19, port state controls have been made more difficult. We therefore hope that enforcement campaigns can resume in 2021.
The use of scrubbers to clean the vessels' exhaust of SOx remains a discussion point and
no independent global survey of the effects of scrubbers has yet been produced to support global legislation. Still, more national and regional legislation is being implemented, for example in the EU, some US states and Australia, requiring vessels to shut off the scrubber system when entering near-coastal waters and switch to low-sulphur oil. As a result, more ports are expected to declare a ban of open-loop scrubbers.
Maersk has installed open-loop scrubbers on a share of our vessels as a commercial risk management measure.
the ocean is rapidly deteriorating due to increasing temperatures, acidification, depletion of natural resources and pollution from land and sea, including large quantities of plastic waste.
• Continue collaboration with The Ocean Cleanup. • Support ocean science research through data
collection and partnerships.
comply with this demand. We saw no non- compliances with existing regulation. All marine life from plankton to whales reacts to noise, and for this reason the increase in underwater noise from human activity is of growing concern. One example of this is how ship noise impacts and confuses the communication of an endangered species of orca whales. A positive bi-product of some of our energy efficiency retrofits of vessels is that the level of ship noise is lowered. We sail at slower speeds in areas where these whales have been identified.
Collaborating for ocean health
Weather and sea state observations from vessels at sea provide data on meteorological conditions for weather forecasts, help climate scientists understand climate change, and help to protect life and property on vessels by allowing better forecasting of storms and other extreme ocean- related events. In 2020, we agreed to commit our fleet of 300 owned vessels to be part of the global Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) scheme, run by the World Meteorological Organization and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO. By mid-year 2021, we will have finalised installation of fully automated weather stations on 50 vessels.
We have also contributed to the UN Global Compact's guidance for the shipping industry to support implementation of the Sustainable Ocean Principles, which we participated in establishing
in 2019.

Anti-corruption and Responsible tax
Introduction Strategic sustainability priorities Responding to a pandemic
Responsible business practices Progress overview Data and assurance 41
Anti-corruption
Why is it important
Corruption undermines social and economic development. It destabilises the business environment and adds to the cost of participating
in global trade. It affects external confidence as well as company morale. Non-compliance with legislation
Ambitions
We aim to eliminate corruption in the industries where we are active through both multistakeholder collaboration and actions in our own operations.
Targets
Comply with legislation on anti-corruption practices, which ultimately translates to zero bribery and elimination of facilitation payments.
Progress in 2020
The risk of corruption in our ocean business relates primarily to interactions with authorities in ports and at border controls, and mostly as facilitation payments. In our terminals, the risk is greatest when negotiating government agreements on concessions. Risks on land and in our supply chain are predominantly managed through our Responsible Procurement programme.
We work to combat bribery, fraud, kickbacks and preferential treatment by performing due diligence of agents, joint venture partners, key suppliers, and M&A targets prior to signing a contract or entering
a new market. Expectations to employees are outlined in the A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk) Code of Conduct and the Maersk Anti-Corruption policies and guidelines. We enforce rules on travel, meals, lodging, gifts, amenities and entertainment, and employees complete annual training on compliance. Our current compliance programme is based on guidelines for complying with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
We work on projects focused on risk-based mitigation measures, e.g. in-person training, transaction testing, spot checks and appointment of business compliance ambassadors, strengthening our internal compliance controls framework as well as rolling out a conflict-of-interest policy. Executive commitment through words and actions has helped set the tone for the rest of the company.
One top priority in 2020 was finalising the implementation of the Maersk third-party management process, which in this structured form is a new
Responsible tax
Why is it important
Well-functioning tax systems locally and internationally help finance education, infrastructure and other public services that support sustainable development, local societies, business and trade.
Ambitions
Be a compliant and accountable taxpayer with responsible and transparent tax practices.
Targets
• Ensure full compliance with tax regulations in all countries where we operate.
• Continue to engage in dialogue with stakeholders on tax matters.
Progress in 2020
A.P. Moller - Maersk's (Maersk) total tax charge in 2020 was 407 million USD, compared to 458 million in 2019. See the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Annual Report 2020 for more details.
We continue our dialogue with stakeholders including the B Team, learning and sharing best practices with other companies who have also endorsed the B Team's Tax Principles.
We are in the process of updating the Maersk Tax Principles, providing more relevant information to our stakeholders and explaining the different tax rules, under which Maersk operates. In particular, how our shipping activities are taxed under the tonnage tax regime. This is a methodology using vessel tonnage to determine the taxable income on which corporate tax is paid. As a result, liner entities are not taxed on actual commercial profit or loss. As our business grows on land, more of our income will be taxed according to regular corporate tax rules and based on actual profit.
As part of our updated Maersk Tax Principles we will be disclosing tax payments, in accordance with the OECD Country by Country Reporting (CBCR) principles, for the largest taxpaying countries per region. We have
   When third parties act on our behalf
Working through third parties is a known corruption risk
to our business. To improve risk mitigation, we have invested in a third-party management system, and
in 2020 we developed and initiated the roll-out of a structured risk-based third- party management process across Maersk.
In the first year of operations,
1200
leaders and employees have been trained
250
third parties have been or are being processed
5
third-party engagements were avoided or stopped on ethical grounds
Through this process, we select the third parties best suited for our business
based on their competence, integrity, and other relevant capabilities. We also have a process for comprehensive due diligence on acquisition targets, joint venture partners and shareholders through which we reviewed 60 potential partners in 2020, as well as created a process for timely and orderly integration of the acquired entity
into existing compliance programme structures.
  on bribery and corruption may lead to legal and reputational risks, extra costs, inefficiencies in our business, fines, imprisonment and ultimately debarment from markets.
We recognise the need for companies to support the local economies in which they do business.
      addition to our controls. Read more about this in the side bar.
In 2020, we registered five minor incidents of facilitation payments on own vessels, and reduced payments on chartered vessels by a further 39% compared to 2019.
We are investigating how we will address facilitation payments in ports and in the inland logistics and are among other things conducting a pilot study in Southeast Asia to map and understand where the money originates and how it travels through systems and processes. We will be scaling up this project to develop a global
approach to this issue, just as we will continue to collaborate with the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network on this and other projects.
Of the channels used for reporting, the whistleblower hotline was used in twelve instances to report on public sector corruption cases. So far, none of the cases have substantiated while three cases are still under investigation.
In December 2020, the Brazilian authorities filed a civil lawsuit against A.P. Moller - Maersk A/S and other Maersk group entities related to allegations that a third-party broker made improper payments in connection with certain tanker charter party agreements entered into with Petrobras between 2008 and 2010. We remain committed to cooperating with the authorities, but cannot publicly comment on ongoing litigation.
• Implement the B-Team Responsible Tax Principles with reporting for 2020.
chosen this disclosure approach to achieve the right balance between our support for additional transparency on corporate tax and ensuring the relevance of the disclosed information.
Our updated Maersk Tax Principles and CBCR tax payments will be available on the Maersk.com website in Q2 2021, when the 2020 CBCR tax numbers are available.
The EU list of noncooperative tax authorities for 2020 comprises twelve countries, of which Maersk has activities in four: Due to a prior year adjustment, in Panama we paid USD 781,000 in taxes on a profit of USD 460,000, in the US Virgin Islands we paid USD 743,000 in taxes on a profit of USD 1,531,000 and in Barbados we paid USD 15,000 in taxes on a profit of USD 477,000. We have very minor profits (less than USD 1,000) and tax payments in Trinidad and Tobago.
In December 2020, as per the deadline for 2019 CBCR tax numbers, we disclosed full country by country reporting to the Danish tax authorities in accordance with our legal obligations.

Social performance
Our employees
FTE data is taken from the audited 2020 Annual Report of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S where more information can be found.
Continued focus on our targets has helped us make a slight improvement in our leadership numbers for women and target nationalities.
Further comments on our performance on diversity and inclusion, along with our targets and performance on representation of women on the Board of Directors and representation of women and persons from countries that are not in the OECD high-income countries list, can be found on page 34-35.
One fatal accident relates to a subcontractor in the Apapa terminal in Nigeria (see more on p. 31). LTIf is calculated as number of injuries relative to exposure hours. It has increased due to improved recording of injuries sustained by contractors in our inland logistics business area, while the exposure hours for contractors were not available.
Environmental performance
Energy consumption
Decrease is due to improved efficiency and strategic focus on decarbonisation. Because of COVID-19, fewer vessels were in operation with less cargo in Q2 and Q3 2020.
Small increase in gas fuel consumption is mainly due to improved reporting in terminals.
Decrease is due to among others a change to reporting based on actual invoices rather than office standards. This is partly offset by an increase in air charter.
Increase in consumption of biofuels for the Maersk ECO Delivery shipping service and for use in terminals.
Consumption of renewable energy is reported separately for the first time in 2020. This is made possible due to improved reporting in terminals.
Increase is mainly due to improved reporting based on actual invoices rather than office standards, offset by reductions due to reduced vessel calls and working from home.
Decrease in total energy consumption is due to the decrease in fuel oil consumption.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
96% of our scope 1 emissions come from the operations of our fleet. Decrease is due to improved efficiency and our strategic focus on decarbonisation.
Increase in indirect GHG emissions is due to increase in electricity consumption.
Indirect GHG emissions are reported using the market-based method, in accordance with the GHG Protocol for the first time in 2020.
Value chain GHG emissions are reported in accordance with the GHG Protocol for the first time in 2020. See p. 22 for more information.
Improvement in operational energy efficiency has been achieved through both technical and operational improvement initiatives
Other air emissions
SOx is produced from the combustion of heavy fuel oil. Decrease in SOx emissions is due to the shift to low sulphur fuel and the use of scrubbers with regards to IMO2020, as well as a decrease in fuel oil consumption.
NOx is produced from the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen gases in the air during combustion of fuels. Decrease in NOx emissions is due to the decrease in fuel oil consumption.
Other resource consumption
Decrease is mainly due to an adjustment in vessel waste reporting and ongoing projects for reducing hazardous waste.
Increase is due to improved reporting and change to reporting based on actual invoices rather than office standards, offset by reductions due to working from home. Spills (hydrocarbon)
Two uncontained spills above the threshold of >10 m3. One spill to land in the Maasvlakte 2 Terminal (19 m3), and another spill to water in MSS resulting from mud spill (20 m3) Economic performance

Sustainability accounting principles
We report on relative CO2 emissions reduction using EEOI (Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator) methodology. EEOI is defined by IMO in MEPC.1/ Circ.684 and is calculated as gCO2/(Ton cargo x Nm).
In practice we calculate EEOI on voyage level and aggregate it in the following way:
(gCO2 voy1+gCO2 voy2+gCO2 voy3)
((Ton cargo x Nm)voy 1+ (Ton cargo x Nm)voy 2+ (Ton cargo x Nm)voy 3)
The data sources are:
1. g CO2 – Based on fuel consumption, from
departure voyage 1, to departure voyage 2, multiplied with relevant CO2 factor (3.114 for HFO, 3.206 for MDO).
2. Ton cargo – Calculated via draft and displacement tables, subtracting vessel weight and ballast water and fuel stock.
3. Nm – GPS distance from departure voyage 1, to departure voyage 2.
In 2020, the baseline for EEOI has been recalculated to include missing data points for historical performance.
From 2020, scope 2 emissions are reported in two ways: location-based and market-based. For the latter, market-based factors are used for EU countries and the U.S. while IEA factors are used for other countries.
From 2020, scope 3 emissions are reported in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Of the 15 scope 3 categories in the Protocol only nine categories are deemed relevant for our business activities. The excluded categories, Cat. 8 upstream leased assets, Cat. 9 downstream transportation and distribution, Cat. 10 processing of sold products, Cat. 13 downstream leased assets, Cat. 14 franchises and Cat 15 investment, were determined not to have significant relevance
to Maersk’s business model. From a reporting perspective we have furthermore decided to apply a materiality threshold of 1% of the total scope 3 emissions which excludes the following categories from reporting: Cat 5. waste generated in operations, Cat. 6 business travel, Cat. 7 employee commuting, and Cat. 12 end of life treatment of sold products.
Scope 3 reporting thus comprises five remaining categories: Cat. 1 - purchased goods and services, which is reported based on procurement data
and includes OPEX goods. Cat. 2 - capital goods, which is reported based on procurement data
and includes our capital investments such as e.g. retrofit of vessels and dry docking. We include the full scope 3 impact the first year of a CAPEX investment. Category 3 - fuel and energy related activities, which is reported based on actual fuel procured and consumed. Category 4 - upstream transportation and distribution, which is reported based on procurement data multiplied by relevant emission factor per transportation category (air/
sea/truck/ rail). This means that e.g. trucking only includes carrier haulage. Category 11 - use of
sold products, which is reported based on sale of used containers and vessel recycling. The method includes splitting the product into waste categories and waste treatment type based on category
and region.
When preparing our scope 3 emissions in the
material categories listed above, we have provided procurement and accounting data to an external service provider, which has then applied our data in their model for calculating related carbon emissions. The scope 3 emissions data returned to us by the external service provider have then been entered into our reporting. The scope 3 emissions stated have not been subject to review by our assurance provider PwC.
For categories 1 and 2 data for Maersk Supply Service is not included due to data compatibility. Category 4 excludes when customers arrange their own transport as no data in this case is available for Maersk to reasonably accurately calculate scope 3 impact.
Definitions:
• Number of employees is the average number of full-time equivalents (FTEs). FTEs are calculated based on the total number of compensable hours (days) in a work year compared to the number of hours (days) in a ‘norm’ work year. Excluded are employees on unpaid leave, contractors and temporary staff.
• Headcounts are defined as regular employees not on leave, on paid leave and on unpaid leave. Excluded are contractors and temporary staff.
• Women in leadership is the percentage of women in level 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, corresponding to Senior Managers, Leaders, Senior Leaders, and Executives, compared to total headcount of the same levels.
• Gender – female over total is the percentage of women employed based on headcount.
• Target nationalities in leadership is the percentage of leaders with non-high-income OECD nationalities in level 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, corresponding to Senior Managers, Leaders, Senior Leaders, and Executives, compared to total headcount of the same levels.
• Fatalities is the headcount number of accidents leading to the death of the employee.
• LTIf (Lost-Time Injury frequency) measures the number of lost-time injuries per million exposure hours. Lost-time injuries (LTI) is the sum of fatalities, permanent total disability (PTD), permanent partial disability (PDD) and lost work day case (LWC). A Lost Workday Case (LWC) is any work-related injury, other than
a fatal injury, which results in a person being unfit for work on any day or shift after the day of occurrence of the occupational injury. Permanent Partial Disability (PDD) is any work
injury which results in the complete loss, or permanent loss of use, of any member or part of the body, or any impairment of functions of parts of the body, regardless of any pre-existing disability of the injured member or impaired body function. Permanent Total Disability
(PTD) is any work injury which incapacitates
an employee permanently and results in termination of employment on medical grounds. Excluded from LTIs are suicide or attempted suicide, criminal or terrorist activity, and incidents which occur off the ship but where the consequences appear onboard at some later time.
• Energy consumption encompasses fuel oil, gas fuels, other fuels (diesel, gasoline, kerosene, and heating oil), and biofuel as well as the consumption of electricity / district heating and renewable energy.
• Renewable technologies, from which energy is derived to use for electricity or heating, include solar panels, wind turbines, biomass and batteries.
• Direct GHG (scope 1) is the sum of all six Kyoto gasses converted to CO2 equivalents. Kyoto gasses comprise: CO2, CH4, and N2O, which
are calculated based on fuel consumption/ combustion, and HFC, SF6, NF3 and HCFC, which are based on direct consumption.
• Indirect GHG (scope 2) is the CO2 equivalents’ converted sum of CO2, CH4 and N2O, calculated on consumed electricity and district heating bought from a third party. Scope 2 emissions are reported using location-based emission factors, and using market-based factors (see 'Emissions conversions and calculations').
• Value chain GHG (scope 3) is calculated on procurement and accounting data and covers all six main greenhouse gases.
• Other air emissions include SOx and NOx, which both are calculated based on fuels consumed multiplied by generally accepted conversion factors for the respective fuels. In case of scrubber use, SOx emissions are reported based on Clean Cargo guidelines, where SOx output is assumed to be maximum for the operating area in which the vessel spends 80% of time.
• Amount of waste is the sum of all waste types generated.
• Amount of water is the sum of all water consumed, excluding ballast water and water for re-injection.
• Uncontained spills over 10 m3 are defined as any type of spills of hydrocarbon liquids greater than ten m3, resulting from any unintended, irreversible release associated with current operations.
• To secure completeness, office standards have been developed based on 2020 data, which can be used for offices with no production or warehousing, etc. These standards are only to be used if other more accurate information is not available.
Reporting framework
A.P. Moller - Maersk does not apply a specific overall reporting framework but uses the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines as guidance to determine report content and quality in terms of materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, completeness, balance, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity and reliability.
Reporting period
Our reporting covers the period from 1 January to 31 December 2020.
Controls
While data regarding number of employees, women in leadership, gender and target nationalities are generated from our HR systems, data regarding accidents, fatalities, exposure hours, energy consumption, waste, water and spills are reported through our consolidated reporting tool based on submitted data from all reporting entities within A.P. Moller - Maersk. This tool is validated via internal audit, with manuals and online training in place. A set of generally accepted accounting principles for sustainability has been established, which defines the reporting rules, processes and responsibilities. A controlling guideline has been distributed to help secure the businesses' own assurance of submitted data, before sign-off by the respective CEOs and CFOs. Furthermore, all businesses are obliged to provide explanation sheets on significant data developments. The data reported under financial scope is included in the framework used to assure risks and controls for financial reporting (Danish Statements Act §107b, section 1, no 6).
Scope
Operational scope is applied for safety and
spills data when A.P. Moller - Maersk or one of
its subsidiaries has the governing authority and responsibility for health, safety and environmental management of the people, processes and
facility – either directly or indirectly via third-party contractual arrangements. This approach excludes data from assets that are partly owned by
A.P. Moller - Maersk but operated by another company. Mobile assets are included when operated by A.P. Moller - Maersk. For vessels, the International Safety Management Code Document of Compliance must be held by A.P. Moller - Maersk to include the data.
Financial scope is applied for all other sustainability data, and is defined as follows: • Owned assets and leased in assets that
A.P. Moller - Maersk uses: A.P. Moller - Maersk is liable for consumption, emissions and other environmental elements
• Owned assets that are leased out:
A.P. Moller - Maersk is not liable for consumption, emissions and other environmental elements – the lessee is.
Technical management of an asset on behalf of third parties does not change the responsibility. Thus, consumption and emissions still belong to the asset owner/lessee who uses the asset.
With regard to greenhouse gases, the reporting must be in accordance with the GHG Protocol: direct emissions from own assets (Scope 1), indirect emissions from purchased electricity and district heating (Scope 2), and value chain emissions across material categories (Scope 3).
Diversity and inclusion data includes all brands, global service centres, corporate functions, and Boards. Joint ventures are out of scope. Gender and nationality data, which includes women
in leadership, gender – female/total, target nationalities in leadership, target nationalities/ total, is reported by headcount and extracted from SAP HR along with manual inputs of data not recorded in SAP HR.
Comparability
In line with the business strategy and organizational integration of A.P. Moller - Maersk, we report on sustainability performance as One Maersk. For Maersk Drilling and Maersk Oil sustainability data is not included in the year of separation from A.P. Moller - Maersk, while economic performance data is included up to the data of the demerger/ sale. Acquired and merged entities are excluded from sustainability reporting until the following reporting year.
Consolidation
For operational scope, 100% of the data reported from the operated assets is included irrespective of percentage ownership. Financial scope uses our financial consolidation methodology; data is collected per legal entity per activity, and the figures are consolidated line-by-line. Subsidiaries in which A.P. Moller - Maersk has full control are included 100%. Joint ventures and associated companies and other companies, in which
A.P. Moller - Maersk does not have control,
are excluded. Using financial consolidation principles allows us to compare sustainability indicators directly with financial data, thereby providing context for our performance.
Data categories and accuracy
A.P. Moller - Maersk has defined two categories of data: documented and probable data:
• Documented data comprises: our employees
(FTE), energy consumption, air emissions,
transport work (for EEOI), and financial data
• Probable data comprises: safety (fatalities and
LTIf), waste, water, spills, gender and nationality.
Documented data (financial and non-financial) is valid and complete and is essentially at the same quality level.
The reliability of probable data is somewhat lower but is still provided to the best of the management’s knowledge. It is based on data received and controlled in the consolidated reporting tool, but with an inherent risk of being incomplete.
Financially scoped probable data (water
and waste) must always be defendable, and
if assumptions are necessary due to lack of documentation, then the assumptions made must be verifiable. If no evidence exists, then assumptions based on the probable data must be made in writing and shall be verified by the reviewer, whereby the data are always defendable.
Operationally scoped probable data (safety and spills data), along with gender and nationality, has the weakest data quality, as it is not possible to ensure validity and completeness.
Emission conversions and calculations
GHG emissions are calculated indirectly via default conversion factors for energy consumption and other GHG gases.
Primary schemes used are API (updated 2009), DEFRA (updated 2020) and IEA (updated 2020). The principles for choosing among the schemes for default conversion factors are:
• Newest schemes are preferred, as are internationally recognised generic schemes
• A scheme must always be used in full.
Thus, no combined schemes are allowed unless specific elements were not included
in the primary scheme
• Specific industry schemes can be included when not in conflict with the above.

 A. P. Møller - Mærsk A/S engaged us to provide limited assurance on the Performance data stated on page 44 in the Sustainability Report of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S for the period January 1 – 31 December 2020 (the "Performance data").
Our conclusion
Based on the procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained, nothing came to our attention that causes us not to believe that the Performance data in the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report are free of material misstatements and prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Principles as stated on pages 46-47
(the *Sustainability Accounting Principles”).
This conclusion is to be read in the context of what we state in the remainder of our report.
What we are assuring
The scope of our work was limited to assurance over Performance data as stated on page 44 in the
A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report 2020. Scope 3 carbon emissions have not been in scope for our review of the 2020 Performance data.
Professional standards applied
and level of assurance
We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) ‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information’ and, in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions, in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 “Assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements”. Greenhouse Gas quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and
the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.
Our independence and quality control
We have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which includes independence and other ethical requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and
accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our work was carried out by an independent multidisciplinary team with experience in sustainability reporting and assurance.
Understanding reporting and
measurement methodologies
The Performance data need to be read and understood together with the Sustainability Accounting Principles on pages 46-47, which Management are solely responsible for selecting and applying. The absence
of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.
Work performed
We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Performance data. In doing so and based on our professional judgement, we:
• Conducted interviews with management at
corporate and Brand level responsible for the
sustainability strategy, management and reporting; • Performed an assessment of materiality and the
selection of topics for the Sustainability Report and
comparison to the results of a media search; • Read and evaluated reporting guidelines and
internal control procedures at corporate level and reporting entity level regarding the Performance data to be consolidated in the 2020 Sustainability Report;
• Conducted analytical review of the data and trend explanations submitted by all reporting entities to A.P. Moller – Maersk Accounting & Controlling for consolidation; and
• Evaluated evidence.
Statement on other sustainability information mentioned in the report
Management of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S is responsible for other sustainability information communicated in the 2020 Sustainability report. The other sustainability information on pages 4-43 of the Sustainability
report comprises the sections Introduction, Strategic sustainability priorities, Responding to a pandemic, Responsible business practices and Progress overview regarding A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S’ 2020 sustainability approach, activities and results.
Our conclusion on the Performance data on page 44 does not cover other sustainability information and we do not express an assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our review of the Performance data, we read the other sustainability information
in the 2020 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report and, in doing so, considered whether the other sustainability information is materially inconsistent with the Performance data or our knowledge obtained in the review or otherwise appear to be materially misstated. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Management’s responsibilities
Management of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S is responsible for:
• Designing, implementing and maintaining internal
control over information relevant to the preparation of the Performance data and information in the Sustainability Report that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
• Establishing objective Sustainability Accounting Principles for preparing Performance data; and
• Measuring and reporting the Performance data in the Sustainability Report based on the Sustainability Accounting Principles.
Our responsibility
We are responsible for:
• Planning and performing the engagement to obtain
limited assurance about whether the Performance data for the period 1 January – 31 December 2020 are free from material misstatements and are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Principles;
• Forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained; and
• Reporting our conclusion to the stakeholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S.

6 A.P. Moller - Maersk Sustainability Report 2019 Introduction Letter from our CEO
Letter from
our CEO
In the space of just one year, there has been
a step change in the commitment across society to sustainability. From government, banking institutions, investors, companies both big and small, to scientists, students and consumers, everyone is uniting in bringing increased awareness and finding solutions
to the pressing issues that are impacting our world.
A solid sustainability agenda by itself is simply not enough anymore. Sustainability
is expected by our customers to be a part of everyday business and embedded in everything we do. We are very pleased to take the next step in 2020 in embedding sustainability
into our company by anchoring the activities
in the business with direct business leader accountability for the results. With this move, we aim to make the pursuit of solutions that contribute to a better world a fundamental part of how we do business, firmly embedding sustainability into our processes and customer offerings in the years to come.
Changing the course on emissions
I am proud that we are deeply involved in the global sustainability agenda and have been for over a decade.
On climate change, our target is to have net-zero emissions from our shipping activities by 2050. In 2019 alone, we reached several important milestones towards this ambitious target. We determined where the vast majority of our investments in new fuels will go in
the next years, zooming in on three potential fuel types based on alcohols (methanol and ethanol), bio-methane and ammonia. On top of this, we launched a customer-backed coalition to develop a completely new type of biofuel that has potential to scale.
 
 Introduction This is how we work Progress and activities Progress summary Data and assurance 7
“We aim to make the pursuit of solutions that contribute to a better world a fundamental part of how we do business, firmly embedding sustainability into our processes and customer offerings in the years to come.”
In addition, we put a certified carbon-neutral shipping option on the market, and we were among the founders of the Getting to Zero alliance that will serve as a vehicle to accelerate the energy transition in shipping and beyond.
We also finalised preparations for the robust new limits on sulphur dioxide (SOx) coming
into force on 1 January 2020. Prior to this legislation, SOx pollution from shipping alone has been estimated to cause seven million asthma cases among children. We have been staunch supporters of this legislation from
the beginning, and I am proud that Maersk has contributed to the design of enforcement mechanisms that point to a level playing field.
Enabling open and inclusive trade
Sustainability, as reflected in the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, is about more than climate change and other environmental challenges. It is about poverty, decent jobs, sustainable production and consumption, infrastructure, hunger, life below water, gender equality, partnerships and more. Trade touches on all of these.
We are committed to enabling trade and to multiplying the benefits of trade so that more people, businesses and communities can be part of a global, open and inclusive trading system. We will therefore relentlessly work
to remove the friction and barriers that are disproportionally more difficult for smaller enterprises to overcome.
Our work centres on changing away from complex, paper-based and fragmented processes and towards creating sustainable and transparent end-to-end supply chains.
Our main contribution to this transition is to integrate our services to offer more sustainable trade options that are easier to access for
traders everywhere, and of any size. We do that by simplifying and digitising our own and our industry’s core business processes, and in 2019 98.2% % of all bookings were made online or in digital booking systems.
The digital platform TradeLens, through which we together with IBM enable participants to digitally connect, share information and collaborate across the supply chain, will soon include more than half of global container volume data. We are also driving forward Twill, a digital platform which allows customers to book, manage and monitor shipments online
– thereby making it simpler and easier for SMEs to engage in international trade. By 1 January 2020, Twill was available in 154 countries.
Offerings such as Maersk Spot, TradeLens and Twill are each tailored to meet the unique needs of specific customer segments, while creating a seamless experience and taking away the hassles of international trade. Finally, we pursue our strategy of expanding our Logistics & Services business on land.
Through the efforts of Maersk colleagues everywhere, we are today one company, moving towards serving as an integrated transport and logistics company handling the global supply chains of our 70,000 customers.
Making Maersk a safe place to work
We have changed our approach to safety. Launched one year ago, our Safety Differently strategy is increasingly visible throughout Maersk. A key shift has been our drive to empower our organisation to reduce the impact of safety incidents, which is today equally as important as prevention of any and all incidents, and across the company safety experts are engaging leaders and employees in this work.
Tragically, five people lost their lives while working for us in 2019. Each of these fatal accidents is deeply troubling for me and anyone who works for Maersk. By building capacity
to fail safely, we work to eliminate fatal and severe outcomes of accidents. We are hopeful that increasing the collaboration and dialogues around safety and creating an even stronger learning culture with clear safety leadership will have that impact.
Integrating sustainability
in the business
As we work to further embed responsibilities in our business, sustainability continues to play a vital role in A.P. Moller - Maersk and our ambition remains the same, as well as our continued commitment to our customers, our colleagues and all partners and stakeholders, to be an innovative and responsible global integrator of container logistics.

Strategy
During 2019, the A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk) organisational transformation into one company moved closer to completion. Integration of functions and governance mechanisms is now fully in place.
The transformation also implies a smooth fit between our business and sustainability strategies. We now have an organisational and governance system with fully charged decision- making capabilities and defined responsibilities to advance towards our goals.
Sustainability supports
the business strategy
Our business strategy is to become the global integrator of container logistics, providing
our customers with end-to-end services for a simplified and connected supply chain. In doing so, we are embracing change and enabling trade for a growing world.
When we updated our sustainability
strategy in 2017, we combined this ambition with our understanding of the most pressing sustainability challenges, where we believe Maersk – through our business – has the potential to make a real contribution to change.
The result was a strategy defined by four shared value commitments and based on responsible business practices (see graphical overview on next page). The strategy not only supports our commercial objectives, but also ensures we contribute meaningfully to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
The business of A.P. Moller - Maersk touches, directly or indirectly, on all 17 SDGs. Five SDGs are prioritised through our shared value commitments: SDGs 8, 9, 12, 13 and 17. For example, our work on food loss contributes directly to goal 12, in particular the sub-target 12.3 on food loss. Our work on responsible
ship recycling is a contributor towards goal
8 on decent work and economic growth. Decarbonising logistics will be a monumental contribution to goal 13 on climate action, and progress on trade will contribute to numerous sub-targets across the goals, in particular goals 8 and 91.
Governance supports progress
and accountability
In September 2019, a completely updated, comprehensive A.P. Moller - Maersk Code of Conduct for employees was launched, which also covers sustainability issues, including
Governance model
Board of Directors
Receives an annual update on sustainability and approves the Annual Sustainability Report
human rights, supplier relationships, labour standards, anti-corruption and environmental responsibility.
The Code of Conduct sets out expectations and requirements and links to the relevant internal governance rules called Commit Rules. In the Commit system, 35 rules determine the goals and boundaries for Maersk’s actions. Each rule has a designated owner in the organisation who is responsible for progress and accountable for reporting into the newly established cross- organisational Commit Council. This Council will oversee compliance and implementation with the Commit Rules and the Code of Conduct.

Task forces for shared value realisation
Each of the four shared value programmes in our sustainability strategy is guided by very ambitious goals that impact both our company and the world around us. We have established a task force for each programme headed by a Maersk executive and with members from the functions responsible for implementation.
The task forces approve the targets and main initiatives within each programme. For example, in 2019, the task force for multiplying the benefits of trade programme clarified the programme’s focus
to consist of driving progress and governance on the commitments to inclusive trade (see page 12), and applying Maersk’s capabilities to help small businesses connect to international trade. The latter part by combining Maersk’s presence in a given country with local partnerships to roll out end-to-end logistics solutions targeted at small and medium-sized companies.
Besides these task forces, we may also establish committees to guide and coordinate cross- functional work on specific issues. For example, we currently have a SOx steering committee, where members from 10 different functions across the company align and coordinate work in preparation for complying with new regulation on sulphur emissions effective on 1 January 2020.
Integration of sustainability into business
Over the past two years, we have worked to incorporate sustainability into our commercial and operations departments, making sustainability a much more integrated part of decision-making, discussions with customers and day-to-day business.
We took an additional step in this direction at the end of 2019, as we incorporated our shared value commitments further into our business. We have an unchanged sustainability agenda
in both scope and ambition level, and with
this further integration we aim to ensure that sustainability is a fundamental and inseparable part of how we do business.

In this section, we report on five sustainability issues
that currently affect our company more than all others, and that also draw high levels of interest amongst our stakeholders. These issues are how to make global trade benefit all, the climate crisis, the IMO 2020 sulphur cap, the health of oceans, and how the expansion of our business on land affects our supply chain responsibilities.
We report on how Maersk people everywhere in our global organisation work to grasp opportunities, resolve dilemmas and meet the challenges related to each of these issues.

How we aim
to improve and
enable trade
One morning in June 2019, Ayomide Oke from AgroEknor pulled into the new container freight station at Port of Onne, Nigeria. A dried hibiscus flower farmer, he was about to deliver a load of product for export.
Before the opening of the container freight station, located inside the A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk)-owned West Africa Container Terminal, the obstacles for AgroEknor to engage in export activities were daunting. He would have had
to face the bad road conditions, to organise container rental and stuffing, container trucking services to and from the port, and arrange for customs and other inspection agencies to come to the container freight station outside of the port – complex logistics challenges that most have neither the skills nor the time for.
Working with the people at Maersk’s container freight station, AgroEknor’s farmers do not have to deal with any of these tasks. Here storage, container stuffing, customs clearance and container weighing services are all provided under the same roof.
This service will help local farmers join international trade, and avoid situations in the past, where export containers sometimes arrived too late for vessels, which meant financial losses for farmers, and that their time-sensitive produce in a container became part of the loss statistics. For AgroEknor and Ayomide Oke,
exports mean growth in volume of business and income. Their service delivery to their clients has improved and members of their community have greater potential to improve their lives with sustained employment opportunities. For Nigeria, this one container freight station, the only one in East Nigeria, is a welcome contribution to the government’s push for more exports, particularly of agricultural products, in order to increase foreign exchange revenue, improve its balance of trade, and create employment opportunities.
Enabling trade is our core
As the global integrator of container logistics, Maersk moves 1 in every 5 containers in the world. It is our mission to connect and simplify supply chains to enable trade for our customers and for a growing world.
This goal of enabling trade drives innovations in booking processes and cargo management, digitising shipping’s entire paper trail, and offering our services from farm or factory to store or production facility and not only port to port.
In broader terms, it also drives our work to ensure that trade serves as a positive contributor to global and local development and growth, with a particular focus on enhancing opportunities for small and medium-sized traders.
In 2019, we completed a study of our impact on trade in 17 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
since 2007. We found that our investments in shipping and port connectivity have enabled trade worth USD 18 billion, creating the foundation for millions of jobs in the process. However, this number could have been much larger were it not for poor inland transport links and cumbersome border processes that hold back trade in Africa.
Globally, the cost of practical barriers like these are six times higher than the combined costs of global tariffs2. Reducing these supply chain barriers could boost global GDP by 5% and thereby add 20 million jobs to the global economy annually by 2030 – with the largest effects in developing countries3.
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have the greatest potential for improvement
in these scenarios, and societies stand to gain the most by improving the capacity of SMEs to trade. Today, 95% of all companies are SMEs and they account for up to 70% of all jobs4. They feature in most countries’ social and economic policy objectives and in the UN SDGs. However, for SMEs in developing countries, direct exports represent only 7.6% of sales compared to
14.1% for large manufacturing companies. In developed countries, SMEs account for 78% of exporting companies but only 34% of exports4.
As we empower small businesses in trade, we can help economies – and trade – become more inclusive.

We are in the business of trade and dedicated to enabling global trade for a growing world. Trade has the potential to create jobs and reduce poverty, and we work to extend these benefits to more people and countries by reducing barriers and frictions in trade.

12 A.P. Moller - Maersk Sustainability Report 2019 This is how we work Trade
Reducing complexity
A main barrier for participation in trade is the complexity of trade processes. This is why, in 2018, Maersk and IBM launched TradeLens, an open and neutral platform using blockchain technology in logistics. Currently, shipping companies representing more than half of global container trade have signed up to TradeLens, along with other critical players such as inland transportation providers, customs authorities and ports.
TradeLens’ potential to add value by simplifying trade was shown in an analysis of our terminal in Mumbai in India in 2019. The analysis showed that the kinds of solutions enabled by TradeLens can help reduce costs for exporters and importers by up to USD 260 million annually in Mumbai alone, equal to approximately 15% of total costs.
Empower small businesses
to benefit from trade
In support of the critical segment of SMEs and their access to global trade, we have
established a digital shipping platform, Twill, enabling SME customers to book, manage
and monitor shipments online, including
inland transportation and customs clearance. This reduces trade barriers such as lack of knowledge on how to trade, and lack of trust inside the existing trading system. In 2020, Twill will be live in 154 countries.
Women entrepreneurs hold particular promise in making trade work better for inclusive economic growth5. Since 2018, we have partnered with SheTrades, supporting their ambition of connecting three million women entrepreneurs to international markets by 2021 (see further activities in 2019 progress graphic).
Maersk is also investing in solutions that enable SMEs to access international trade and in turn create more and better jobs in their communities. One such example is the company Incodocs, an Australian start-up developing a solution to automate trade documentation for SMEs. Another example is Mofidi, a German start-up that works to develop a trade finance solution for small companies.
“I monitor all aspects very closely for our customers, who trust us to handle everything for them.”
Cathy Jones, working in Chicago, USA, provides end-to- end customer care for Twill customers. This includes planning, supplier coordination and collation of documentation for customs clearance through to final mile trucking delivery management at destination. Above all, Cathy’s primary objective is to manage all unexpected events and to take the necessary action in ensuring the on-time arrival of cargo.
Contribute to trade facilitation reforms in 30 developing countries by 2025.
By the end of 2019, we had contributed to reforms in 9 countries.
Through our participation in the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, we provide knowledge and data to enable reforms in developing countries.

Help level the global trading field
Companies in developing countries pay a particularly high price for informal barriers
to trade6, such as traffic congestion and administrative barriers, which cause delays and add costs. Trade facilitation reforms are needed to remove or reduce these added costs, and the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, which came into force in 2017, aims to do just that.
We are founding members of the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, a public-private partnership that supports reforms in developing and emerging economies. In 2019, the Alliance completed a project with Colombia’s National Food and Drug Surveillance Institute to establish a risk management system for food and beverage imports. This has reduced the average time for importing from two days to just three hours saving importers USD 8.8 million in the first 18 months.
In 2019, we engaged with UNCTAD and
the German government to develop a digital solution that will allow customs authorities in 100 developing countries worldwide to freely access digital shipping information directly from TradeLens. This can enable much faster processing of imports and exports.
 The dilemmas in sustainable consumption
The sustainability of global consumption patterns continue to be a much-debated topic. This is a highly complex issue, driven in particular by three interlinked challenges: the rise of the global middle class, planetary boundaries posing limits to growth and a growing call for more equity in how and by whom resources are owned and consumed.
In addition to a call for public policies to improve distribution of wealth and access to opportunity, the public debates on solutions to the challenge of sustainable consumption generally fall in one of three categories:
• an appeal for degrowth, i.e. reducing or
avoiding consumption,
• a call for innovations to deliver sustainable
growth within current economic models, and
• a call for new metrics and solutions in an
economic model that is beyond growth.
Dilemmas abound in discussions of sustainable consumption patterns, and there are big questions that both the public and private sector will need to find answers to. Among these are:
• What happens to job creation, livelihoods and stability if growth slows?
• What does degrowth mean – and is it necessary? And how will developing countries cope, when they already need 600 million jobs by 2030 just to keep up with population growth?
• What will new business models look like and who are the winners and losers in the transition to a green economy?
• How will the realisation of closed loop production and carbon free logistics change this debate?
We follow the development in this field avidly, as changes in consumption patterns could directly lead to changes in our business. The ultimate driver of the sustainable consumption debate is the green transition, and our most immediate role in this is linked to our role as a large-scale buyer and consumer of energy.
Consequently, we believe that our decarbonisation and inclusive trade efforts are the most relevant contributions we can make.
 Trade is good but not for me
There is solid evidence that trade is indispensable for poverty reduction7, supporting decent work8 and lowering the cost of living – particularly for low income groups9.
One question begs an answer, however: If open trade is so powerful, then why is it not more popular?
In a 2018 survey, 8 in 10 people said that trade is good for their country. But fewer than half believed that trade benefits them10.
This is not merely perception. In spite of trade’s benefits in general, many poorer countries have found it hard to develop domestic industries that can compete in global markets. And in high-income countries, open trade combined with new technologies has contributed to stagnating livelihoods for some groups of people.
The result is that when asked if they think trade is good, a typical answer seems to be “yes – but not for me”.

How we work towards
On 23 September 2019, Marcin Hartmann was doing his job as a chief engineer on the Mumbai Maersk. His main task is to keep moving the ship forward, taking our customers’ cargo to its agreed destination at the agreed time. His other task is to ensure that this is done with as low fuel costs and subsequent CO2 emissions as possible.
Using the StarConnect vessel optimisation tool, numerous graphs and data points on his desktop screen provide him with information to keep the main engine tuned and fuel efficient. He is setting all parameters to optimum cylinder pressures, adjusting engine load, checking the waste heat recovery system and more.
Marcin Hartmann is not alone in his attempts to lower emissions, save fuel and stick to the schedule. In Singapore sits Adithya Vishwanathan. Charts and maps with live monitoring of the more than 700 Maersk- operated vessels are on the walls of the room, where the Maersk voyage execution team
do their work. This team of 10 experienced seafarers works around the clock to support the vessels’ fuel consumption through input on route planning, optimisation of voyage strategies, and additional weather info.
On the second floor of our Copenhagen head office, Key Client Manager Klaus Schroeder Pagh was finalising an email to a customer, in this case Swedish retail giant H&M, hammering out some of the details in the agreement to use a new carbon-neutral biofuel offering for parts
of their cargo. Meanwhile on another floor, Mads Stensen, Senior Sustainability Developer was meeting with customers to discuss their participation in the LEO Project, set to develop a new type of biofuel.
Finally, on this same day, Maersk, represented by then Chief Operations Officer, Søren Toft,
was on stage at the United Nations Secretary General’s Climate Summit, launching the Getting to Zero Coalition and talking to world leaders about Maersk’s ambition to be a decarbonised, end-to-end logistics provider, and what we are doing to get there.
What all these Maersk colleagues share is the drive towards delivering on our two strategic targets for CO2:
1.
2.
New progress made in efficiency
When Marcin, the chief engineer on Mumbai Maersk, checks his StarConnect dashboard to lower fuel consumption, he contributes to two major, strategic goals for Maersk: cost optimisation and decreasing CO2 emissions.
decarbonising logistics
Our goal is to decarbonise our own operations by 2050 and in the process become as energy efficient as possible. In 2019, with a broad range of collaborations and partnerships, we were off to an encouraging start, and many people across our operations are working to support our transition.
 To have net-zero CO2 emissions from our own operations by 2050, which includes having commercially viable, net-zero vessels on the water by 2030.
To deliver a 60% relative reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 compared to 2008 levels.
“There are probably still opportunities to look for further adjustments to save fuels and CO2. We try to find out. We try to do this all the time, wherever we can.”

Working towards 60% CO2 efficiency improvement
 We made new progress on our relative reduction target in 2019.

2008
In 2019, we changed the indicator underlying our relative CO2 reduction target. Instead of the previous indicator, which used average-based assumptions to calculate emissions, we now use the EEIO indicator based on our actual operational performance11. The result is more accurate data and calculations of impact, and alignment with what we suggest become the indicator to be used to measure progress on the IMO efficiency targets. All data from 2008 and onwards has been restated, and numbers in this report are therefore not directly comparable with numbers in previous reports. The reduction target and performance data in the charts above is related to our shipping operations. The peak in absolute emissions in 2017 is due to the acquisition of Hamburg Süd.

  Focusing on these goals has resulted in a 41.8% relative reduction in CO2 emissions since 2008, with 2019 progress showing a 3.2% improvement towards the 2008 baseline,
and a 5.2% improvement relative to the 2018 level. We expect further improvement in the coming years, and we are well on track for
our 60% reduction target in 2030. Reductions are achieved through technical retrofitting and by improving planning and optimising of networks. In 2019, we introduced the bunker crusade-programme, where anyone in Maersk who is involved in moving goods from one port to another chases ways to improve efficiency and drive out waste in the use and purchase of bunker fuel. The crusade focuses on improved use of data, increased collaboration and coordination over route scheduling.
Had we not worked on these efficiency measures, our emissions would have mirrored our business growth. While emissions have grown in absolute numbers, we have decoupled growth in business from CO2 emission levels
as seen in the graphic above. In total, we have thereby avoided emissions of 152,480,433 tonnes of CO2 over the period 2008–2019, equal to more than 32 million average size cars being taken off the roads for a year12.
Decarbonising is the only way forward
Every year the World Economic Forum publishes its list of the most pressing global risks. In 2020, the top five risks in terms of
likelihood are all related to climate and climate- related environmental issues. The shipping industry contributes about 2–3% of the world’s emissions. If shipping were a country, it would be the world ́s sixth-biggest greenhouse gas emitter.
As seen in the graphs above, improving efficiency is not enough. Even with 41.8% efficiency gains, absolute emissions remain roughly flat. In addition to efficiency, we must introduce carbon-neutral propulsion technologies that will work on long voyages at sea.
In December 2018 we communicated our ambition to have carbon-neutral marine operations by 2050, far beyond any regulatory frameworks in place today, and in line with the Paris Agreement.
To get to net-zero emissions, we know that breakthroughs will need to happen in at least three areas: market, technology and legislation.
Starting to move the market
Through partnerships with key market players, we will test and launch new products to drive demand and change price perceptions.
Biodiesels play a key role in the transition phase, as an element in establishing and growing the market for carbon-neutral transport and to build acceptance of diversified pricing dependent on carbon footprint.
In 2019, we piloted a new fuel made from used cooking oil, certified by the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification body.
“Comparatively, the main challenge in decarbonising shipping is not at sea but on land. The technological changes inside the vessels are minor compared to the massive innovative solutions and fuel transformation that must take place in the fuel supply chains to produce and distribute entirely new energy sources.”

This is how we work
Decarbonising logistics
The fuel is carbon neutral from a vessel perspective and saves an estimated 85% CO2 on a life-cycle basis, including all emissions from the production, transportation and combustion of the fuel.
First use of the fuel was on a Triple-E vessel travelling from Rotterdam to Shanghai, in collaboration with a group of global companies in the Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition.
Following the successful conclusion of this pilot, we launched the Maersk ECO Delivery ocean product, where the carbon footprint
of cargo transported under this name will be neutralised through use of carbon neutral biofuels in the Maersk network. The end-to- end process is verified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials.
Focusing in on viable technologies
We will co-develop decarbonised fuel
types together with technology developers, researchers, investors, customers and other shipping companies and logistics providers.
In 2019, we completed the first step on this journey by mapping available pathways and possible technologies for carbon neutral shipping. For this project we collaborated with Lloyds Register, University Maritime Advisory Services and DTU, Technical University of Denmark. It resulted in the development of three working hypotheses on future fuels: alcohol (ethanol and methanol), biomethane and ammonia.
Each option has its benefits and challenges: • For alcohol and biomethane, the main
advantage is the relatively simple transition
Distribution of emissions 2019
Scope 1 Scope 2 Scope 3
We invest and focus where we see the
greatest potential for impact. For CO2
emissions there is no contest: A study
indicating the order of magnitude of
each scope show that approximately
two thirds of our CO2 emissions are
related to our own operations (scope 1)
and roughly 97% of these come from
powering our vessels. Indirect emissions
from the generation of purchased 1% energy (scope 2) are negligible, while
emissions that occur in the value chain (scope 3) account for approximately one third13.
 from existing ship designs and infrastructure, whereas the main drawback is uncertainty about the availability of biomass feedstock as demand increases. For biomethane there is the additional challenge of methane leaks, which is a greenhouse gas 30 times more potent than CO2.
For ammonia the main advantage is that it can be 100% carbon free, and its scalability and the flexibility of production pathways
as it can be produced from both natural gas combined with carbon capture and storage, as well as from renewable electricity. The main drawback is related to safety as ammonia
is toxic. It also presents itself as the more

disruptive transition in terms of replacing existing vessels and infrastructure.
To meet the deadline of a commercially viable net-zero vessel at sea by 2030, we must pro- actively pursue the most likely fuel options found at this stage. Towards 2023, we will primarily invest in developing fuel solutions within each of the three pathways. However, our door remains open to other ideas.
In 2019, we also established the LEO coalition, working to develop a new bioethanol for shipping based on lignin and ethanol. Lignin is isolated in large quantities as a byproduct of the production of some types of bioethanol,
Working with energy use in ports
Emissions from purchased energy (scope 2) constitute only one percent of Maersk’s total emissions. We mainly purchase electricity, and our port terminals consume 80% of this. In January 2020, we launched Green Gateway Gothenburg as a showcase for decarbonisation of existing terminals. With renewable electricity and use of biodiesel made from recycled waste vegetable oils, the Gothenburg terminal will reduce its CO2 emissions by 90% from 1 January 2020. Ways to eliminate the last 10% of emissions are being pursued with terminal customers, to provide a fully CO2 neutral container handling service.
Other paths are being tested as well, with solar projects in Pipavav, India and Aqaba, Jordan and grid optimisation trial projects in two further sites.

 How we work to protect business value from climate change effects
In 2019, the Panama Canal – the main nexus of trade between the Atlantic and Pacific
– suffered the worst drought in its 115-year history. Water levels were so low that some ships had to unload part of their cargo to pass through the waterway.
Changes in weather patterns cause
these challenges, and the Panama Canal’s management is working to find a lasting solution. In the short term, canal customers will need to rely on information on canal conditions to evaluate network options of transiting via the Panama or the Suez Canal when they are loading ships in Asia. This adds uncertainty to our customers’ supply chain and in our network planning.
These challenges put our business value
at risk in new ways, and illustrate why the financial community’s interest in climate change is rising rapidly. Investors, lenders, insurers and
Governance
Climate-related risks and opportunities are part of our Enterprise Risk Management system reporting to the Executive Leadership Team and the Board of Directors quarterly.
Our transition work, including our CO2 reduction target and efforts to decarbonise logistics, is governed by a task force owned by and headed by a member of our Executive Leadership Team.
Strategy
Our strategy is to take leadership in decarbonising shipping. It is a high-profile low-CAPEX strategy, as it needs a full transition to new net-zero fuels. The energy sector, in particular, is needed to create these solutions, and therefore it is crucial to send a clear message to the actors that will develop the solutions that we as the end consumer are ready to collaborate to identify these fuels.
Furthermore, it is a key pillar of our strategy to involve our customers not only as partners in R&D projects but also already now offer a differentiated net-zero ocean transportation product.
We work proactively and in partnerships to make sure the right policies will be in place to support the transition. More is described in this report on pages 14–19.
more want to ensure that business leaders understand and are preparing for the effects of climate-related events on their business.
The shipping industry is impacted by this momentum in a number of ways.
One example is the establishment of the Poseidon Principles, where signatories commit to factor in an applicant’s emission reductions history in lending decisions.
This new reality requires public and comprehensive reporting on climate change strategies and risk management. We do this using the reporting framework prepared by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This includes transition risks, understood as risks and opportunities from realigning the global economic system towards low-carbon or carbon-neutral solutions, as well as the impacts of physical risks caused by changes in weather patterns.
Risk management
We performed a hot-spot analysis in 2018, estimating the effect of five climate hazards (heat stress, floods, cyclones, water stress and sea level rise) on ports, other fixed assets and strategic commodities within a 2020–2040 timeframe.
Building on this, in 2019, we took steps to perform an economic analysis and engage with stakeholders in the Pearl River Delta, which was established as a hot-spot. We will finalise this analysis and report on it in 2020. This work will be instrumental in evolving our approach to managing physical risk from climate change.
Our engagement with customers, investors and lenders in relation to framework conditions for shipping is part of managing the risk of encountering first mover disadvantages. New net zero fuels are likely to be more expensive than the current fuels. For our vision of commercially viable net zero vessels being ready in 2030, it is crucial to get the right framework conditions in place.
Metrics and targets
The distribution of our CO2 emissions is presented on page 16. Our target is to
have net-zero CO2 emissions from our own operations in by 2050. To decouple growth in volume from emissions, we have a target of 60% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030, compared to 2008. Targets for managing the physical impacts of climate change are not available yet.
  and at pulp and paper mills. Currently lignin
is often incinerated to produce steam and electricity. If trials are successful, however, LEO fuel has the potential to be a viable solution for today and not just a future vision. Testing on actual vessel engines will begin in 2020. The coalition consists of Maersk and Wallenius Wilhelmsen, University of Copenhagen and major customers, including BMW Group, H&M Group, Levi Strauss & Co. and Marks & Spencer.
The need for good policies
In addition to the industry focus on innovation, we also need legislators and governing bodies to develop and implement policy tools that drive development towards carbon-neutral societies. Together with peers, we will work to ensure that framework conditions are relevant and proportional to the challenges.
Launching the Getting to Zero coalition in 2019, in a partnership among Global Maritime Forum, the World Economic Forum, and Friends of Ocean Action, was an important step in this direction. This coalition is meant to be the catalyst for the required energy transition. It is also an important vehicle towards regulatory frameworks that reward the most ambitious companies in this field.
At present there is a clear competitiveness gap between fossil and zero-emission fuels. This needs to be closed, which requires political action.
There are several possible policy tools available to do this, including carbon levy and subsidies for carbon-neutral fuels, and we will be following developments in this area closely to prepare our business to be able to comply with new demands. As always, our main concern is that regulatory measures create a level playing field and do not punish first movers.

20 A.P. Moller - Maersk Sustainability Report 2019 This is how we work Air emissions
How we prepared
For many people, their day begins with shower, breakfast and the weather forecast. For inhabitants of Shanghai, there is one more factor to consider: the continuously updated air quality index.
Why? Because Shanghai and its surrounding Yangtze River Delta suffers from high levels of air pollution, creating health risks at potentially the same level as tobacco14. The area is also host to one of the busiest port clusters in the world. And there is a link15.
A recent study has shown that ship-related global health impacts include approximately 137,000 premature deaths from lung cancer and cardiovascular disease and around
7 million childhood asthma cases annually.
The same study estimates that lower sulphur fuels in shipping will significantly reduce both these numbers16.
Our target is to always comply with and to aid in ensuring global enforcement of regulations. In 2019, we had five cases of non-compliance with sulphur dioxide (SOx) emissions in regulated zones, caused by errors during fuel switch.
The biggest change in decades
The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 0.5% global cap on the content of sulphur
in fuels came into effect at the turn of the
year from 2019 to 2020. The health benefits described are why we have been supportive of
this legislation since it was established in 2008. It is enforced through a ban on carrying non- compliant fuels on vessels, except for vessels where scrubbers cleaning the exhaust gasses are installed.
This regulation has been termed the biggest single change in the shipping industry in decades, because the entirety of the world’s shipping fleet was required to either switch
to using a different fuel type or have new equipment installed at the same time. And because the difference in cost between compliance and non-compliance is so high, the actual change is being performed close to the enforcement date.
for IMO 2020
As of 1 January 2020, all the vessels in the world must comply with a global cap on the content of sulphur in fuel oil, also known as IMO 2020. It has been described as the maritime industry’s biggest single change in decades.
How we prepared for compliance
Preparing for IMO 2020, we established six workstreams, each of which addressed key areas in the change process.
               Fuel sourcing
where colleagues
in our Oil Trading department monitored the fuel market for price developments and secured sufficient supply of compliant, low-sulphur fuels.
Cost recovery
where our
Ocean Products department through extensive dialogue with customers worked to adjust our pricing models to recover some of the additional fuel costs with our customers.
Operational implementation where our Fleet Technology department collaborated with our oil trading department on bunkering of compliant fuel and switchover procedures, and created schedules for scrubber installations.
Network strategy
where our Network department determined where our vessels would
be deployed by 1 January 2020, and which ships would be eligible for installation of scrubbers.
Time Charter
where our Chartering department worked to ensure alignment between the owners of vessels we charter and our compliance approach.
Regulatory
where our regulatory affairs team worked to monitor regulatory changes, had dialogue with authorities and the IMO to ensure effective enforcement while clarifying regulatory questions.

 Introduction This is how we work Progress and activities Progress summary Data and assurance
21
There has never been any question of whether Maersk will comply with the global cap. Only about how we could prepare in a way that enables us to ensure compliance with
this legislation, that will reduce our negative environmental impacts significantly, and minimise financial risk to our business due to the significant extra fuel costs.
The vast majority of our approximately
700 ships comply with the global sulphur cap through the use of compliant low-sulphur fuels. A small share of our vessels have open-loop scrubbers installed. Open-loop scrubbers use sea water with no added chemicals to wash
the exhaust gases to remove SOx. Closed-loop systems use fresh water with an additive. The health and environmental impacts of both closed and open-loop scrubbers are being investigated by the IMO. We clearly favour tackling sulphur at land-based refineries rather than on vessels at sea. However, in the current state of uncertainty over the price and supply of compliant fuel, we have chosen to use scrubbers as a secondary part of our approach to compliance.
Planning with uncertainty
One of the main challenges in preparing for
the global cap was uncertainty. All shipowners and operators were switching fuel types or installing scrubbers at the same time. The plans for doing this are highly business sensitive and for that reason, the demand side for fuels and scrubbers has not been clear.
At the same time, the price and supply of the new compliant fuels are still unknown. What we do know is that the price of low-sulphur fuels is much higher.
As a consequence, industry supply and demand are unpredictable and fuel prices volatile. This situation makes purchasing the
right amount of fuel to meet our delivery promises highly challenging, and it increases the amount of buffer fuel we need to purchase and store. It also makes it difficult for our customers to accurately predict their fuel cost or to have confidence that they are not under- or over- paying for fuel as fuel costs are passed on.
The enforcement knot untied for now
How to enforce the ban and monitor compliance for all vessels has been the subject of high-level negotiations in the IMO in the past years. Maersk has made significant efforts in pushing for a high level of compliance measures with the IMO, states and ports to ensure we compete on a level playing field.
In 2019, new strides were made to change the way enforcement at sea can be carried out. Previously, a country could only apply sanctions to non-compliances with maritime law carried out within 200 miles from the country’s
border. To enable enforcement of the global cap on SOx, it will now be possible to base a penalty on the savings a shipowner makes on the entire journey instead. That increases the size of potential penalties considerably, which is believed to be a far stronger deterrent of recurring non-compliant behaviour. Maersk lent expertise to the negotiations leading to this change.
SOx is the first wave
In a broader perspective, the global cap on sulphur is the first example of establishing a mechanism for pricing negative effects on the environment.
Through dialogue and collaboration,
Maersk has developed new pricing mechanisms that pass on higher fuel costs to customers
in what we think is a fair, predictable and understandable way. One bases the fuel price on average prices in key bunkering ports around the world, while the other adds an environmental fuel fee.
In that way, we see the preparations for SOx compliance as a learning opportunity for the next waves of regulations and cost sharing that will come. This will take place around not only but most importantly CO2, as the shipping industry sets out to deliver on the CO2 targets set by the IMO.
 “IMO 2020 is an important step to reduce sulphur emission in the maritime industry. It, however, comes with a cost for Maersk, as compliant fuel is more expensive than traditional bunker oil. A concern is whether Maersk will be able to compensate these costs through higher freight rates. This is important to secure profitability. Maersk is working very actively with the sustainability agenda not only relating to IMO2020 but also on other issues. We are convinced that Maersk’s ambition to be at the forefront regarding sustainability will create long-term shareholder value.”

Ocean health
 How we
care for
In April 2019, five buoys were dropped into
the South Pacific as Olivia Maersk sailed from Balboa in Panama to Tauranga in New Zealand. These buoys are high-tech weather instruments collecting marine environment data on temperatures and currents.
Contributing to research initiatives is one of the ways we support and care for the oceans. We see ourselves as citizens of the oceans and we want to actively participate in restoring their health and resilience. We are further obligated to act, as emissions from our activities contribute to acidification and rising ocean temperatures. Read about our work to decarbonise our operations on pages 14–19 of this report, and to significantly lower SOx-emissions on pages 20–21.
A rule book for oceans and companies
In September 2019, the United Nations Global Compact launched a set of nine Sustainable Ocean Principles, calling on companies around the world to commit to securing a healthy and productive ocean. We were founding signatories to the principles and have contributed to their development.
Signatory companies commit to preventing pollution, managing their use of marine resources to ensure long-term sustainability, and being transparent about their ocean- related activities and impacts.
A set of practical guidance documents to support companies in different sectors were published in January 2020.
Ocean health is deteriorating
The global oceans cover 71% of Earth’s surface and contain about 97% of its water. They redistribute CO2 and heat, supply people and communities with food, water, renewable energy, and build livelihoods through tourism, trade and transport17.
Now and in the next decade, oceans will become the object of increasing attention. The years 2021–2030 have been named as the ‘UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development’. And with good reason.
Today, climate change is heating the oceans and altering their chemistry dramatically. The health of the ocean is rapidly deteriorating due to increasing temperatures, acidification, depletion of natural resources and pollution from land and sea, including large quantities of plastic waste.
Conversely, as the world population grows towards 10 billion people there is a need to expand our use of the oceans to produce food, energy, raw materials and for transport.
The global community’s knowledge and understanding of oceans is insufficient to match these challenges.

Doing no harm
Our first obligation as citizens of the oceans is to comply with existing rules and regulations that safeguard ocean health. For Maersk, this includes managing fuels or chemical substances to avoid spills into water, managing waste to keep it out of the oceans and living up to the requirements of the ballast water management convention.
For each of these areas we have policies and procedures in place to manage and mitigate risks. Our 2019 performance can be seen in the graphic.
While not yet a regulatory requirement,
the increase in underwater noise is of growing concern, because all marine life from plankton to whales react to noise. The most prominent and documented example of this is how ship noise impacts and confuses the communication of a particular type of orca whales, an endangered species. As part of our retrofit programme for vessels, we have made changes that reduce the noise levels. Sailing at slower speeds is believed to reduce underwater noise. We participate in established speed reduction programs and studies in waters where whales are identified to be present.
Building knowledge
Maersk vessels have been deploying data- collecting buoys across the world’s oceans over the past two years, and all our vessels are authorised to participate in these activities. In total, 19 buoys have been launched from our vessels in 2019.
The data collected by these buoys is sent
to the World Ocean Council and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the US. From here it is made available to a wide range of organisations that use it to enhance predictions of changes in weather and climate.
This is part of our commitment to support ocean science research.
Contributing to removing
plastic from the oceans
Every day, our seafarers see the growing issue of plastic pollution first hand from our vessels. An estimated five trillion pieces of plastic waste are littering all major ocean basins and this problem feels close to home for both our company and our employees.
As such, it is rewarding to see our capabilities being used to help alleviate the problem, as they are in the Maersk partnership with The Ocean Cleanup. Since 2018, we have supported this ambitious and innovative organisation on their mission to start removing plastics from our oceans.
In June 2019, the supply service vessel Maersk Transporter left Vancouver, Canada
to be deployed in the North Pacific, pulling a long floater resting on the water’s surface with skirts hanging beneath it. Our vessel pulls this technology developed by The Ocean Cleanup, concentrating the plastic making it ready
for collection. In addition to providing a fully crewed vessel, our partnership agreement with The Ocean Cleanup covers project management, the use of 10 containers and safety training for all project staff travelling on the vessel.
In 2020, we will continue our partnership and further explore ways to collaborate on the extension of The Ocean Cleanup to rivers. Because while collecting what is already in the oceans is an important task, preventing future build-up is crucial to solving the ocean plastic problem. The Ocean Cleanup’s ambition is to tackle plastic in 1,000 rivers by 2025 through partnership-based clean-ups.
Sailing through the Arctic
One of the unfortunate consequences of increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere, is the
melting of the Arctic ice cap. As a result, it has become possible to sail through the Northern Sea route for a few months during summer. On the one hand this can cut thousands of miles off shipping routes between Europe and Asia, reducing transport time and CO2 emissions. On the other hand, it is currently associated with severe environmental risks.
In 2018, we sent a vessel from Asia to Europe using the Northern Sea Route. Based on this trial our conclusion is that the Northern Sea Route is not a viable alternative to our current routes.
Implementation of new procedures for handling flexitanks and a new flexible hydraulic hose management strategy. This will continue in 2020.

24 A.P. Moller - Maersk Sustainability Report 2019 This is how we work End-to-end logistics
How we tackle responsibility and
opportunities on land
We are expanding our logistics activities on land. As part of
this process, we are exploring how to embrace our customers’ expectations of us to manage the sustainability of their supply chains while also capturing new opportunities. It is about securing responsible business practices in our end-to-end services.
Since January 2019, Maersk handles all of LG Electronics India’s inland business needs. To secure this contract, our people invested time in understanding and mapping the import processes of LG Electronics, including suppliers and their factories, conducted a pilot to better understand the challenges on the ground and established back-to-back service agreements with rail and road vendors. According to LG Electronics India, this solution has reduced transit time and made their supply chain more visible and predictable.
This effort is a direct consequence of Maersk’s strategy to expand our activities on land. As the global integrator of logistics, our aim is to offer our customers end-to-end supply chain solutions that are an attractive contrast to the current situation, where customers must deal with, negotiate and exchange information with as many as five different companies to get their cargo from origin to destination.
Maersk teams across the world are in the process of developing similar solutions to what colleagues did for LG Electronics India. And with their success comes increased need for managing the logistics backbone that enables end-to-end solutions, namely warehouses, container freight stations, intermodal, road and rail transport options, and customs clearance agents.
Working on land is not new territory to us, as we have operated ports, logistics , warehousing and trucking for many years. With the growth of end-to-end logistics in our business, however, we are in the process of contracting more
and more of these services which are mostly operated by third parties. In some cases, we opt for mergers and acquisitions of companies in these fields.
Customers want more than simplicity
For our key customers, choosing end-to-end solutions from Maersk is not only about simplicity. It is also about sustainability. From our research we know that almost three quarters of our key customers seriously consider sustainability issues when managing their supply chain, and they are increasingly setting ambitious and science-based targets to drive performance.
In 2019, we conducted a study to gain a better understanding of what our customers expect of us when it comes to managing sustainability risks in their supply chain as a provider of end-to-end logistics. The study tells us that they want:

We include sustainability considerations in our expansion by using a reference tool developed for this very purpose, integrating issues such as environmental and community impacts, health and safety, technology, tax, labour standards, in the investment due diligence. If a sustainability related risk is thought to be material to the investment, it will be included in the proposal made for the Maersk investment committee.

Tracking cargo from
a customer’s perspective
The customer insights were part of a larger piece of research into end-to-end responsibility. This included a desk research-based global mapping of potential sustainability issues in key inland logistics segments – warehousing and distribution, trucking/intermodal, customs clearance, and terminals – as well as research into best practice sustainable supply chain management approaches.
Furthermore, we carried out an on-the- ground study, in collaboration with H&M Group, of sustainability issues on land across a route managed by Maersk’s supply chain management team. The illustration below shows some of the issues that were found in this study to be the most challenging to address.
The insights from the research will inform our overall approach to sustainable supply chain management and provide a foundation for developing stronger value propositions to our customers in the inland segments.
“H&M Group has been working with sustainability for many years since it’s a key aspect on how to run our business.
We believe that to be successful, collaboration with global companies that share similar values and ambitions in regards to sustainability, are key. We have a good approach to ensure compliance and progress towards our sustainability ambitions at our production sites, but we rely on business partners such as Maersk when it comes to transport of our containers from the container freight station to the terminals or on the ships. As one of the biggest transport providers in the world we trust Maersk to lead the change in this part of our shared value chain.”

Familiar landscape
The risks and opportunities we observed in our customers’ supply chains, including in warehouses, mirror what we know from our own supply chain. What is new is the scale at which they are becoming part of our value chain and business offerings, and how unequivocally our customers expect us to manage these on their behalf.
Our current approach to supply chain issues revolves around our responsible procurement programme which is described in more detail on
page 34. The programme is currently focused on managing our own risks and opportunities through contractual and control measures such as our Third-Party Code of Conduct, including due diligence processes, pre-qualifier assessments and audits.

  Encouraging a safety culture in third-party ports
Chattogram Port handles more than 90% of Bangladesh’s imports and exports, and Maersk vessels call there several times every week. This brings with it a bustle of activities, as cargo moves to and from vessels, trucks and rail.
Maersk is the biggest vessel operator in Chattogram, accounting for 20–30% of all calls to the port.
The port has introduced many measures to tackle congestion and safety. However, it remains a high- risk environment. To support these activities, Maersk hosted a half-day course for key officials in the local port authority and the managers of the seven stevedore companies that provide the labour in the port.
The course discussed the importance of upholding a culture
of safety and explained the most common causes of injuries and fatalities in ports, as reminders on what port workers should watch out for.
In total, the safety drive provided training for around 600 people. Maersk has since provided support for equipment and further training, and there are ongoing plans to develop the culture of safety at the port in collaboration with the port authority.
procurement categories. For example, from 2018–2019 we offered training for nearly 650 relevant employees on hiring through third- party labour providers. This has been a joint effort between our responsible procurement and employee relations programmes.
Working with trucking
For procurement of trucking, in 2018 we established a pre-qualifier questionnaire aligned with contracting realities in trucking. Building on this, in 2019 our responsible procurement team enhanced the control mechanisms in this category by including local health, safety, security and environment (HSSE) staff in the network of colleagues working on monitoring working conditions for truck drivers working in our supply chain.
Taking steps to drive collaborative impact within the trucking industry, in 2019 we have joined twelve other carriers and shippers as members of the Responsible Trucking platform. This project aims to take the lead and make collective efforts to drive compliance and improvement of the working conditions of
road transport workers. The group focuses on the European trucking industry, and we will use the learnings from this work to inform our approach across our global activities.
Working with terminals
Another high-risk category is the use of third- party terminals. In 2019, media reports made us aware of issues related to working conditions for labourers in the Port of Mombasa, Kenya, a port we do not operate, and we investigated the issues and followed up with mitigating actions (see text box).
From our own terminals business, we understand very well that safety is of the utmost importance and the challenges of ensuring safe operations. This year, we have worked to support one of the third-party terminals used by our business, Chattogram port in Bangladesh, with safety training and expertise as described in the case story.
Exploring additional approaches
As our end-to-end supply chain business grows, it will become increasingly important for us to find effective ways for driving improvements
in the parts of the supply chain where we
have low levels of contractual and operational controls. Adding to the intricacy is the fact that many of the societal risks may be rooted in deeply engrained systemic and cultural practices.
In 2020, we will work to further clarify and map our current controls and to explore potential levers and approaches for driving risk management and responsibility in our customers’ inland supply chains.
While the classic procurement tools such
as codes of conduct, self-assessments and audits are a good starting point, they may
have limited effectiveness in terms of driving significant change and impact on the ground. We will therefore also be exploring options related to capacity building and partnerships, technology-driven monitoring tools, new sustainable products and new procurement controls, systems and practices. As part of these new pursuits, dialogue with our customers to understand their challenges and priorities will contribute to driving and informing our work.
 The port of Mombasa: Knowledge allows for action
Late in 2018, we were made aware of observations of poor working conditions for contracted labourers in the port of Mombasa in Kenya, a port that we do not operate but which our ships are calling.
Earlier in 2018, we had sent our responsible procurement assessment questionnaire
to the operators of a selection of such
ports, including the port of Mombasa. This questionnaire examines, among other things, whether salary, working hours and safety meet Maersk’s requirements.
We immediately launched an investigation of the working conditions in the port of Mombasa. The observations brought to us
indicated that our usual control measures in this case had not functioned satisfactorily, and we took action to address this.
The most important steps taken were to adjust our contract with the supplier under investigation to ensure workers are paid
legal wages, and the launch of a series of improvement actions regarding working conditions. We also initiated a review of all contracts in the Mombasa region and similar contracts across various other ports in Africa, strengthening our risk management through specific trainings for our staff on the ground, and equipping them with knowledge to better detect any such violations.

We are also able to include a wider range of sources for discussing and assessing materiality, and we achieve better guidance on how a given issue should be managed, compared to the more traditional materiality matrix18.
This materiality approach, which we
have applied for four years, means that we are already applying the concept of double materiality which was introduced by the EU Commission in their updated guidance for non-financial reporting in 2019. To include investor needs more fully in reporting, the guidance clarifies that non-financial reporting should include not only material societal risks

 (in Maersk’s approach called ‘responsibility issues’), but also material risks to the business, particularly the potential or actual impacts
of climate-related risks and opportunities on the performance, development and position of a company. We have begun work to be able to perform this type of reporting (read more on page 17 about the physical impacts of climate change), and we have increased our engagement with investors.
Stakeholder engagement
For our materiality analysis and sustainability strategy, we give priority to five stakeholder groups: customers, employees, investors, authorities, and NGOs/thought leaders.
Maersk’s issue owners and business leaders engage with external stakeholders from each of these groups as part of their daily work. Sometimes informally through encounters at conferences or consultations on a particular subject, for example the WTO Public Forum, the Global Maritime Forum Annual Summit and the UN Forum on Business and Human Rights. Other engagements are more formal such
as participation in industry or issue fora, for example on tax or climate, or Maersk-organised events and outreaches such as twice-annual investor calls on ESG issues or customer insight surveys.
We particularly increased our engagement on sustainability with three groups in 2019:
• Customers, where we partnered widely
on activities to drive our decarbonisation ambition, among these activities to develop new offerings using biofuels. (read more on page 15–16). We also conducted customer research and collaborated with one customer to map sustainability implications of our expansion on land. (read more on page 25.)
• The financial community, whose interest in climate change has increased significantly. In regard to Maersk, investors are particularly interested in the implications of our decarbonisation targets on our business performance and financial stability.
Our dialogues with investors, banks and insurers centre around capital expenditure requirements, asset depreciation and security, as well as cost and risk sharing in market and technology development for net-zero shipping.
• Employees, where we in 2019 developed virtual communities using platforms such
as Yammer, and carried out six townhall events and workshops in three different regions, communicating what Maersk is doing globally on sustainability, how regions can leverage sustainability commercially and
how employees can engage locally. We also leveraged our partnership with The Ocean Cleanup as a platform for local employee engagement around the world on World Cleanup Day on 21 September 2019.
We are part of a broad and expanding range of partnerships to which we contribute actively and gain knowledge that informs our strategy and programmes. This includes for example the Sustainable Airfreight Alliance, the Global Logistics Emissions Council, and Clean Cargo. An important addition in 2019 was the establishment of the Getting to Zero coalition (read more on page 17). More key partnerships are shown on the right.
We are also active members of industry organisations such as Danish Shipping, the Baltic and Nordic Maritime Organisation, and the World Shipping Council. We communicate regularly with issue experts in the International Maritime Organization and other UN agencies, as well as national agencies on sustainability topics, for example the Danish Institute of Human Rights.
Partnerships
We remain engaged in a wide range of partnerships and members of different organisations.

30 A.P. Moller - Maersk Sustainability Report 2019 Progress and activities Safety
Safety
Safety Differently is Maersk’s new approach
to safety, which we developed in 2018 and began implementing in 2019. The approach
was anchored in the One Maersk Safety Transformation strategy in 2019. This new strategy reflects the fundamental change set out last year in how we approach safety, based on the belief that safety reflects the presence of capacity to manage risk in variable conditions, and that it must be enacted through leadership responsibility towards workers rather than paperwork and compliance alone. Even with many prevention measures in place, accidents may still happen due to uncertainty and change; and it is our people, not rules and instructions, that hold the insight as to how we can create a safe working environment.
Our safety targets now reflect the positive attention we put on engaging with workers, building capacity and promoting a learning culture. The targets highlight not the absence of accidents, but the presence of capacity and effective controls to eliminate as many of the factors contributing to the occurrence of accidents as possible and managing the outcome of an accident.
Reconnecting to frontline needs
Our senior leaders’ daily routine involves planning resources, setting budgets and making operational decisions that may directly or indirectly impact the safety of our people. For our leaders to support the safety needs of frontline workers, they need to openly engage with them during frontline operations to listen to what helps and hinders them. This builds trust and helps our leaders to understand the safety risks the workers are facing. We have built learning and engagement programmes for our leadership to enable just that.
To build capacity for safer operations, greater insight was needed about how work must be
“The people working on our vessels or at our terminals know the real dangers and are the best source for insights on how to manage the critical risks. We want to listen and
ask what they need, and to treat workers as the solution to continuous improvement, not the problem.” Tim Smith, Manager of APM Terminals for South Asia
done by our frontline rather than how risk control is imagined in procedures and instructions. To do this, we implemented an approach called learning teams, where frontline participation now enables learning about critical operational risks to inform improvements across our work systems. The approach is driving engagement, ownership and learning.
All accidents cannot be prevented by changing people’s behaviour through enforcing procedures, as all humans are prone to making mistakes in efforts to get work done. Telling people what to do is not the answer. What we can do for our workers who enable safety of frontline work is equip them with the competencies that can help make work safer in the environments we operate in. In 2019, we have developed a new competency management framework.
Furthermore, we conducted a series of critical risk reviews involving frontline workers in 2019, which resulted in the identification of the top five to seven critical risks of causing fatal and severe injuries across our operational contexts. These include: cargo fires, warehousing operations, dropped objects, mooring operations, man over board and working at height. Tangible, practical critical controls are being implemented to prevent and mitigate consequences, and a framework for the harmonisation of critical
risk management across the business is being developed. This work will guide the prioritisation of safety improvement and ensure we continue to build capacity to address our highest risks with effective control strategies.
“Safety is about people, not injury numbers. For us to be successful in our ambition of Maersk being a safe place to work, we need to understand the conditions and environment which our frontline people work in on a daily basis. Engaging with our frontline colleagues helps us to build trust and gain the insight we need
to learn and improve their work.”

Reducing food loss
 Better cold chains equal less food loss
Global cold chains
are so fragmented
that companies often experience frustrating inefficiencies in the movement of their frozen or refrigerated goods. Many handovers and little transparency can ultimately lead to waste of time and loss of some of the goods.
Maersk transports one in four refrigerated containers globally,
and we are building an integrated cold chain logistics offering that can close major gaps in the supply chain, reducing cost and waste. We are investing in cold storage facilities in emerging markets, the latest example located in
St. Petersburg in Russia.
We are also developing and offering digital innovations and reefer technology that enable increased transparency for customers. One digital element in our offering is Remote Container Management (RCM) that creates end-to-end visibility of the conditions inside the box. Since the launch in 2017, more than 3,600 companies have signed up for RCM technology and 94% of Maersk’s more than 380,000 refrigerated containers are supported by the technology.
Why is it important?
Ambitions
Targets 2019 and 2020
Progress in 2019
The global food system must adapt to support a global population of 10 billion while global warming stays below 1.5 degrees. Reducing food loss and waste is key to this change.
We transport about 25% of the world’s food
To leverage our services, products and capabilities in order to contribute to halving food loss in logistics in support of sustainable development and at the same time enhance our cold chain business.
Establish two global partnerships to address loss points in the food supply chain.
Investing in unbroken cold chain offerings is an important growth opportunity for our business. At sea, we already carry 27% of the world’s refrigerated containers and 25% of the world’s food commodities. As our cold chain business grows, we can leverage our services, products and capabilities to contribute to halving food loss during transportation, in support of a more sustainable global food system and local economic development.
We have established a partnership with the World Resources Institute (WRI) in pursuit of our ambition to reduce food loss in logistics.
In 2019, this collaboration worked to develop metrics for measuring food loss, and in 2020 we will assess how we may use these metrics to inform our work.
As part of our partnership with WRI, three pilot projects were carried out to quantify the amount and causes of food losses that occur during handling and storage between the farm and the freighter. This includes losses due to
commodities, and targeted efforts in our activities may help to reduce food loss. At the same time, it is a clear business priority to grow our cold chain business.
Develop a metrics framework for food loss contribution and to guide the shared value of our business-related investments.
damage by pests, sun exposure, rough handling, and prolonged transit time. The pilots are set
to identify possible solutions to reduce those losses. Candidates include improved handling processes, introduction of cold storage technologies and better logistics management. Scheduled for completion in 2020, the pilots follow citrus fruits in South Africa, avocados in Kenya, and grapes in Peru.
In addition, we engaged with other stakeholders in this field such as the World Economic Forum’s Food Loss team and the Danish food loss and waste think tank ‘One Third’. From these and other engagements it is clear to us that a uniform approach to prevent food loss is not very likely. Rather, we will need to foster a range of intervention options fitting different commodities and regulatory frameworks.

We want to radically change the global
ship recycling industry to be dominated by responsible practices for the benefit of workers and the environment, as well as responsible yards and shipowners.
Continue to invest and work with selected yards in Alang.
Develop the wider Alang area.
We remain committed to our ship recycling programme and work with selected yards in Alang, India. Since 2016, we have recycled vessels at six different yards in Alang, requiring yard owners to improve conditions at the yard to comply with our Responsible Ship Recycling Standard which goes beyond the Hong Kong Convention. To enable these investments, we accept a lower price per ton of steel for our vessels. We have documented that this has led to improved conditions for the workers at these yards, and in the wider Alang area in which we also invest. We have also seen a push to improve conditions at other yards.
We have by no means fulfilled our ambition yet, but we are proud of the progress made and development of better working conditions for thousands of people in Alang, India.
In 2019, we sent four new vessels for recycling using four different yards. When we recycle
in India, we continue to see performance comparable to when we recycle in Turkey and China, as documented in third party audits. The recycling operations commence only after RSRS compliance is verified. At a new yard, this process typically takes around 2 months from the vessel landing.
In July 2019 auditors raised a previously unknown legal requirement for fire safety certificates, which the yards did not have. This brought total findings to two. By December,
all yards had completed third party fire safety compliance verification audits and the finding was closed. What remains is a finding on excess overtime.
documented criticism of the environmental, health and safety conditions. As a leader in the shipping industry, we can make a real impact in driving responsible practices.
Actively support and participate in the development of the Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative.
The vessels recycled in Alang in 2019 were reflagged in early 2018, following the acquisition of Hamburg Sud and merging of fleets. We make decisions on flagging with a global perspective and on a case-by-case basis, considering level of support provided by the flag nation, cabotage needs, tax legislation, as well as commercial and operational optimisation opportunities.
A critical point for the Alang yards’ continued interest in investing in sustainability is the prospect of being included in the EU’s list of approved ship recycling facilities. This is updated every six months and several yards are in process for approval.
We continue as active members of the Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative (SRTI), which seeks to accelerate a voluntary market-
driven approach to responsible ship recycling practices, with shipowners sharing information on ship recycling approaches.
Improving health in wider Alang
We continue our work to improve access to healthcare in the wider Alang area. In 2019:
• 29,000 people received free general health
care from the mobile health unit (MHU) supported by us and in partnership with the Indian Red Cross since May 2018.
• more than 2,900 people have benefited from the laboratory tests, X-Rays, ECGs within
the MHU.
• more than 5,000 workers in Alang took part in training on personal hygiene, sanitation, substance abuse and sexually transmitted diseases. The project is a partnership with the Bhavnagar Blood Bank since May 2019.

2019:
Ensure compliance with Third-Party Code of Conduct.
Sharpen the focus on risk management through ‘risk score’ methodology.
Align supplier due diligence processes across segments in a consistent manner.
Our responsible procurement programme works with direct Maersk suppliers. We engage with approximately 3,000 high-risk suppliers through due diligence activities such as audits, self-assessments, documentation reviews, and improvement plans. This is out of a group of 16,000 suppliers with whom we have a contract, and a total supplier population of about 60,000.
We use a risk-based approach working with suppliers in 15 high-risk categories. These
are: Trucking and Intermodal, warehousing services, facility management, outsourced labour, terminals, shipbuilding yards and drydocks, security offshore, promotional items, customs agents, security onshore, construction, chemicals and paints, equipment, maintenance and repair, container manufacturers and manning (seafarers).
We published an updated version of our
Third Party Code of Conduct, renamed as Supplier Code of Conduct, with guidelines for implementing the provisions of the Code in early 2020. The new Code addresses evolving topics such as data security and privacy, and
is more aligned with our supplier relationships and our new Maersk employee Code of Conduct.

2020:
Ensure compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct.
Review responsible procurement programme to align with evolving risk picture from expansion of activities on land.
Participate in collaborative efforts focused on trucking.
In 2019, 810 suppliers in high-risk categories went through audits and assessments. Results of these activities are shown in the graph to the right. The number of audits increased
in 2019 due to a review of marine services providers in ports in Africa (see p. 26). The number of self-assessments decreased as fewer new suppliers were onboarded in high- risk categories. In total, 130 suppliers were put through an improvement plan process to meet our standards. We did not terminate any relationships as a result of non-compliance.
Other priorities for 2019 included integrating activities on land into our existing supplier assessment system, where we particularly focused on enhancing our impact on the trucking category by involving colleagues on the ground in supplier assessment follow-up, and engaging in the European collaborative platform Responsible Trucking. Read more on page 26.
We improved on our processes by implementing a new risk scoring system into the supplier assessment process, and by preparing automated monitoring of whether all the necessary clauses are in our contracts with suppliers. Roll-out of the latter including due diligence processes took place in January 2020, while the risk scoring system will be explored further in years to come.

Riskofcorruptioninouroceanbusinessisfound primarily in our interactions with authorities
in ports and at border controls, and mostly as facilitation payments, and in our terminals in government agreements on concessions. Risk in our supply chain is managed mainly through our Responsible Procurement programme.
We work to combat bribery, fraud, kickbacks and preferential treatment, by performing due diligence of agents, joint venture partners, key suppliers, and M&A targets prior to signing a contract or entering a new market. Expectations to all employees are outlined in the Maersk Code of Conduct. We enforce rules on travel, meals, lodging and entertainment, and employees complete training on compliance.
Our programme for 2019–2022 is based on guidelines for complying with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In 2019, we focused on:

Ambassadors for compliance
A strong compliance culture is paramount to our global reputation and being a good place to work.
To that end, we established a global Business Compliance Ambassadors network in 2019. These ambassadors will serve as advisors
for compliance-related questions, particularly on anti-corruption, foreign trade controls and competition law. The network is sponsored
by our CEO and helps to integrate compliance into business operations. The ambassadors are a vital link in expanding the global compliance footprint at a local level.
The 61 business compliance ambassadors have been appointed for a period of 2–3 years, to cover over 70 countries with high corruption and other compliance risks. The ambassadors will perform their new role in addition to their core job responsibilities.

Human rights are a precondition for freedom and dignity for people, for rule of law and for inclusive and sustainable growth on which we depend as a business. Respect for human rights is rooted in our values and key to our license to operate from employees, customers, investors, communities, governments and other stakeholders.
Ensure that we prevent and address adverse human rights impacts associated with our business activities.
2019:
Anchor human rights due diligence in the company’s overall governance system.
Continue to close identified gaps in relation to standards for employees in our company and in the supply chain.
Conduct further analysis of human rights risks related to the digitisation of our business.
Three actions were taken in 2019 in relation to our human rights ambition.
Our commitment to human rights due diligence was incorporated into our new Maersk Code of Conduct. Moreover, we developed a reference tool for inclusion of sustainability topics, including human rights, in decisions related to investments or acquisitions of companies.
With these new codes and tools, we are better prepared to monitor progress and performance up against international standards.
Furthermore, we continued to assess potential ethical aspects of our use of new technologies. We held an internal seminar on ethics in artificial intelligence, and continued to test the relevance of emerging external guidance, including the EU’s ‘Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence’.
Regulation of corporate human rights is on the rise, including reporting and mandatory due diligence requirements. We support effective and balanced regulation that promotes a global level playing field for responsible business.
2020:
Continue to embed human rights into company-wide governance and compliance systems.
We also engage in activities to further human rights in the shipping industry. In 2019, jointly with the Institute for Business and Human Rights, the RAFTO Foundation and the Danish Institute for Human Rights and Anglo American, Maersk co-hosted two roundtables on human rights in the shipping industry. The roundtables led to the publication of the report ‘Navigating Human Rights – a guide to human rights in the shipping industry’.
Maersk also contributed to a new human rights guide by Danish Shipping, with guidance and tools for how to conduct human rights diligence.

 New technologies require good communication
In California, air quality regulations require all port container handling equipment to be zero or near zero emissions by the year 2030. In
Los Angeles, we are modernising our port equipment and creating new, on the job training programmes for diesel mechanics to become electrical mechanics.
Maersk is participating with the Pacific Maritime Association (the US
West Coast employers’ organisation) to establish a training center
set to open in 2020. Collaborating with the dockworkers’ union, the goal is to create a training programme for diesel mechanics to “upskill”,
so they can maintain and repair the new equipment. Additionally, the parties strive to “re-skill” existing dockworkers to perform basic mechanic functions maintaining chassis
and other conventional equipment.
This endeavour complements Maersk’s 2018 guidelines on new technologies in the workplace, which obligate us to have an open and proactive dialogue with employees and their representative bodies and to support employees whose jobs are impacted by technology and modernisation efforts.

for our employee relations work in 2019 was
to strengthen management guidance on interactions with unions and work councils. The goal is to ensure that we have a culture and processes in place for dialogue with employee representatives that support positive pathways to change.
As part of these efforts, we introduced e-learning modules on employee relations which was party completed online and

reported. We found that the complaint and grievances procedure is clearly documented, and it was confirmed that including bullying and harassment as a complaint category in 2020 will contribute to increased awareness of on-board conduct.
We appointed regional employee relations leads in Europe, Africa & Middle East, Asia-Pacific, North America, and Latin America. One of their future tasks is to describe the employee relations maturity level for their region, based on which we will create a heatmap to guide our work.
In 2019, our whistleblower system received
141 cases related to potential violations of our Commit Rule on Employee Relations. When cases are reported to our whistleblower system, they are first screened to determine if they fall within the scope of the system. If this is the case, an investigation is commenced to determine
if evidence can be provided and if so, if the complaint can be substantiated. If a complaint is substantiated, corrective action is taken. 19 of the 141 cases have so far been substantiated while 68 are still undergoing assessment.

Progress in 2019
It is a basic obligation and a core element of our values not to discriminate against our employees. Discrimination bars people from living up to their full potential, creates
We aspire to create an inclusive culture where all employees can contribute to their fullest. In doing this, we will be in a prime position
to attract people from the widest talent
pool, specifically increasing the gender and nationality diversity at our senior levels.
Board of Directors: target for 2023
Three women on the Board of Directors, if the Board consists of less than twelve members, and four women, if the Board consists of twelve or more members.
At the end of 2019, there were two women on the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Board of Directors 19. This means our target was not met. At the time of the search for new Board candidates it was not possible to match the competences needed with the available female candidates. The target has been extended to 2023, but we will continuously assess whether it is still ambitious.

Women Men
We focus on driving progress on our other targets. We continued to drive our recruitment targets through our external branding and recruitment practices and through a strong focus on measuring gender in our talent management processes. We made progress towards our maternity return rate target of 90%, moving from 73% in 2018 to 74% in 2019.
Our key approach to enhancing diversity and inclusion is employee engagement and capability building. In 2019, we:

inequality as well as less stable and prosperous societies. We also want to leverage the competitive advantage that diverse teams and inclusive cultures can bring to our business.
Senior management
Target for senior management representation of 1) women and 2) persons from countries that are not in the OECD high-income countries list (see graphic on the right).
• Launched a new e-learning, ‘Beating Bias’
on understanding inclusion and mitigating unconscious bias. 56% of our onshore operations completed the e-learning globally.
• Conducted leadership training including embedding diversity and inclusion in the new ‘Leading Maersk’ with 1,188 first-time leaders in Maersk globally completing the training.
• Continued to focus on increasing gender diversity with over 390 women participating in our flagship Strategies for Success programme in 14 global workshops.
• Made on-line sexual harassment awareness training and support guides available to all employees via our global intranet in support of our policy of zero tolerance.
• Continued our work on LGBT inclusion with Maersk participation in five pride parades on three continents, backed by four internal webinars available to employees globally.
Externally, our work was recognised as Maersk was included in the Bloomberg gender equality index for 2019.
The Maersk gender diversity and inclusion policy was revised in 2019. The policy provides details of our targets and actions to increase gender diversity and is available on the Maersk website 20.
       19 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S has a number of subsidiary companies that fall under the Danish legislative requirements on gender reporting, and which have all set targets for the underrepresented gender on the respective Boards of Directors. Of the companies, a portion have already obtained target representation on the Board, while the remaining continue to strive for their targets. See the management reports of the respective companies.

Responsible tax
Well-functioning tax systems locally and internationally help finance education, infrastructure and other public services that support sustainable development, local societies, business and trade. We recognise the need for companies to support the local economies in which they do business.
Be a compliant and accountable taxpayer with responsible and transparent tax practices.
Ensure full compliance with tax regulations in all countries where we operate.
Continue to engage in dialogue with stakeholders on tax matters.
Implement the B Team Responsible Tax Principles with reporting for 2020 (The B Team is a non-profit initiative aiming to catalyse more sustainable business practices).
Our total tax charge in 2019 was 458 million USD, compared to 644 million in 2018. This drop occurs because we divested our activities in the energy sector.
In line with our target on continued dialogue, we participated in The Tax Dialogues organised by Oxfam IBIS, the B Team’s responsible tax project, the ICC international Chamber of Commerce Taxation Commission, and the UN Committee of Tax Experts (observer status).
We operate in countries that the EU or other tax authorities list as noncooperative. This is part of our global presence. On the EU list for 2019 are eight countries, of which we have activities in two: Oman, where we pay USD 2.0 million in taxes on a profit of USD 12.6 million, and in Trinidad and Tobago, where we have only very minor profits on which we pay 30% in tax.
We are preparing to report in line with the B Team Responsible Tax Principles, which in addition to our current practices will include reporting online on our use of tax incentives and taxes paid at country level.

Targets 2019 and 2020
Progress in 2019
Emergency logistics services are critical when natural or human- incurred disaster strikes. Lives can be saved if aid reaches the impacted areas more quickly and efficiently. Our deep insight into logistics and global presence can help achieve this, and we see it as a clear responsibility to do so.
To follow our values and use our leverage and logistics capabilities to support response efforts in case of natural disasters and
other emergencies.
Participate, as part of the Logistics Emergency Team (LET), in filling operational gaps in case of complex emergencies and large-scale natural disasters.
Contribute in LET preparedness activities such as training and knowledge sharing on transport and logistics capacity as well as site access at selected locations.
In case of complex humanitarian crises and/ or natural disasters, The Logistics Emergency Team (LET) is activated to help provide emergency response. Established in 2005, LET has four corporate members: Maersk, UPS, Agility and DP World, and supports the Global Logistics Cluster, led by the United Nations World Food Programme.
In 2019, we were part of disaster response efforts in Mozambique and the Bahamas, supporting the Global Logistics Cluster as well as coordinating response efforts with other LET partners.
In Mozambique, following Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, LET partners initially provided up-to-date insight on infrastructure capacity and availability. Next, pro bono storage solutions were provided, including reefers (refrigerated containers), as well as pro bono air and ocean cargo lifts.
To alleviate the effects of Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, LET partners supported the humanitarian response operation. To address the shortage of warehousing, Maersk released
40 containers as a local pro bono donation to assist in
the distribution of aid and transit storage serving relief organisations. During a period of two months, a Maersk
20’ container was used to distribute freshwater for local communities.

Operational scope.
Data from other sources than the financial and operational scoped data. Since 2017 gender and nationality data is reported by headcount, previously by FTE.
Scope is limited to shipping operations and includes Hamburg Süd data from 2017. In 2019, we changed the indicator underlying our relative CO2 reduction target. Relative CO2 reduction is now measured using EEOI (Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator) as defined by IMO in MEPC.1/Circ.684 and calculated as g CO2/(Ton x Nm).

Comments on 2019 performance data
Social performance
Our employees
FTE data is taken from the audited 2019 Annual Report of A.P. Moller - Maersk.
The increase in diversity on both gender and target nationalities, both at leadership level and across A.P. Moller - Maersk,
is due to having a higher retention rate of women and target nationality groups.
Further comments on our performance on diversity and inclusion, along with our targets and performance on representation of women on the Board of Directors and representation of women and persons from countries that are not in the OECD high-income countries list, can be found on p. 38.
LTIf has decreased due to a drop in the number of LTI cases particularly in our terminals and freight forwarding operations. More details about our safety performance can be found on pages 30–31.
Environmental performance
Energy consumption
Decrease in fuel oil consumption in 2019 is mainly due to reduction in the sailing distance of vessels as well as a decrease in time chartered vessels.
Decrease in gas fuel consumption is due to several factors including closure of factories and office locations.
Increase in other fuels consumption mainly due to increase in terminals.
Consumption of carbon-neutral biofuels for shipping service launched in 2019.
Decrease is mainly due to closure of factories and decrease in office space occupancy.
Decrease in total energy consumption (total, TJ) is due to the decrease in fuel oil consumption.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
Decrease in GHG emissions is due to the decrease in energy consumption.
97% of our scope 1 emissions come from the operations of our fleet. Decrease in direct GHG emissions is due to the decrease in fuel oil consumption.
Decrease in indirect GHG emissions is partly due to decrease in electricity consumption.
Improvement in operational energy efficiency has been achieved by technical retrofitting and by improving planning and optimising of networks.
Other air emissions
SOx is produced from the combustion of heavy fuel oil. Decrease in SOx emissions is due to decreases in fuel oil consumption.
NOx is produced from the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen gases in the air during combustion of fuels. Decrease in NOx emissions is due to decreases in fuel oil consumption.
Other resource consumption
Decrease is due to a change in the categorisation of hazardous waste, as well as closure of factories and decrease in office space occupancy.
Decrease is partly due to closure of factories and decrease in office space occupancy.
Spills (hydrocarbon)
No uncontained spills above the threshold of >10 m3.
Economic performance
Financial data is taken from the audited 2019 Annual Report of A.P. Moller - Maersk.

Independent assurance report
To the stakeholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S
A. P. Møller - Mærsk A/S engaged us to provide limited assurance on the data and information described below and set out in the Sustainability Report of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S for the period January 1 – 31 December 2019.
Our conclusion
Based on the procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained, nothing came to our attention that causes us not to believe that data and information in the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report are free of material misstatements and prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with
the accounting principles as stated at https://www.maersk.com/about/ sustainability/reports.
This conclusion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of our report.
What we are assuring
The scope of our work was limited to assurance over data and information in the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report for the period 1 January – 31 December 2019.
Professional standards applied and level of assurance
We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised)
‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical
Financial Information’. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less
in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.
Our independence and quality control
We have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which includes independence and other ethical requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our work was carried out by an independent multidisciplinary team with experience in sustainability reporting and assurance.
Understanding reporting and measurement methodologies
Data and information need to be read and understood together with the accounting principles https://www.maersk.com/about/sustainability/reports, which Management are solely responsible for selecting and applying. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.
Work performed
We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the data and information. In doing so and based on our professional judgement, we:
• Conducted interviews with management at corporate and Brand level
responsible for the sustainability strategy, management and reporting;
• Performed an assessment of materiality and the selection of topics for the
Sustainability Report and comparison to the results of a media search;
• Read and evaluated reporting guidelines and internal control procedures
at corporate level and reporting entity level regarding the data to be
consolidated in the 2019 Sustainability Report;
• Conducted analytical review of the data and trend explanations submitted by all
reporting entities to A.P. Moller - Maersk Accounting & Controlling for consolidation; • Evaluated evidence.
Management’s responsibilities
Management of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S is responsible for:
• Designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information
relevant to the preparation of data and information in the Sustainability Report
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
• Establishing objective accounting principles for preparing data and information; • Measuring and reporting data and information in the Sustainability Report
based on the accounting principles; and
• The content of Sustainability Report for the period 1 January – 31 December 2019.
Our responsibility

• Planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about
whether data and information for the period 1 January – 31 December 2019 are free from material misstatements and are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting principles;
• Forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained; and
• Reporting our conclusion to the stakeholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S.

 PORTFOLIO NOTE
The future A.P. Moller - Maersk will be an integrated and focused shipping, ports and logistics company. Oil
and oil-related businesses are to
be separated. This has resulted in portfolio changes in 2018.
Maersk Oil is not part of sustainability reporting for 2018. Maersk Drilling and Maersk Supply Service continue to be classified as discontinued operations and are included in this report with data presented on aggregate level.
Sustainability data for Hamburg Süd is included for 2018.

Foreword by the CEO
Dear reader,
This is A.P. Moller - Maersk’s 10th annual report on our company’s sustainability strategy and performance. During the past decade, A.P. Moller - Maersk has changed in line with our global context. Over the last two years, A.P. Moller - Maersk has moved from being a conglomerate with activities in a broad range of industries, towards becoming one integrated company focusing on end-to-end services in container logistics, simplifying and connecting our customers’ supply chains.
In 2018, we reached several key milestones on our strategic journey. In line with our intent to exit the oil and oil-related businesses, in Q1 we closed the sale of Maersk Oil to Total, and in Q3 we announced our intention to pursue a separate listing of Maersk Drilling in 2019.
In September, we announced
the integration of the commercial organisation of Maersk Line with Damco which is going to market under the Maersk brand as of January 2019. We have successfully progressed on integrating Hamburg Süd, completing the integration of operations and realising synergies above expectations. We have also seen the appointment of a new Executive Board.
We have made progress in the move towards digitising our business and the way we serve our customers. Already, we see that 98% of our bookings and 89% of our quotes, respectively, are online. For quotes, this was achieved within just one year and the number is still growing. We continue to develop our blockchain documentation solution, TradeLens, to improve our customer experience and create access to trade, as digitising information can drive down the cost of trade, reduce the occurrence of corruption and support job creation.
Zero emissions by 2050
On the global sustainability agenda,
the dominant changes over the past ten years have been the establishment of the United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals and the growing urgency to tackle climate change. With the latest scientific assessments, there is no doubt that the world in general needs to embark on an all-encompassing transformation process away from the reliance on fossil fuels. This goes for shipping as well, and we have taken steps to respond to this need.
In 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk established the most ambitious goal for reducing CO2 emissions within our industry. We have begun a journey towards having net-zero CO2 emissions from our own operations by 2050. This is an important ambition and one we can only deliver on in collaboration with many other stakeholders by innovating and developing the technologies needed to reach the target.
New approach to safety
In 2018 we have also taken significant steps to renew and step up our approach to safety in A.P. Moller - Maersk. While the last decade brought improvements in safety performance, we have reached a plateau at which we have not been able to eliminate the high-potential accidents, including the number of fatalities occurring as part of our operations. In 2018, we experienced seven fatalities, and my Executive Board colleagues and I are deeply distressed by this.
We know that accidents are never intentional, they occur as a result of
a number of factors coinciding, and there is rarely a correlation between
the efforts made to prevent minor events and injuries and high-potential accidents or events. In the future, we will increase our focus on building the organisational capacity and operational controls that will act as barriers to accidents being escalated to life- changing or fatal outcomes. We have established a corporate safety function and new levels of both leadership and employee engagement in safety. I will be at the forefront of these efforts, consistently communicating on the right and obligation to stop unsafe work
and the importance of being prepared for the unexpected.
Global trade will change
We publish this report at a time where tensions over global trade are stronger than what we have seen for many
years. So far, global trade has not been severely diminished by these tensions, even though we remain alert to different trends in the years to come. Our 100- year history has taught us that trade
is nothing if not resilient. When the benefits of global trade are questioned, as they are now, the result is that trade changes. A positive outcome will depend on an orderly process to alter the global rule book on trade. It must reflect the need for greater balance, inclusivity
and sustainability in trade, and
A.P. Moller - Maersk is putting our leverage and insights to work in that direction. We are committed and
taking action to assist more people around the world in trading, through empowering small businesses, by reducing complexities and advocating the reduction of indirect trade costs.
Continuously committed
In 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk contributed to The Ocean Cleanup project which is addressing the issue of ocean plastic pollution. I am pleased to see our company being part of the efforts to solve this significant issue, and it is clear to me that our small part in this project is a source of pride for many A.P. Moller - Maersk employees.
To me, it demonstrates the importance of contributing when and where we can make a difference. We will continue to do so, by running our business with high integrity, supported by our values and policies, and our continued commitment to the UN Global Compact principles.
Søren Skou
CEO of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S
OUR COMMITMENTS
A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed to operating in congruence with the UN Global Compact’s ten principles on responsible business conduct.
We support and commit to contribute positively to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, while also reducing our potential negative impact on the goals.
A.P. Moller - Maersk has been recognised as Global Compact LEAD for demonstrating its ongoing commitment
to the UN Global Compact and its Ten Principles. In 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk has shown its commitment
by participating in Action Platforms on Reporting on the SDGs, Pathways to Low-Carbon & Resilient Development, Decent Work in Global Supply Chains and Sustainable Ocean Business, and has submitted an Advanced Communication on Progress, available at www.unglobalcompact.org/ what-is-gc/participants/44.

 06 STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE
Our sustainability strategy and governance
The A.P. Moller - Maersk sustainability strategy is designed to support our business strategy and contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We work in partnerships to fulfil our ambitions.
Over the past two years,
A.P. Moller - Maersk has been on
a journey of change, reshaping from
a shipping and energy conglomerate into a focused transport and logistics company. Our ambition is to become the global integrator of container logistics, providing our customers with end-to-end services for a simplified and connected supply chain.
Our sustainability strategy was reviewed and updated in 2017 with this ambition in mind. It is made up of four shared value programmes for our integrated container logistics business and is based on responsible business practices on all material issues (see graphic on next page).
We see the four shared value areas as the major issues where we can use our business to develop large-scale
solutions that can alleviate some of the world’s major sustainability challenges while at the same time supporting
the development of our business. For example, the goal of decarbonising container logistics will support our business in living up to the demands of our customers for low-carbon transportation, as well as meeting the need for cost- efficient energy and helping us prepare for new legislative measures, such as a tax on carbon emissions. At the same time, we will be one of the companies driving progress towards carbon-neutral options in the transportation sector, which is essential for tackling climate change.
Fulfilling the new role of business
With the launch of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
the world set itself a global and shared framework with a common direction and a vocabulary to discuss and invent solutions and transformational actions towards 2030.
The SDGs also defined a new and enhanced space for business to contribute to solving major global challenges.
Looking across the SDGs and underlying targets, the business of
A.P. Moller - Maersk touches, directly or indirectly, on all 17 goals. However, for five of the goals we have the ability to contribute to transformations at scale and we can match these goals with our sustainability strategy’s shared value programmes (see graphic below).
For example, trade is central to eliminating poverty, creating decent jobs and assisting inclusive industrialisation
PARTNERSHIPS
       HOW A.P. MOLLER - MAERSK CONNECTS TO THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
Strong potential for positive impact at scale
Through our business, where we can have the greatest positive impact on a systemic level.
Potential direct / indirect positive impact
Where our business has or may potentially have a direct or indirect positive impact through our activities and business practices.
Responsibility to mitigate potential negative impact
Through our commitment to the UN Global Compact, where our business has a responsibility to mitigate potential negative impacts on people, society and/or the environment.
Relevant sub-targets for each Goal are listed under the SDG icons in the report chapters for each material issue.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A.P. Moller - Maersk

   and innovation. It is directly and indirectly referenced throughout the sub-targets defined for each SDG. Our business operates at the heart of global trade, and we can leverage our voice and our reach to support action towards achieving these targets – on the ground and in public fora.
The SDGs also comprise other areas where we can have a positive impact, but mostly locally or at a smaller scale, and areas where we have a responsibility to mitigate potential negative impact
from our business. These are areas that are addressed through our corporate programmes on safety, environment, human rights, labour, diversity, responsible tax and anti-corruption etc.
The need for partnerships
While businesses strive to take on their part in reaching the SDGs before 2030, the need for broader collaboration only increases. A pressing example of this is our ambition to decarbonise container logistics by 2050. This is a huge task
and we believe we will find better solutions faster by building alliances with competitors, customers, suppliers, knowledge institutions, other industries and the public sector.
We will continue in the
A.P. Moller - Maersk tradition of working in partnerships to affect systemic change and clear the path for transformation. An overview of some of the partnerships we are involved in can be seen in the sidebar on page six.
Sustainability Report 2018
 
 08 STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE
  MATERIALITY 2018
Our materiality model assesses and groups sustainability issues in terms of whether they constitute a risk, responsibility or a shared value opportunity for
A.P. Moller - Maersk. Materiality is an important contributor to our strategy development and review processes. Our overall thinking on what materiality means continues to evolve. For example, our work on sustainability risk management and investor engagement, particularly in the context of the recommendations from the Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), (read more on page 15), has prompted us to reconsider some of the strategic and financial risks relative to our material issues.
We have not performed a full materiality update in 2018, but have made three changes compared to 2017 in the risk and responsibility categories:
RESPONSIBILITY
Where do we have a responsibility to mitigate significant potential negative impact on people, society or the environment?
Issues:
Injuries and fatalities
Labour rights
Diversity and inclusion
Tax practices and transparency Human rights
Disaster response
Ocean health
New issue in 2018 is highlighted in blue and rescoped issues in grey.
• The issue of land acquisition and resettlement by linked third parties has become less material following changes in business strategy, resulting in fewer or no green field investments, and has therefore been taken out.
• The issue of physical impacts of climate change has been added as an assumed long-term financial risk following the results of research done this year in the area of climate risks.
• In a human rights impact assessment we performed internally in 2015, labour rights in indirect hiring and subcontracted workers, transport and other services to/from conflict areas and armed services were identified as lacking in governance and mitigation. We have resolved these management gaps, and are replacing the three issues with the broader issues of human rights and labour rights.
RISK
Where do sustainability issues pose a significant financial or reputational risk to our business?
Issues:
Major accident/oil spill/chemical spill
Major non-compliance with corruption regulations
Supplier non-compliance with
A.P. Moller - Maersk Third-Party Code of Conduct
Uneven playing field in the enforcement of global SOx regulations
Physical impacts of climate change
 THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF MATERIALITY
SHARED VALUE
Where can we, through our business, pursue and scale solutions to meet significant systemic challenges for the benefit of society and, at the same time, create opportunities for our business?
Issues:
Disposal of vessels and rigs for recycling Decarbonising logistics
Multiplying the benefits of trade
Food loss

  INTRODUCTION STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE
TRANSFORMATION AND OUR BUSINESS PROGRESS, ACTIONS AND AMBITIONS PROGRESS OVERVIEW DATA AND ASSURANCE 09
Governance reflects strategy
In 2018, a new governance approach was developed and will continue to evolve, as our business transformation progresses further. The overall governance responsibility for sustainability now resides directly with the Executive Board rather than a separate Sustainability Council, as was the case in the conglomerate structure. The company’s sustainability function brings proposals for new programmes or positions to the Executive Board for approval as and
POLICIES GOVERNING OUR ACTIONS
when relevant. An annual progress report is compiled for the Executive Board to support oversight on strategic priorities, trends and key issues. The Board of Directors receives sustainability strategy updates, and also reviews and approves the annual Sustainability Report.
Each of our sustainability strategy’s four shared value programmes are guided by a task force with executive level sponsorship and management- level representatives from both line of business and sustainability. Each
task force is chaired and served by the sustainability department helping to drive and facilitate projects and collaborations.
Governance on responsible business practices resides with line management which has, in line with our change towards becoming one company, taken on greater responsibility for issues management and risk mitigation.
 Our work is guided by internal policies based on our Core Values, external standards and commitments. Key international standards and references are listed below.

Sustainability Report 2018
 The business world is increasingly called upon to use its powers of change and implementation to help solve major societal challenges. A.P. Moller - Maersk focuses on where we have the greatest leverage and potential impact on issues that are material to us.
  10 TRANSFORMATION AND OUR BUSINESS
Transformation and our business
Our sustainability strategy calls out four areas where A.P. Moller - Maersk through our business can pursue solutions and call for others to act. These efforts may result in significant system changes and respond to challenges faced by
the global society, and at the same time create opportunities for our business.
The four areas are climate change, inclusive trade, food loss and ship recycling, and we report on progress and developments in all of these, while also explaining how we understand
and approach these issues with a view to transformation.
The issues of climate change and inclusive trade are given special attention in this
year’s report. They are issues that will be fundamentally transformative to how we operate. How they develop will impact business strategy, performance and market conditions globally – for us as well as our supplier and customer base.
A.P. Moller - Maersk

 12 TRANSFORMATION AND OUR BUSINESS | CLIMATE CHANGE
Towards a breakthrough in climate change
Climate change is one of the world’s most pressing challenges. An effective response will make a difference to how the next decades play out and how the next generations are able to live.
The 2018 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) incontrovertibly states that the effects of climate change cannot fully be prevented,
and today the average global rise in temperatures is already 1.0 degree. The report also clearly states that to keep climate change at manageable levels, we need to create a carbon-neutral economy by around 2050.1
This includes what has been termed ‘hard-to-abate’ sectors, of which shipping is one due to its long asset cycles.
A.P. Moller - Maersk is determined to put its resources, relationships and leverage towards abandoning fossil fuels.
Very ambitious targets
In 2018, the Executive Board of
A.P. Moller - Maersk approved a new company ambition for climate change: to have net-zero CO2 emissions from our own operations by 2050.2 We do not by net-zero refer to off-setting CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. By committing to this target, we believe we will drive the transformation of the shipping industry towards use of carbon-neutral fuels.
Based on our experience, we know that efficiency can only keep shipping emissions stable, not reduce or eliminate them. Nevertheless, until decarbonisation is achieved, decoupling

business growth from emissions is a necessity, and we have set an efficiency target of 60% relative reduction in CO2 by 2030 from a 2008 baseline.
With these targets, we are breaking the mould for climate targets and ambitions in the shipping industry.
A decade of learning
A.P. Moller - Maersk has for ten years pursued ways to reduce our relative CO2 emissions, and had set a target of 60% relative reductions by 2020, using a 2007 baseline.
By the end of 2018, our reductions had reached 47% since 2007. This is not enough to reach 60% in two years’ time.

Our target is net-zero CO2 emissions, because using e.g. biofuels will emit CO2 when burned on a vessel. However, if the feedstock used to produce the biofuel absorbs
CO2 equal to the emissions produced when burned (and the production process of the fuel is also CO2-neutral) then specific biofuels can be CO2 neutral.
The 2050 scenario is based on a simulation, which builds on our expectations for the development of our business activities until 2050 and the reductions coming from exchanging old vessels with zero carbon vessels. It does not however, include post 2030 reductions coming from further reductions on the remaining part of the old fleet.

TRANSFORMATION AND OUR BUSINESS
PROGRESS, ACTIONS AND AMBITIONS
PROGRESS OVERVIEW
DATA AND ASSURANCE 13
We knew our 2020 target was a stretched target, and we are convinced that aiming high has pushed us to do more than we would have without setting the bar high.
Our efficiency work to date has allowed us to decouple our emissions from trade growth. We are now changing our efficiency target to align both target year and baseline with the IMO strategy for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions in shipping, aiming for a 60% reduction relative to cargo moved by 2030, compared to a 2008 baseline. This means that we will be able to sustain decoupled CO2 emissions from our growth, and as a company we are proud to already be aligned with the IMO industry target.
We have reached that mark by optimising efficiency across our fleet, with technical retrofittings including capacity boost, new bulbous bows, new propellers and engine modifications, and by improving planning and optimising networks. Over the last four years alone, we have invested USD 1 billion and engaged 50+ engineers each year in developing and deploying energy efficiency solutions. We expect this investment level to be sustained in pursuit of our new targets.
Efficiency gains do not, however, solve the climate change problem. That can only be achieved through decarbonisation.
Collaboration towards breakthrough
Decarbonisation changes the game completely. Massive innovative solutions and fuel transformation must take place in the next 5-10 years.
It is important to understand just how great a challenge this is. Transforming the shipping industry which has run on relatively cheap, heavy fuel for 100 years is not only about how ships must be designed in the future and what type of engines will power them – safely – on what type of fuel. It is also about building entire new supply chains for these
new solutions. All of this breakthrough innovation will have to take place in
the 2020s and is more than any single company can do. We are committed to being a leading actor in this process, but we call on everyone to engage and invest in creating the needed innovation.
Research and development will be the cornerstone in decarbonising the shipping industry, and we urge all parties

 As part of the work on our new climate change targets, we established a baseline overview of CO2 emissions
for our full value chain. This analysis showed that 65% of our greenhouse gas emissions come from our own activities (scope 1), and of this, 98% of our scope
1 emissions come from ocean transport. Purchased electricity (scope 2) is only 1% of our value chain footprint.
Our supply chain emissions make up the remaining 34% (scope 3), and a substantial part of these are related
to purchased ocean services. As a consequence, out of our total emissions, more than 70% relate to ocean transport, which makes it the natural place for us to focus our efforts in our new CO2 targets.
Our strategy to become an integrator of container logistics and provide customers with easy access to end- to-end services will necessarily lead
to increased activity on land. As we progress, our decarbonisation strategy will also address our land transport and inland assets.

development, customer engagement, and regulatory advocacy.
In addition, we want to begin a dialogue with cargo owners, regulators, researchers, investors and technology developers, and together set the foundation for a sustainable industry.
Zero emissions vessels
on the water by 2030
The pursuit of solutions must begin now. Given the 20-25-year lifetime of a vessel, we must have the first zero- carbon and commercially viable vessel on the seas by 2030. This should be followed by an initial slow ramping up, allowing maturing of technology and supply chain in order to be able to turn around our entire fleet for net-zero carbon emissions in 2050.
This leaves us and the industry only eleven years to find the right solutions for a positive business case for decarbonisation.

  GROWING CUSTOMER INTEREST IN CLIMATE CHANGE
For many of our largest customers, attention to sustainability in their supply chain is growing. We see our customers making bold company commitments to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from their business, in many cases to zero emissions. Currently, 35 of our top 150 customers are using science-based targets and many other customers are working on targets. By reducing emissions in our operations, we can help these customers achieve their CO2 goals and ambitions. A 2018 customer survey showed us that
72% seriously consider sustainability parameters when managing their company’s supply chain, pointing to emissions reductions and low-carbon logistics as their main challenges today. Alongside this dependency, we see an
increasing acknowledgement among these customers that continued and significant CO2 reductions require investments.
Specifically, we see that the number of customer tender requests including climate and other sustainability-related requirements is increasing approx. 30% year on year.
Also, our direct sustainability collaborations or partnerships with 40 key clients over the past five years have evolved from customers making basic demands for CO2 emissions data to more long-term and action-oriented requests for low CO2 solutions along with tangible CO2 reduction pilot projects. We are currently working on offering different low-carbon solutions to our customers across transport modes.
A.P. Moller - Maersk
For the next few years, it is very important not to rule out any solutions. There are several promising technologies at various stages of development. All solutions will come with benefits and challenges to be overcome and only by actively partnering, collaborating and undertaking research and development will we know which ones will win out.
There are several technologies and fuels being developed these years within the areas such as advanced biofuels and hydrogen-based fuels. We are already engaged in research

and test programmes in some of these technologies, for example sustainable biofuels, where we are collaborating with customers and research institutes on development and testing of potential future solutions for low- carbon transportation. Over the coming years, we will expand the range of solutions we are investigating. This
will prepare us for selecting a few candidates we will pursue for the first carbon-neutral vessels.
Delivering on efficiency
We have set a new efficiency target at 60% relative reductions by 2030 with
a 2008 baseline and meeting it will require tremendous efforts. We will be working on a portfolio of solutions for reaching this target. Energy efficiency is a discipline where A.P. Moller - Maersk has excelled for decades, yet we still have potential to improve.
A major contribution will come from replacing older vessels with new and more efficient ones, taking advantage of our continuous work to optimise
hull dimensions, hull shapes, propulsion systems and auxiliary systems, and
in recent years we have consistently demonstrated our ability to design and build vessels that perform 15% more efficiently than our average vessels.
Another large contribution will come from further optimising our network
in terms of both network operations and voyage execution. Over the next few years, we will be able to reap
the benefits from our investments in connecting and digitising our vessels.
For the last part of the reductions in CO2 emissions, we will rely on innovation. We have demonstrated that we are able to innovate and operationalise innovation, and we intend to continue these efforts.
Our 2030 efficiency target is strong enough to ensure that we continue
to decouple CO2 emission levels from growth in trade and volumes shipped. With this target, we will not exacerbate our contribution to climate change while we grow our business, serve global trade and support job creation.

GLOBAL WEATHER IMPACT
USD was the macroeconomic impact of global weather disasters in 2017.
    Physical impacts of climate change
In their 2018 report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly states that the physical effects of climate change are already here in the form of changes in, for example, weather patterns and biodiversity.4 This is substantiated by the fact that in 2017, the macroeconomic impact of global weather disasters was around USD 330 billion, making 2017 one of the costliest years ever.5
As part of our response to climate change, A.P. Moller - Maersk works to manage the risks to our assets as well as the risks to the value of our business, which are caused by the physical impacts of climate change.
Reporting according to TCFD
The TCFD recommends that companies report on both transition risks, understood as risks encountered while working with CO2 reductions, and physical risks which are risks caused by changes in weather etc., within the categories of governance, strategy, risk management and metrics.
Governance
Our climate change targets are part of our sustainability strategy which is owned by the Executive Board.
Strategy
Our transition strategy is described in the previous pages of this report.
To understand and plan for protecting business value from the risks caused by the physical impacts of climate change, we conducted a hot-spot analysis in 2018, estimating the effect of five climate hazards on ports, other fixed assets and strategic commodities within a 2020–2040 timeframe. The five hazards are heat stress, floods, cyclones, water stress and sea level rise.
Based on this overview, we have given priority to the geographical
This work has been pushed further by the investment community’s increased focus on and activity level around climate change and its impacts on businesses seen from a financial risk perspective.
The growing importance of climate change to investors is clearly demonstrated by The Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Its recommendations for corporate reporting on climate change were published in the second half of 2017. We are already reporting against the TCFD framework through the Climate Disclosure Project (CDP).
regions where the value of our business faces the greatest risk, and selected two high-risk clusters which we will investigate more in-depth
in 2019 to deliver what will be our approach to managing risks from physical climate change.
The next step for us is to begin
pilot projects on the ground, to gain a detailed understanding of the value
at risk and not least how we can best approach managing the risk. There is an added complexity to this, given that our assets are always part of a larger ecosystem, which will also be affected by climate change.
Risk management
Climate-related risks and opportunities are part of the Enterprise Risk Management system reporting to

 18 TRANSFORMATION AND OUR BUSINESS | TRADE
Making the case for open and inclusive trade
Open trade enables prosperity and growth for people and societies. But these benefits are not accessible to all. A.P. Moller - Maersk wants to be a cornerstone of an inclusive and sustainable global trading system that can help eradicate poverty and deliver decent work for all.
In 2018, we adopted an ambitious set of commitments to help multiply the benefits of trade (see pages 20–21). We will use our capabilities to reduce complexity in global value chains,
so that more countries and more companies can do business simpler, cleaner, faster and cheaper. We will also work to empower small businesses, the ‘conveyer belts’ of innovation and job creation, to have better access to the benefits of trade.
Trade is key to progress
Looking ahead to 2030, trade will be key to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. On average, 137,000 people have lifted themselves out of poverty every day for the past 25 years.7 Many of them through the jobs and benefits generated by trade. Without cross-border trade, the real incomes of the average consumer would be half what they are today and even less for the poorest.8 By keeping trade open
in the 21st century, extreme poverty may be eradicated for the first time in human history.
Meanwhile, headlines on global trade in 2018 have been dominated by escalating trade tensions. By the end of
2018, we have not seen major effects
on global trade. But in the coming years, we expect that at their current level, trade tensions may reduce growth in containerised trade by around 0.3% annually. This is potentially significant in a global market growing only 2–4%.
Rewriting the rule book on global trade
The current trade tensions go to
the heart of the multilateral rules- based trading system, and include disagreements over dispute resolution, investment protection and fair, market-based competition. There is an acceptance that the rule book on global trade needs updating in these areas
to ensure a level playing field. We are hopeful that WTO member states will agree on reforms to ensure a rules- based global trading system that keeps trade open, market-based and inclusive.
Much depends on whether the changes to the trading rules will happen through the current system
or whether the system as a whole will move away from multilateral solutions. Nevertheless, the current situation presents a unique opportunity and a pressing need to modernise the trading system to make it fit for the next stage
of globalisation. The mutual benefits
of getting this right are too big to squander and the costs of getting it wrong are unacceptable for present and future generations.
Need for inclusive policies
Allowing open access to markets for international exporters may have adverse impacts on people if jobs change or disappear. Where these impacts have not been countered by inclusive public policies, support for open trade has been undermined. To retain public support for open trade, it must be combined with inclusive and gender-sensitive policies in areas such as social protection, education, social dialogue and decent work.
This smart mix of open trade and inclusive policies in turn requires a rules-based trading system in which countries have room to decide when and how they open up to trade. This involves balancing the potential adverse impacts of open trade on specific groups with the overall benefits for workers, companies and consumers
of having access to global markets, lower prices, higher wages and more economic vitality.

This balance differs from one country to another and requires a social contract within each. A modern rules-based trading system is one that accommodates the needs of different countries to strike a balance between opening up and leaving no one behind.
Trade and sustainable consumption
Past industrial revolutions that
lifted the majority of mankind out of extreme poverty in just two centuries,10 were powered by fossil fuels. This is
no longer sustainable. An emerging subject in trade debates is sustainable consumption, often defined as consumption patterns where human activities do not impact the natural environment beyond what this can accommodate.
The dilemma is that this cannot be at the expense of inclusive growth. Shifting consumption patterns, higher prices, and slower growth will affect some countries and some groups harder than others. If left unaddressed, such negative impacts may threaten the acceptance of policies to address climate change. This may particularly impact countries that already struggle with mass unemployment. 600 million new jobs are needed in developing
countries alone by 2030 just to keep up with growing populations.11
The debate and ideas for reconciling the diverging dilemmas and trade-offs are hugely important to the world and to our company. For A.P. Moller - Maersk, the business imperative is clear: to
be sustainable, the global trade and consumption patterns on which we base our business need to be compatible with nature. Shifts in mindsets and innovative solutions will be necessary to achieve sustainable consumption and growth. We are following the conversations closely and understand that we have to be ready to contribute to the solutions. Our work on climate change is a major part of this, as are
the interventions and solutions being developed in our efforts to multiply
the benefits of trade (see next pages).

What we are doing: As a member of the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, A.P. Moller - Maersk provides its expertise in support of trade facilitation projects in developing countries. In 2018, we have contributed to reform projects in India, Sri Lanka, Morocco, Ghana and Kenya. In Ghana, for example – an important hub for regional and
international business in West
Africa – the Alliance works with
the government and the private
sector to introduce fully automated, paperless customs processing. This will significantly speed up clearance and release of goods thereby contributing to a better business environment.14
50%
   The opportunity: Trade needs to be simple. By digitising global trade, we can help remove friction in global supply chains, enabling our customers to trade more. Reducing barriers to trade leads to new growth with the potential to add more than 20 million new jobs to the global economy every year.12
What we are doing: In December 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk and IBM announced the commercial availability of TradeLens, which is an open and neutral industry solution using blockchain technology to facilitate global trade. Today’s cumbersome
and siloed processes for trade documentation, administration and
data sharing creates delays and uncertainties in global supply chains. The cost of such barriers by far exceeds the cost of formal customs tariffs.
TradeLens allows all actors involved in cross-border trade to interact in a simple, secure and real-time environment. This offers significant efficiency gains and new revenue models for all actors in
the logistics ecosystem. As of January 2019 the solution is actively engaged with more than 100 organisations. This includes over 60 network members including nine ocean carriers, three inland carriers, 46 worldwide ports and terminals, and nine customs authorities spanning the globe.

The opportunity: The WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, which came into force last year, is a concrete example of how the world uses the multilateral system to drive progress. Companies in developing countries pay a particularly high price for informal barriers to trade.13 Traffic congestion and administrative barriers – popularly known as ‘red tape’ – cause delays that result in additional costs related to storage, inventory, and penalties for exporters and importers. For many,
in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, these costs can make the difference between trading and not trading. Trade facilitation reform is key to making trade cheaper, faster and more inclusive.

The opportunity: Small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) are ‘conveyor belts’ of innovation and job creation. 95% of all companies are SMEs and
they account for two-thirds of formal sector jobs. Yet they have much less access to the benefits of trade.15 If we can empower small businesses in trade, we can help make economies more inclusive. We foresee that rapid growth in e-commerce will enable more SMEs to connect with global markets. With the right logistics, this can pave the way for a new generation of small companies integrated in global trade capable of
retaining more value from trade and turning this value into decent jobs.
What we are doing: Twill, an online digital shipping platform, offers
small and medium-sized companies
a one-stop solution to view quotes
and place bookings instantly, manage related documents, track shipments
and proactively address changes to the original plan. Combined with our solutions to digitise trade, stronger customer segmentation and better e-commerce logistics, Twill will help small businesses leapfrog into global trade.
Empowering entrepreneurs
through partnerships
In 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk became
a partner to the SheTrades initiative
by the International Trade Centre. The purpose of SheTrades is to enable women entrepreneurs to access the benefits of trade, aiming to connect three million women entrepreneurs
to markets by 2021. This is good for inclusion – but it is also just good business. Closing the global economic gender gap could add 26% to annual global GDP by 2025.16 Together with SheTrades, A.P. Moller - Maersk will help women entrepreneurs in developing countries engage in trade by sharing our expertise on transport and logistics with the women entrepreneurs.
In 2018, we continued our collaboration with ConnectAmericas, a social network for businesses in the Americas, where small and medium-sized enterprises
can gain access to customers, suppliers and investors, receive training on international trade and commerce, and access financing opportunities. In 2018, an A.P. Moller - Maersk training course on logistics had nearly 3,500 registrations and 600 graduates. We are working with the International Development Bank and other ConnectAmericas partners to enable a payment mechanism directly on the platform.

  BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF DIGITISATION
Commerce and logistics are moving towards digitisation. A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed to being at the forefront
of this transformation of our industry. We are digitising our transactions with customers, for example through Twill and Tradelens, as described in the examples above. A range of different business models are evolving in our industry based on blockchain, asset connectivity and transforming data into insights and potential products.
Digitising global trade holds vast potential for removing friction, making economies more inclusive, and for consumers making smarter and more sustainable choices. But there are obvious challenges. Three areas stand out: the future of work in logistics; data privacy and surveillance; and market
concentration through exponential technologies and big data.
First, the future of work in logistics will be marked by increased use of
new technologies in labour-intensive functions. This includes introducing drone delivery, autonomous vehicles and semi-automated warehouses. We are gradually introducing new technology
in our own operations including vessels, containers and terminals, making them more efficient, safer and using data to generate new value. We are working
to find a balanced approach to these changes (read more on page 34).
Second, the rise of big data combined with artificial intelligence and increased use of sensors in global logistics will see concerns over data privacy, algorithmic discrimination and mass surveillance
more closely connected to trade. Protection of data privacy and human rights varies greatly across regions, and we will need to reconcile this with our global commitment to respecting human rights and the privacy of our customers and their customers in turn.
Third is the potential of exponential technologies to result in ‘winner takes all or most’ outcomes. E-commerce is one example. On the one hand, e-commerce can create access for millions of companies to global markets. On the other hand, critics are pointing out that digital trading platforms can lead to excessive market concentration. The challenge will be to ensure that trade remains open and market-based while benefiting from new technologies.

Reducing food loss
– a business opportunity
Working to reduce food loss will create value for a wide range of stakeholders as well as the A.P. Moller - Maersk business.
The issue of food loss and waste
is positioned right in the nexus between the growth and sustainability priorities of A.P. Moller - Maersk. We already transport about 27% of the world’s refrigerated containers and 25% of the world’s food commodities, and our business strategy gives priority to the development and growth of our cold chain business. From a sustainability point of view, our large market share and place in the value chain imply opportunities for leverage to reduce food loss, particularly in the stages where most food loss is generated:
• the production stage, with 500 million tonnes of food lost every year due to planning and handling issues, followed by
• the handling and storage stage, where 350 million tonnes of food is lost every year, due to inadequate storage conditions and time lags in the transportation phase caused by weak organisation of food chains and poor infrastructure.17
What we can do
Our commitment to help halve food
loss by 2030 is a new area in our sustainability strategy established
in 2017. We are currently shaping our activities and growing our insights and understanding of the issue. For example, how inadequate food storage and transportation conditions create large- scale food loss, particularly in emerging markets, and how partnerships can contribute to changing this situation.
The ultimate goal is to build capabilities along the supply chain in countries with high prevalence of food loss in the production and transportation stages and enhance their ability to
benefit from food loss-reducing solutions. This includes capacity building to reduce post-harvest loss by improving harvesting techniques and handling of products, as well as improving framework conditions for agriculture, infrastructure and trade, which will help governments fulfil national food loss targets.
“

Director, Food, The Rockefeller Foundation
Furthermore, enhanced capabilities at the production stage, adequate infrastructure and trade conditions
as well as temperature-controlled transportation can enable landlocked countries to access ocean shipping with their perishable goods, as they can be transported with freshness intact to trading ports, even if these are located thousands of kilometres away. This enables producers to participate in global trade.
Building partnerships
Aspiring to create shared value,
A.P. Moller - Maersk in 2018 worked
to establish partnerships to pilot solutions to the food loss occurring in the production, handling and storage stages.
In 2018, we mapped relevant organisations for potential partnerships, and we signed a memorandum of understanding with the International Finance Corporation on future cooperation for business-driven food loss projects at country level. We are further pursuing a selected number of global multi-stakeholder partnership opportunities.
Together with the Rockefeller Foundation and the agriculture training NGO, Technoserve, we are establishing pilot projects in Kenya and Nigeria, with an aim to expand our activities in the food value chain in East Africa and get closer to the harvest and collection level.
Wide-reaching potential benefits
With the projected global population growth in the coming decades, the demand for perishable food is projected to increase by 20% annually. It is
clear that with the current system's inefficiencies, meeting this demand will put an even more unsustainable pressure on resources such as land and water,
and increase CO2 emissions at a time where these need to decrease. One way to address this challenge is to make the system more efficient and sustainable, and we want to contribute to this.
If successful, our partnership- based efforts to halve food loss by 2030 will have multiple benefits, as farmers will have more crops to sell, and communities will benefit from job creation with ensuing local economic development.

       GETTING INDIAN BANANAS TO EUROPE
India is the world’s largest producer of bananas with about 30% share of global production. However, nearly a quarter of production is wasted due to lack of infrastructure and transport capability. Furthermore, India exports less than 1% of its production.
A.P. Moller - Maersk is working on a project together with India’s National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) and farmers in the Theni district in South India. For the first time, the banana trail will be mapped, as the fruit travels through a cold chain.
The goal is to get the export time below 45 days to allow exports to the
EU market. This will open a market of
at least three million tonnes of banana export, while at the same time preventing the loss of this perishable commodity.

 24 TRANSFORMATION AND OUR BUSINESS | SHIP RECYCLING
Momentum towards responsible ship recycling in Alang
The journey to transform ship recycling continues with a multi-stakeholder partnership to increase transparency. A significant number of yards in Alang, India are now investing in responsible practices.
Despite strong and documented criticism of the environmental, health and safety conditions on the ship recycling beaches in Southeast Asia, 90% of vessels were still dismantled there in 2018.18 This is the case in spite of several shipowners having policies for responsible ship recycling. A key factor in this is the lack of international regulations on ship recycling because the Hong Kong Convention on ship recycling, established by the IMO in 2009, still has not entered into force, as it has yet to be ratified by the required number of countries.
In 2016, A.P. Moller - Maersk embarked on a journey to radically change global ship recycling towards responsible practices and avoid the high level of
negative impacts of non-regulated
ship recycling on beaches. We chose Alang, India, as the location where we would work on the ground to prove the viability of more options for responsible ship recycling. As part of this process, we wanted to change the way Alang works – both inside the yards and in the wider community. We remain fully committed to investing in changing this very real and very difficult problem for the shipping industry, living up to our values and ambitions for this area.
Improving fast
A.P. Moller - Maersk has since 2016 sent a total of seven vessels for dismantling in four different yards in Alang and
placed our supervision teams on the ground during working hours in the yards working on our vessels. The premise for doing this was our belief that it is possible to bring yards in Alang to comply with A.P. Moller - Maersk’s responsible ship recycling standard. At all three yards
we have worked with in 2018, regular audit findings against our standard were reduced to just one outstanding within three to six months. The yards did not commence the recycling operations until the audits proved responsible practices.
The one remaining finding concerns excessive working hours, a notoriously difficult challenge for global industries to work with in Asian countries. The challenge is enhanced by the fact
that legal migrant workers, who often request as many paid hours of work as possible, make up more than 90% of the Alang workforce.
Two years after we sent our first
two vessels to Alang under the Maersk Responsible Ship Recycling Standard, it has been proven that both responsible and commercial ship recycling is possible. When working according to our standards, the yards we work with are achieving audit results on par with yards in Turkey and China. This proves that change is possible provided that the right skills, mindset and investments are in place.
Several more yards are now approved for bidding on A.P. Moller - Maersk- owned vessels destined for ship recycling, and a large number of other yards are today either compliant with IMO’s Hong Kong Convention or on a journey towards compliance (see table on next page). We find that we have witnessed and helped propel this great
“
 The Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative is one of those rare initiatives that succeeds
in marrying the interests of shippers, environmental and social stakeholders and responsible carriers. In
vessel recycling, knowledge is power and transparency is progress, which is why I have high h”opes for SRTI.

progress in Alang. It does not, however, change the fact that international legislation will be necessary to create a level playing field in ship recycling.
The EU List
The European Union (EU) is set to introduce its own ship recycling safety and environmental standards from
the start of 2019. Under these rules, vessels carrying EU flags at the end of their life cannot be recycled in yards not approved by the EU. Yards approved by the EU will be included in what is known as ‘the EU List’.
The incentive to get on the EU
List is currently encouraging the transformation of Alang seen in the many yards investing in change (see table below). We believe the EU can be a real driver for sustaining investment and upgrading in the whole area by including Indian yards that comply with EU regulations in the EU List.
The current version of the list comprises 23 facilities from within the EU and three non-EU facilities (one in the US and two in Turkey).19 The list does not yet include Indian yards, however, it will be updated on an ongoing basis.
In 2018, 11 yards in Alang have officially asked to be added to the EU List. Out of these, two were inspected and conclusions were not available by the end of 2018. We strongly believe that transparency in the assessment process is crucial to keep improving conditions in Alang.

   transformation we are aiming for. For this reason, we welcomed the launch in 2018 of the Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative (SRTI), in which we participate together with five other shipowners
and six financial institutions. Two of our large-brand customers are active on
the advisory panel.
Through an annual survey, the SRTI encourages all shipowners to report on their ship recycling practices against a comprehensive set of disclosure criteria. The information collected will form a public database providing transparency and in turn accountability for choices made in the dismantling of end of life- vessels. The SRTI’s online platform was launched in December 2018.
Introducing health services
to the Alang community
Another stated vision for engaging with ship recycling yards in Alang was to contribute to improving conditions for the wider Alang community.
In late 2017, a survey was carried out to establish gaps in existing health care services if the needs of the workers and their families were to be met. It concluded that both general and emergency health care services were sorely lacking.
A.P. Moller - Maersk and partners Indian Red Cross and the Ship Recycling Industry Association (SRIA) established a mobile health van with a team of professionals that provides general health care to all ship recycling workers in Alang as well as to the local community of the wider Alang area.
Since May 2018, nearly 10,000 people from the wider Alang area received free, general health care from the health van, improving access to health services significantly.
For 2019, developing emergency care will be in focus. We will work with local health sector partners to be able to offer basic emergency care services in Alang, and to offer first aid training of the yard workers.

Progress, actions and ambitions
A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed to ensuring that our business practices are safe, responsible and transparent.
In this section, we provide a brief and concise overview of progress, actions and ambitions on responsible business practices on 11 issues. We work on these issues by managing risk as well as by living up to the responsibility defined by our Core Values and the principles of the UN Global Compact on human rights, labour rights, environment and anti-corruption.
The issue of personal safety for our employees merits particular attention because our approach to safety has undergone a thorough review and renewal in 2018.
On all other responsibility and risk issues
in this section, we report across selected key categories of disclosure including ambitions; why the issue is important and how it is material; targets for 2018 (as reported in our 2017 Sustainability Report); targets for 2019 or ahead, if revised; progress for this year; and governance. We also connect our work with the relevant UN SDG targets and indicators.

 28 PROGRESS, ACTIONS AND AMBITIONS | SAFETY
Safety:
A fundamental shift
Focusing on leadership, organisational capacity, operational controls and employee engagement will propel us forward in the next phase of employee safety.
At the beginning of 2018, the
A.P. Moller - Maersk Executive Board decided to conduct a thorough review of the company’s safety performance, as no significant improvements had been achieved during the past 4–5 years.
The review showed that we had reached a plateau in safety performance, with the frequency of incidents not improving. More importantly, high- consequence events, particularly those resulting in fatalities, continued to
occur. In the past five years alone, 34 colleagues have lost their lives while working for A.P. Moller - Maersk.
The loss of five colleagues due to a fire on the Maersk Honam in March 2018 only underlined the need for A.P. Moller - Maersk to reevaluate its safety approach.
As a result, the Executive Board appointed a safety task force, chaired by Vice CEO Claus V. Hemmingsen, charged with reviewing and re-thinking the company’s approach to safety and focusing on making A.P. Moller - Maersk a Safe Place to Work.
2018 OVERVIEW OF FATALITIES
The need for a re-orientation of A.P. Moller - Maersk’s approach to safety was, as mentioned above, sadly reinforced by a fire aboard the Maersk Honam. In addition to the high-level task force’s work, new guidelines on the stowage of dangerous goods
“
The conclusions and recommendations were approved by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors in the autumn of 2018, leading to a significant change in our approach going forward, rebooting our safety efforts to ensure safety is embedded in all aspects of the organisation, and involving every part
of the business, every employee and all business processes.
Three main elements
Moving forward, addressing three priorities becomes critical:
• Leadership accountability – all
leaders must be fully and emotionally
engaged in and committed to safety; • Capacity for safe operations – stronger
focus on ensuring effective controls for high-potential events, in addition to ongoing efforts to reduce minor accidents; and
• Building the right culture for safety
– move away from a culture focused almost exclusively on individual actions and responsibility and more towards becoming a learning organisation, with organisational capacity and
operational controls in place and with high levels of employee engagement.
Clear authority, roles, tasks, and objectives for safety at all levels in the company are and will remain important parts of the safety transformation journey.
Impacts of change come later
The new safety approach will be rolled out from leadership level, starting January 2019. To guide the process
of change, a new corporate safety function was established in late 2018, to formulate the overall safety strategy and to facilitate best practice sharing and governance across the company.
In 2018, our overall LTIf has increased to 1.29 from 0.89 (see side bar). This is primarily due to a positive change in safety maturity across our terminals where improvements in employee engagement have led to increased transparency in the reporting of lost time injuries. There has also been an increase in the number of terminal facilities fully in scope for reporting on safety.
The safety of our employees is
our responsibility and focus, and
the loss of seven colleagues in 2018 alone, clearly underlines the need for change in our safety approach to make sure all employees can go to work not only feeling safe, but being safe.

Building capacity for safety
Through consultation with global safety experts and best practice organisations within safety, we learned that a focus on zero accidents alone is not a sufficient motivator. A far better motivator and guide post is the core belief that safety is not the absence of accidents, but the presence of capacity and effective controls to eliminate as many of the factors contributing to the occurrence of accidents and managing the outcome of an accident.
We have previously targeted zero accidents. Going forward, the target
we communicate and use as motivator is to make A.P. Moller - Maersk a safe place to work. We will encourage the elimination of the risk of accidents through designing a safe work place where as many risk factors as possible are controlled, and focusing not on who failed, but on what failed.
We will set this course to ensure that if and when we do have accidents, the organisation is able to ‘fail safely’ so that high-potential events do not result in permanent and life-changing injuries or fatalities.
A real-life example of this approach is the safety features in ordinary
cars. Our new approach is similar to
the existence of seat belts, air bags, reversing alarms, non-skid brake systems etc. In comparison, our previous approach to safety also had some
level of risk control, but relied mostly on instructions to ‘drivers’ focused on not placing the car too close to other objects or not to brake too hard on slippery surfaces.
The change in our approach to safety does not mean that we discard our management systems and procedures. They are the backbone of a safe working environment and are based
on years of experience and learning. However, more procedures and rules instructing people not to get hurt will not be more effective.
Instead, what we believe will take
us further on our safety journey is a non-wavering focus on being a safe place to work, where we see and engage every one of the people working for
A.P. Moller - Maersk – from deck hands to executives – as continuous learners and sharing the responsibility for all of us to return home safely after work.

   IN BRIEF
AMBITIONS
Our overriding ambition is to ensure that A.P. Moller - Maersk is a safe place to work.
TARGETS
2018:
• Zero fatalities
• Continuous improvement in targets
for lost-time incidents going towards zero.
2019:
New targets for safety will be developed in 2019, aligned with the new approach to focus on building resilience, capacity and controls. This still entails the ambition of no colleagues losing their life working for A.P. Moller - Maersk in 2019.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Safety at work is a basic human right, and workplace conditions directly influence workers as well as their families and communities. Keeping our people safe
is our first and primary responsibility as a company, a core value for us and an unequivocal expectation from
our employees, their families and communities. A.P. Moller - Maersk, however, still sees fatal accidents occurring as part of our operations.

Air emissions: SOx and NOx
AMBITIONS
Our key ambition is to comply with
air emissions regulations and drive regulatory enforcement towards a level playing field.
TARGETS
2018:
• Maintain or implement solutions that will enable full compliance with regulatory demands.
• Develop positions alone and with others to level the playing field.
• Fully comply with regulatory demands.
2019:
• Fully comply with regulatory demands and continue investing in maintaining and implementing solutions that will enable this.
• Actively engage at international and regional level to secure a level playing field across the industry.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Air emissions from ocean-going shipping have negative effects
on human health and the natural environment. We support regulation which will significantly reduce these effects, as evidenced by a 2018 survey showing that areas in Europe with regulation-limited sulphur content in fuel saw a drop in sulphur concentrations in the air by up to
SOX NON-COMPLIANCE CASES 2018
60%. But, without a level playing
field in terms of compliance and
the enforcement of regulation, the competitiveness and profitability of compliant companies will be hurt. The International Maritime Organisation’s 0.5% global cap on sulphur dioxide (SOx) content in fuels for shipping will enter into force from 1 January 2020. To enable enforcement of the global cap, the IMO in 2018 decided on a carriage ban for non-compliant fuels on board vessels. Vessels with scrubbers cleaning the exhaust gasses installed are exempted from this ban. OECD estimates the cost of switching to new, compliant fuels at up to USD 15 billion per year for the container shipping industry.20 Our own estimation is around USD 2 billion annually for
A.P. Moller - Maersk alone.
PROGRESS IN 2018
To prepare for the 2020 global cap, we:
the increased fuel costs, allowing customers to predict the actual extra cost of shipping for them at different fuel cost scenarios.
• Developed new standard operating procedures to ensure that the new, blended, compliant fuels will not cause operational problems.
• Invested in scrubbers on a share of our vessels. Scrubber technology is a less extensive element of our sulphur cap fuel sourcing strategy, the vast majority of our container vessels
will comply using low sulphur fuels. In 2017, we publicly stated that we would not rely on this technology, but for the time being we need to secure that we are not overly reliant on a single means of compliance.
NOx
IMO legislation exists to achieve progressive reductions in NOx emissions from ships. It is being implemented through the establishment of NOx emission control areas (NECAs).
A.P. Moller - Maersk is preparing for
the 2021 enforcement of NECAs in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea.

Our work is guided by a steering committee on SOx compliance and readiness.

Spills
AMBITIONS
Zero oil spills.
TARGETS
2018 and 2019:
Zero non-contained oil spills above 10 m3.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Large-scale oil spills may have documented, long-lasting impacts on human health and/or the environment. Spill incidents also have the potential to cause severe injuries and fatalities. Our business may suffer financial damages through fines and recovery operations, as well as reputational damage. The
risk of oil spills is highest in terms of
likelihood in relation to fuel transfers. In terms of environmental impact, vessel collisions carry the highest risk profile along with land-side bulk hydrocarbon and chemical handling.
PROGRESS IN 2018
• No oil spills over the 10 m3 limit were reported in 2018.
• A new global operating standard
for Spill Prevention, Control and Response was rolled out across our terminals and inland service depots, with all locations completing spill risks assessments at their facilities, and implementing improvement plans over the short to medium-term to reduce spill risks by strengthening prevention controls, and better
preparing, resourcing and testing response plans. As part of the implementation of the new standard, an environmental performance objective was included in our terminals’ performance scorecard for the first time.
GOVERNANCE
Our efforts to avoid spills are governed through the rules and guidance on HSE management stated in the central
A.P. Moller - Maersk governance system.

AMBITIONS
We aim to eliminate corruption in the maritime industry through both multi- stakeholder collaboration and our own operations.
TARGETS
2018 and 2019:
Comply with legislation on anti-corrupt practices, which ultimately translates to zero bribery and facilitation payments.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Corruption undermines social and economic development. It destabilises the business environment, adds to the cost of participating in global trade
and has significant negative impact on the markets and countries we operate in. Furthermore, it affects external confidence (public trust) as well as company morale. For A.P. Moller - Maersk, non-compliance with legislation on bribery and corruption may lead to
legal and reputational risks, extra
costs, inefficiencies in our business and ultimately debarment from markets.
Risk of corruption is found primarily in our interactions with authorities over controls and approvals in ports and border controls, mostly in the shape of facilitation payments. Risk of corruption in our supply chain is managed
through our Responsible Procurement programme (see page 32).
PROGRESS IN 2018
• On own ships we have managed, in close collaboration between crew and shore, to decrease facilitation payments over the last three years by 99.97%.
• In 2018, 98% of chartered vessels reported monthly, and approximately 88% are in compliance with the
A.P. Moller - Maersk Anti-Corruption Policy. These results are achieved through clear communication and collaboration between the vessels, the shipowners and Maersk, making it very clear that we support the crew in avoiding any payments.
• Began work to consolidate existing anti-corruption programmes into one common A.P. Moller - Maersk programme in line with the company’s strategy, including an upgraded compliance programme. The programme is based on current compliance standards, including, but not limited to, risk assessment, training and communication.
• Continued membership of the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network.
• Four cases related to corruption
were reported through the whistleblower hotline. Three cases have been investigated and closed
as unsubstantiated. One case is currently being investigated and dealt with according to the procedure in the whistleblower system.
GOVERNANCE

Responsible procurement
AMBITIONS
Manage the risk of supplier non- compliance with our Third-Party Code of Conduct.
TARGETS
• Ensure compliance with Third-Party Code of Conduct.
• Introduce ‘country risk’ as additional criteria for engagement.
• Introduce assessment approach to the high-risk category ‘terminals’.
The last two targets replace a previous target. This change was made as part of a re-evaluation of the Responsible Procurement programme in 2018.
2019:
• Ensure compliance with Third-Party Code of Conduct.
• Sharpen the focus on risk management through ‘risk score’ methodology.
• Align supplier due diligence processes across segments in a consistent manner.
AUDITS AND ASSESSMENTS IN 2018
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
International companies’ purchasing decisions impact environmental, social and economic conditions around the world. For A.P. Moller - Maersk, the trust in our brand and leadership will be damaged, if we are unable to monitor and address our supply chain sustainability risks.
PROGRESS IN 2018
We focus on suppliers in high-risk categories and countries in our transportation and logistics activities. We engage with approximately 3,000 suppliers through due diligence activities such as audits, self- assessments, documentation reviews, and improvement plans. This number has doubled since 2017, due to the inclusion of the trucking category. It is out of a population of 24,000 suppliers with whom we have a contract and a total population of 72,000 suppliers.
• Performed 40 audits and 1,029 self-assessments of suppliers.
• Added high-risk countries to the high-risk categories as an additional criterion for engagement.
• Further integrated our pre-qualifier questionnaire for the trucking category.
• Continued work on subcontractor conditions, particularly in shipbuilding yards and terminal construction sites with due diligence through audits and improvement plans.
• Conducted focused training on labour relations through a joint programme with Global Employee Relations team.
• Piloted an assessment approach for the supplier category ‘terminals’ at 10 terminals in high-risk countries.
We were alerted by a Danish media outlet to a sub-contractor’s working conditions in Mombasa’s port terminal, operated by Kenya Ports Authority, which was not in compliance with
our Third-Party Code of Conduct. We investigated the case and are addressing the gaps identified.
As a member of the UN Global Compact Action Platform on Decent Work in Global Supply Chains, we have signed six broad commitments on decent work in global supply chains.

Human rights
AMBITIONS
Ensure that we prevent and address adverse human rights impacts associated with our business activities.
• Full integration of human rights in sustainability governance.
2019: •
• Anchor human rights due diligence
in the company’s overall governance
system.
• Continue to close identified gaps in
relation to standards for employees in our company and in the supply chain.
• Conduct further analysis of human rights risks related to the digitisation of our business.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Human rights are a precondition for freedom and dignity for people, for rule of law and for inclusive and sustainable growth on which we depend as a business. Respect for human rights
is rooted in our values and key to our licence to operate from employees, customers, investors, communities, governments and other stakeholders. National reporting requirements related to human rights are generally on the rise.
HUMAN RIGHTS IN THIS REPORT
As a company with a global presence, we support effective and balanced regulation that promotes a global level playing field for responsible business.
PROGRESS IN 2018
• Initiated efforts to integrate human 2018: rights in sustainability governance
• Under the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) convention, commercial vessels are obligated to assist persons in distress at sea, and governments are obligated to facilitate the disembarkation of rescued persons at a safe port. We take pride in meeting our SOLAS responsibility in a manner which respects human rights standards.
In 2018, our vessels participated in two search and rescue missions at sea rescuing a total of 127 persons. An incident involving the Maersk Alexander in June 2018 received international attention, as our vessel waited four days for permission to disembark the rescued persons.
• Published our third annual statement under the UK Modern Slavery Act.
GOVERNANCE
Human rights due diligence is part
of our sustainability management process which is overseen by the Executive Board. In addition, human rights provisions are embedded into
a number of programmes in the areas of safety, employee relations, diversity and inclusion, security, responsible procurement and responsible ship recycling (see the table below).

 34 PROGRESS, ACTIONS AND AMBITIONS | EMPLOYEE RELATIONS AND DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
Employee relations
AMBITIONS
All our employees will be treated fairly in a safe and healthy working environment with constructive and productive working relationships between managers, employees and employee representatives.
TARGETS
2018 and 2019:
Ensure compliance with the
A.P. Moller - Maersk governance document on Global Employee Relations, which is based on internationally recognised labour standards.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
A positive relationship with our employees and nurturing diversity is fundamental to our success as a business. This begins with ensuring respect for internationally recognised human rights and labour standards in all our workplaces.
PROGRESS IN 2018
As due diligence, we carried out a company-wide self-assessment of the compliance with our Rule on Global Employee Relations in 180 entities worldwide. Based on the assessment, we have initiated improvement actions in the following areas:
• Working hours and overtime: The most frequent challenge and a continuous focus. In 2018, we made a policy on working hours specifically addressing challenges at our container factory in China.
• Compensation: Cases occur where wage differences depend on employment status or nationality.
In a few countries, where inflation and costs of living are rising rapidly, salaries may not enable employees to meet basic needs.
• Equal treatment: Reports of employment decisions influenced by factors such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, religion or sexual orientation were dealt with through internal grievance systems.
• Freedom of association: We are present in countries where independent trade unions are prohibited by law. We seek to honour our principles for employee relations while also complying with the law. We have taken steps to increase consistency in the way this is managed locally.
• Forced labour: We operate in countries where local laws and practices may require employees to obtain approval from their current employer before changing jobs. There are also cases where employees are granted loans by the company. We have taken further steps to reduce the risk of bonded labour.
• Third-party staff: People hired through third parties who work for us for long periods of time. The due diligence assessment has helped us strengthen implementation of our Third-Party Code of Conduct in areas such as pay and working hours.
We rolled out a company-wide e-learning programme on Global Employee Relations, which is mandatory for all employees and covers the international labour standards that are most salient to our business. Alongside this, we continued specialised training for employees working with manning agencies, with a focus on our inland service operations.
Our whistleblower system received
31 HR-related cases, including cases related to potential infringements
of our principles on Global Employee Relations. These are investigated and dealt with according to the procedure in the whistleblower system.
GOVERNANCE
Employee relations at A.P. Moller - Maersk are governed according to our policy
on Global Employee Relations based
on international labour standards. The Global Employee Relations Council, reporting to the Chief Human Resources Officer, oversees compliance.

                                           CLOSING TWO FACTORIES
Following thorough evaluation of market prospects, Maersk Container Industry decided in June 2018 to close its container factory in San Antonio, Chile. Further, in January 2019 we decided to exit the dry container manufacturing business, which meant closing the factory in Dongguan, China.
The closures sadly affected the jobs of 3,400 employees. We are committed to taking care of the people that are impacted by these difficult decisions and we thank them for their dedication and hard work over the years.
Following the announcement of the closure of the plant in Chile, the trade union organising 50% of the employees
directed a complaint to the OECD National Contact Point (NCP) in Chile. The complaint argued that the running and closure of the factory violated the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. The alleged violations concerned equal pay as well as consultation processes during the closure.
We conducted a review of the allegations and found that our running and closure of the factory complied with all legal requirements as well as international standards for responsible business conduct. We presented the outcome of this review to the NCP, and on that basis respectfully declined the NCP’s offer of a further mediation.
NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN THE WORKPLACE
The increase in technological innovation in our industry generates uncertainty among our employees and trade unions. In 2018, we established a set of guiding principles to support our approach. We believe that by addressing these changes in a proactive manner, technology will enable us to create better and more productive jobs for the benefit of the company and our employees. We are committed to:
• Timely identification of upcoming technological changes, so that we can support our employees in building the skills required.
• Proactive and open dialogue with employees and their representative bodies. In 2018, we met with trade union representatives from the International Transport Workers’ Federation to openly share and discuss our approach and plans for technical innovations in our business.
• Ensuring that we have support in place for employees whose jobs disappear due to the adoption of new technologies.
  INTRODUCTION STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE TRANSFORMATION AND OUR BUSINESS PROGRESS, ACTIONS AND AMBITIONS PROGRESS OVERVIEW
DATA AND ASSURANCE 35
Diversity and inclusion
AMBITIONS
We aspire to create an inclusive culture where employees from every background can contribute to their fullest. In doing this, we will be in a prime position to attract people from the widest talent pool, specifically increasing the gender and nationality diversity at our senior levels.
TARGETS
2018 and 2019:
• Target for representation of women on the Board of Directors (see graphic below).
• Target for representation of women and persons from countries that are not in the OECD high-income countries list (see graphic below).
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
It is a basic obligation and a core element of our values not to discriminate against our employees. Discrimination bars people from living up to their full potential, creates inequality as well as less stable and prosperous societies. We also want to leverage the competitive advantage that diverse teams and inclusive cultures can bring to our business.
PROGRESS IN 2018
We set global targets that help us monitor progress on representation of gender and nationality in management (see graphic below). We are not satisfied with the 2018 progress, and expect our investments in the agenda will positively impact the results in the future.
The current targets are not seen as end points, but as steps along the way. We aim to create more micro targets for specific parts of the employee life cycle. These include gender recruitment targets, balanced with always hiring
the best person for the job, and a target maternity return rate of 90% (currently at 73%). Since 2016, we have offered a global minimum of 18 weeks’ maternity leave on full pay for all employees, and the option to work 20% less hours at full pay for up to six months within the first year of childbirth or adoption.
1. Inclusive leadership capabilities
• Continued roll-out of workshops focusing on understanding and mitigating unconscious bias across leadership levels.
• Developed and prepared 2019 launch of a new e-learning programme for all employees.
• Delivered unconscious bias training during key restructuring projects embedding diversity when making people decisions.
2. Local and leader-led agendas
• The CEO of A.P. Moller - Maersk committed to the European Roundtable pledge on Inclusion.
• Continued development of regional and brand-owned diversity and inclusion strategies.
3. Engaging our employees in the diversity and inclusion agenda
• Signed up to the UN LGBTI Standards for Business as part of our existing commitment to human rights and established a website with guidance and tools for line management.
• Celebrated International People with Disabilities day, our first step in engaging employees globally on disability inclusion.
• Local and regional initiatives rolled out by employee networks.
• Close to 300 women across the company engaged through our women’s development programme, which also provides virtual learning for its 1000 alumni.
GOVERNANCE
Our Diversity and Inclusion programme is managed through the human resources department. Standards for non-discrimination of employees are part of the Global Employee Relations governance document.

Disaster response
AMBITIONS
To act in accordance with our values
by using our leverage and logistics capabilities to support response efforts to large natural disasters and in complex emergencies.
TARGETS
2018 and 2019:
• Participate, as part of the Logistics Emergency Team (LET), in filling operational gaps in case of complex emergencies and large-scale natural disasters.
• Contribute in LET preparedness activities such as training and knowledge sharing on transport and logistics capacity as well as site access at selected locations.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
When natural or human-incurred disaster strikes, emergency logistics
services are a key factor. Having
aid reach the impacted areas more quickly and efficiently saves lives. Our deep knowledge of logistics and global presence allows us to deliver on this need, and we see it as a clear responsibility to do so.
PROGRESS IN 2018
Our disaster response efforts are mainly carried out through the Logistics Emergency Team (LET) which comprises four global logistics and transportation companies: UPS, A.P. Moller - Maersk, Agility and DP World. The LET supports the Global Logistics Cluster, led by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), which provides emergency responses to complex humanitarian crises and natural disasters. In 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk:
• Increased our allocation of time and
resources to also respond to human- incurred disasters in addition to natural disasters.
• Contributed to the response plan following the earthquake in Indonesia in September, with information on the country’s infrastructure and ocean freight options, and reserving containers to support disaster relief if needed.
• After a cholera outbreak in Yemen
in 2017, we collaborated with LET partners in donating four refrigerated containers to store medical supplies.
• Continued to map freight and logistics options to secure the Global Logistics Cluster’s preparedness in risk-prone areas.
GOVERNANCE
The Executive Board decides on activation of support to large-scale natural disasters upon request from the Global Logistics Cluster. A dedicated contact point coordinates requests from the LET to A.P. Moller - Maersk representatives in relevant locations.
of this assessment, we began collection of information regarding tax incentives throughout the world, and development of procedures for reporting of taxes paid at country level.
We operate globally, including in
some countries that are listed as non- cooperative by the EU or other tax authorities. We do not engage in tax avoidance activities. Out of the five countries on the EU list for 2018, we have a Maersk Line Agency and a shore branch for a drill ship in Trinidad & Tobago.
GOVERNANCE
Our approach to tax is directed by the A.P. Moller - Maersk Tax Principles
and governed in line with the rules
and guidance stated in the central
A.P. Moller - Maersk governance system.

AMBITIONS
As a citizen of the oceans, we will contribute to protecting the health of oceans, and continuously reduce our own impacts.
TARGETS
• Mature the partnership with the World Ocean Council and the science community.
• Explore partnership opportunities in the marine plastic litter community.
• All vessels are compliant with the IMO Ballast Water Management Convention.
2019:
• All vessels are compliant with the IMO Ballast Water Management Convention.
• Continue collaboration with the Ocean Cleanup Project.
• Support ocean science research through data collection and partnerships.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Ocean health is pivotal to the health
of nature and people. Higher sea temperatures and the proliferation of plastic waste indicate that ocean health is under threat. We are obligated to
act, as emissions from our activities contribute to acidification and rising temperatures, and as a citizen of the oceans to contribute to finding solutions.
• Collaborated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), under the U.S. Department of Commerce, to deploy 16 drifter buoys which as part of NOAA’s network of around 1,000 buoys collect data for marine and climate sciences. During 2019, we will continue to work with NOAA in collaboration with the World Ocean Council’s ‘Smart Oceans – SMART Industries’ initiative to develop
a programme to improve data
collection from selected areas.
• Joined and launched the UN Global
Compact Sustainable Ocean Business Action Platform, a three-year project.

PROGRESS IN 2018
We registered one case of reported non-compliance with ballast water regulation in Montreal, Canada. The case was related to reporting errors and we received a fine of USD 9,100. Established collaboration with the Ocean Cleanup project, contributing around USD 2.0 million in vessel services and equipment for the installation of the first full-scale ocean plastic clean-up system, as well as providing open-top containers for the collected plastic.
  HELPING THE OCEAN CLEANUP PROJECT SUCCEED
Over 5 trillion pieces of plastic are estimated to litter all the major ocean basins. The source of this problem is primarily insufficient waste management on land, rivers and sea. Therefore, making the oceans healthy will require a multi-layer solution with a multitude of innovation and change.
As responsible citizens of the ocean, we want to contribute to alleviating the problem by assisting in removing the plastic which is already in the oceans.
The Ocean Cleanup Project, a non-profit organisation, has developed a 600 m-long floating buoy system with a screen to collect plastic debris for recycling.
The first offshore cleaning system was towed and installed by a Maersk Supply Service vessel in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, located 1,200 nautical miles off the coast of San Francisco. The patch contains an estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic and covers an area twice the size of Texas. After installation, our vessels are further monitoring progress and operations.
At the end of 2018, the installment malfunctioned and was towed back to shore with terabytes of data ready to be used to develop necessary upgrades. Our vessel also carried around 2,000 kg of plastic that had been recovered from the patch.
The Ocean Cleanup Project’s long-term ambition is to install at least 60 systems to remove 50% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch within five years.

   INTRODUCTION STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE TRANSFORMATION AND OUR BUSINESS PROGRESS, ACTIONS AND AMBITIONS PROGRESS OVERVIEW DATA AND ASSURANCE 41
COMMENTS ON 2018 PERFORMANCE DATA
Social performance Our employees
Increase in total number of employees is due to the acquisition of Hamburg Süd.
The increase in target nationalities in leadership for A.P. Moller - Maersk is due to different entities that we are reporting on. The entities for 2018 have a steady number of target nationalities and fewer non-target nationalities at this level, therefore the % of target nationalities has increased.
Further comments on our performance on diversity and inclusion, along with our targets and performance on representation of women on the Board of Directors and representation of women and persons from countries that are not in the OECD high-income countries list, can be found on p. 35.
LTIf has increased mainly due to a positive change in safety maturity across our terminals where improvements in employee engagement have led to increased transparency in the reporting of lost time injuries. There has also been an increase in the number of terminal facilities fully in scope for reporting on safety. More details about our safety performance can be found on pages 28–29.
Environmental performance
Energy consumption
Fleet of vessels has grown 8% due to the acquisition of Hamburg Süd. Increase in fuel oil is also caused by more vessel days deployed and the addition of new services. No material change in natural gas consumption from continuing operations as compared to 2017.
Increase in other fuels consumption for continuing operations due to improved reporting processes for our terminal facilities.
Increase in electricity consumption from continuing operations due to the acquisition of Hamburg Süd as well as improved reporting processes for our terminal facilities. Increase in energy consumption (total, TJ) is due to the increase in fuel oil consumption.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
Increase in GHG emissions is due to increases in energy consumption.
98% of our scope 1 emissions come from the operations of our fleet. Increase in direct GHG emissions is due to increase in fuel oil consumption.
Decrease in indirect GHG emissions is partly due to decrease in electricity consumption.
Other air emissions
SOx is produced from the combustion of heavy fuel oil. Increase in SOx emissions is due to increases in fuel oil consumption.
NOx is produced from the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen gases in the air during combustion of fuels. Increase in NOx emissions is due to increases in fuel oil consumption. Other resource consumption
Increase is mainly due to changed methodology for calculating waste generation on our vessels (see Accounting Principles 2018). 2017 and 2018 numbers are non-comparable. Decrease in water consumption for continuing operations is primarily due to improved reporting processes in two of our terminals.*
Spills (hydrocarbon)
No spills above the threshold of >10m3.
Economic performance
Financial data is taken from the audited Annual Report of A.P. Moller - Maersk. The annual accounts and independent auditors’ report can be found at http://investor.maersk.com/
* Two of our terminals accounted for approximately 1/3 of the reduction in water consumption for continuing operations. There is a decrease in all indicators for discontinued operations due to the sale of Maersk Oil.

 42 DATA AND ASSURANCE | ASSURANCE
Independent assurance report
To the Stakeholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S
A. P. Møller - Mærsk A/S engaged us to provide limited assurance on the data and information described below and set out in the Sustainability Report of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Our conclusion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to believe that data and information in the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 are without any material misstatements and have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting policies as stated on https://www.maersk.com/about/sustainability/reports.
This conclusion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of our report.
What we are assuring
The scope of our work was limited to assurance over data and information in the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Professional standards applied and level of assurance
We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) ‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information’. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response
to the assessed risks; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.
Our independence and quality control
We have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which includes independence and other ethical requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our work was carried out by an independent multidisciplinary team with experience in sustainability reporting and assurance.

Understanding reporting and measurement methodologies
Data and information need to be read and understood together with the accounting principles https://www.maersk.com/about/sustainability/reports, which Management are solely responsible for selecting and applying. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.
Work performed
We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the data and information. In doing so and based on our professional judgement, we:
• Conducted interviews with management at corporate and Brand level

2018 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report and comparison to the
results of a media search;
• Read and evaluated reporting guidelines and internal control procedures
at corporate level and in two major Brands regarding the data to be
consolidated in the 2018 Sustainability Report;
• Conducted analytical review of the data and trend explanations submitted
by all Brands and Business Units to A.P. Moller - Maersk Accounting &
Controlling for consolidation;
• Evaluated internal and external documentation to determine whether
information in the 2018 Sustainability Report is supported by sufficient evidence.
Management’s responsibilities
Management of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S is responsible for:
• Designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information
relevant to the preparation of data and information in the Sustainability Report
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
• Establishing objective accounting principles for preparing data and information; • Measuring and reporting data and information in the Sustainability Report
based on the accounting principles; and
• The content of 2018 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report.
Our responsibility
We are responsible for:
• Planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about
whether data and information in the 2018 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability
Report are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; • Forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have
performed and the evidence we have obtained; and

INTRODUCTION
The CMA CGM Group, founded by Jacques R. Saadé, is a global leader in maritime transport and logistics. For over 40 years, the Group’s strong human and entrepreneurial values of boldness, initiative, integrity and imagination have shaped its growth.
Currently headed by Rodolphe Saadé, CMA CGM has steadily grown and is constantly innovating to offer customers increasingly efficient and sustainable services. CMA CGM boasts a fleet of over 500 vessels, operating between 400 ports and with 750 warehouses worldwide. In 2019, it transported more than 20 million containers.
Our leading position stems from the service quality we deliver to customers daily.
In 2019, we amplified service digitalisation to offer new innovative services tailored to customer requirements. The Group’s business has diversified to encompass land transport and logistics. In 2019, two-thirds of container land transport was via train or barge. The acquisition of CEVA Logistics has consolidated our position as an integrated operator offering increasing door-to-door solutions for our customers.
The CMA CGM Group is firmly committed to the energy transition and to becoming a leader in low carbon transport and logistics.
Improving our environmental footprint and that of our customers is at the heart of our strategy. We have opted for liquefied natural gas (LNG) to power our new vessels, aiming beyond regulatory requirements on atmospheric pollution and significantly reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.
We were the first to successfully test second-generation biofuels produced from waste cooking oil, which emit 85% less carbon dioxide than traditional fuel. We will be pioneers in developing this offer on an industrial scale for our customers.
These innovations reflect our philosophy: act now using the best technical solutions available, and actively prepare for the future.
  Rodolphe Saadé
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of the CMA CGM Group
  CSR Report 2019 –CMA CGM Group

The Group’s success is driven by the energy and commitment of over 35,800 employees worldwide.
We are committed to promoting positive human development.
The CMA CGM Group actively promotes the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. We have joined the UN Global Compact and strive to improve corporate practices in this area.
Every year, we bolster our initiatives to uphold and enforce human rights, ethics and compliance, and to combat corruption and enhance supply chain management through an ambitious sustainable procurement policy.
The Group has a culture of continuous improvement. We assess our corporate social responsibility performance on an ongoing basis through various mechanisms. In 2019, the sustainability rating firm EcoVadis awarded CMA CGM Gold status for the fifth consecutive year, highlighting significant progress at various levels, in particular upholding human rights and sustainable procurement.
Diversity is our strength.
The CMA CGM Group is a mosaic of skills and identities, forming a working community where everyone finds meaning in what they do, and is committed both to the common good and personal development.
Our employees represent 148 nationalities. They bring broad perspectives, which enhance our understanding of the world.
Alongside cultural diversity, gender equality is one of our core values. The proportion of women managers is steadily rising. We are driving this change through programmes such as “We are shipping”.
As our employees are our most precious asset, we invest tremendously in talent management and provided more than 260,000 hours of training in 2019.
The scope of this Corporate Social Responsibility Report is the CMA CGM Group excluding CEVA Logistics, which was acquired by the Group in 2019. The process of integrating CEVA Logistics data into the business model, non-financial risk map and CSR reporting is underway. Consolidated data will be finalised in 2020 and will be disclosed in the 2020 CSR Report.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a blueprint for action for businesses which, like CMA CGM, strive to act responsibly and control the impact of their activity on the economy, the environment, people and society.
The 17 universal goals include respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, reduction of inequalities and protection of the environment.
In 2018, CMA CGM established a CSR approach in line with the 17 SDGs to assess its position in relation to the UN programme. The results of this assessment are presented in the introduction of each part of this document.
At the UN Climate Change Conference COP 25, CMA CGM joined the Global Compact, the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative bringing together more than 13,000 participants across 170 countries. The aim of the Global Compact is to mobilise companies and other stakeholders to take concrete measures towards achieving sustainable development goals.
The Global Compact provides a simple, voluntary system for participants to commit to ten principles on human rights, international labour standards, the environment and the combat against corruption.
The Group has also joined the Sustainable Ocean Business Action Platform, which promotes sustainable ocean development goals and is signatory of the nine Sustainable Ocean Principles on protecting and restoring the health of the ocean.
  In 2019, once the CSR risks had been assessed and compared with the CSR challenges, the priority SDGs for the Group were identified.
                    While its business does not directly contribute to achieving these goals, CMA CGM actively promotes them.
CMA CGM’s business activities actively and positively contribute to achieving these
Given its business activities, these goals are strategic for CMA CGM.

Group CSR materiality matrix
The materiality analysis1 was updated in order to rank the Group’s 12 CSR challenges. The graph below shows the order of priority established:
 The vertical axis shows the importance of strategies
established by the Group and its subsidiaries for each challenge;
 The horizontal axis shows the perspective of stakeholders.
 In 2019, 95 employees from the Group and its subsidiaries were surveyed on their views of CMA CGM’s CSR approach.
The Group’s CSR strategies and challenges are based on the full list of CSR criteria set out in Article 225 of the French law on environmental protection Grenelle II.
   1 The methodology used to create the materiality matrix is presented in the Methodological Note herein.

Joint actions and discussions with stakeholders
Recognising that the CSR approach is an evolving issue, the Group participates in discussions to share views and best practice through:
● Inter-company and multi-organisational working groups;
● Conferences;
● Involvement and heading initiatives with other companies and economic stakeholders on positive action;
● Including customers and suppliers in CMA CGM’s CSR approach.

The Group’s CSR risk map
With support from the Risk Management department, a
CSR risk map was created in line with the materiality matrix. Work in 2019 involved: 
 
- -
First, identifying existing risk maps associated with each of the 12 CSR challenges and positioning each of these risks in a “CSR” risk map
Second, comparing the challenges of the materiality  matrix with the risks of the CSR risk map. This enabled  us to determine: 
Challenges with no associated risks. Analyses of  missing risks are currently being conducted;  Whether the position of each risk was similar to  or differed from the challenges. Any differences  were identified and explained. 
Risk of non-compliance with “ethics and compliance” regulations, particularly regarding: competition, corruption, economic sanctions and personal data protection
Partnerships with our suppliers and subcontractors Human rights
Working conditions
Health & safety
Security
Climate change
Scarcity of raw materials and waste production Pollution
 Harm to biodiversity
Managing risk and mapping Group risk
Risk management is handled by the Corporate Risk Management and Internal Audit Department. The Risk Management team implements a corporate-level approach under the impetus of the Executive Board, with input from the various business lines.
The methodology is based on a qualitative assessment at a point in time projected over a year.
The Group risk map and risk maps per business line/function are based on two criteria: ● Probability of occurrence
● Severity of impact
To date, the following CSR-related risks have been identified:

 CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 28

Steering CSR performance
The Sustainability Department reports to the Executive Board and is tasked with:
● Implementing CSR policy in line with all of the Group’s policies
● Identifying stakeholders’ CSR issues, priorities and requirements
● Setting CSR goals and coordinating action plans
● Assessing, measuring and reporting on CSR
performance
At the end of 2019, a Sustainability Committee was created under the impetus of the Executive Board. It regularly convenes members of the Executive Committee to define, adjust and validate progress on the Group’s CSR roadmap. The Sustainability Committee, launched in January 2020, also aims to enhance the Group’s overall strategy as well as broaden and implement customer offers.
In addition, an Operational CSR Committee convenes quarterly to roll out the strategic pillars decided by the Executive Board and Sustainability Committee and implement adequate measures. The committee comprises members from various departments (Human
Resources, Risk Management and Internal Audit, Compliance, Finance, Communication and Marketing, Purchasing, Transformation and Innovation, Security, Safety and the Environment), the network of agencies, the Lines, CMA Ships, the CMA CGM Foundation and the Group’s subsidiaries.
Ad hoc “business line” or “project” committee meetings are held in parallel along with more operational working groups that meet more frequently.
An expanding network of CSR correspondents has also been established, comprising CSR contributors working in support services and the subsidiaries. They are ambassadors of the Group’s CSR approach, advocating and coordinating initiatives and projects.
A CSR dashboard has been set up to measure and steer the Group’s sustainable development performance through a series of quantitative and qualitative indicators that are consolidated on a half-yearly basis. – cf. page 150: Key Performance Indicators
Data completeness and reliability, enhanced from year to year, are guaranteed by indicator fact sheets describing the collection and consolidation scope and processes. An extract is included in the “Methodology” section of this document. – cf. page 156: Methodology
CSR reporting is coordinated by the CSR Department. Data from the “CSR Dashboard” is verified by an Independent Third Party every year. The report issued by the Independent Third Party is appended hereto. – cf. page 163: ITP Report
Analysing changes in these indicators enables the Group to quantify the impact of policies implemented, identify areas for improvement and determine and/or adjust the goals and action plans for the current year and medium term. – cf. page 24: 2019 Goals and Achievements and 2020/2021 Action Plan

The Group’s CSR performance recognised by EcoVadis
In 2019, we maintained our Gold status for the fifth consecutive year, with a substantially higher rating. The sustainability rating firm highlighted two major strengths: a structured, well-
managed CSR approach rolled out into action plans and KPIs and a documented framework of CSR subjects defined in conjunction with human resources
Employee involvement in the Group’s CSR approach
 As CMA CGM views its employees as standard-bearers for its CSR approach, it prepares awareness-raising initiatives directed towards them throughout the year.
CSR month
This year, CMA CGM celebrated World Environment Day (5 June) and World Oceans Day (8 June) with a “CSR Month” instead of the usual “CSR Days”. Throughout the month of June, 11 events including workshops, roundtables, articles on the Group’s intranet, a poster campaign and nine conferences were held addressing various aspects of the Group’s CSR policy. The events took place in the premises of the Tour Jacques Saadé in Marseilles.
Over 750 employees participated.
These include articles in the Group’s in-house e- newspaper, poster campaigns, events and training sessions.

The values of the CMA CGM Group are reflected in its CSR strategy, and are presented by various Group representatives (CSR, Environment, Sustainable Procurement, Ethics and Compliance, Security and the CMA CGM Foundation) over the two days.
The second day deals with business lines at CMA CGM and related tools (containers, vessels, terminals), life at sea, the Captain’s role, and the organisation of lines, and the CMA CGM Group in general.
The purpose of the induction programme is to enable each new head office employee to gain an understanding of the Group as a whole, as well as its various business lines and facets. New employees are taught to see their own role in the wider picture and the impact each person has on the overall success and sustainability of the CMA CGM Group.
In 2019, 322 employees attended integration sessions.
Training on the environment
CMA CGM invests in training courses designed to make environmental protection an integral part of all business activities. Upon joining the Group, all new employees receive safety and environment training for their job so that they can do their work in full compliance with applicable rules. Depending on their job, employees then attend specific training modules for their field (for example, ISO 14001 training for 25 internal auditors this year, but also courses on chemical risks for employees handling chemical products).
Moreover, an environment-related e-learning programme is prepared for all seafarers, depending on their rank and potential impact on the environment. The modules may be followed on board or on land. Special seminars for officers are also routinely organised at the Group’s head office to inform, raise awareness and train them on issues relating to health, safety, security and the environment. The seminars are held twice a year at head office.
The CMA CGM Academy portal features an e-learning module accessible to all employees that lists the key points of the Group’s environmental policy to be presented to customers. This training module lasts 30minutes. It has already been followed by over 4,500 employees.

ENVIRONMENT
2019 Accomplishments
Face In the face of global environmental challenges, the CMA CGM Group is firmly committed to the green transition. We have taken pioneering concrete decisions to reduce the impact of our activities on the climate, air quality and biodiversity.
Our philosophy regarding the environment is reflected in our decisions, such as avoiding Arctic shipping routes, investing massively in liquefied natural gas to fuel our new vessels and testing and using second-generation biofuels from 2020. We are striving to take concrete steps today, activating all levers at our disposal and looking beyond foreseeable technological progress. This philosophy is embodied in our motto: PROUD TO ACT.
 As a corollary to its participation in the United Nations Global Compact (-UNGC) , the Group has joined the Sustainable Ocean Business Action Platform. The multi-stakeholder platform promotes sustainable ocean development goals and best practices.

General Policy
Environmental protection is a central to CMA CGM’s commitment to sustainable, responsible development. Overarching issues for the Group include continuing to shrink the environmental footprint of all maritime and inland operations; regulatory compliance and planning ahead for future regulations; and developing more eco- efficient logistics chains with customers and partners.
Launch of the CMA CGM Jacques Saadé
Alternative fuel – Biofuel
The CMA CGM Group’s environmental policy is built on three strategic concerns:
● Climate change: improving the carbon footprint of
Group activities
● Air quality: reducing atmospheric pollution
● Ecosystems: protecting the oceans and marine
biodiversity
  A world first: the largest LNG-powered container ship in the history of maritime transport was launched in Shanghai on 25 September 2019. Bearing the name of the Group’s founder, the CMA CGM Jacques Saadé is entirely powered by liquefied natural gas and has a capacity of 23,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent unit).
This feat of engineering illustrates CMA CGM’s commitment to the energy transition.
    CMA CGM is adopting marine biofuels at an increasing rate. CMA CGM chose Shell as its supplier of several thousand tonnes of second-generation biofuel derived from used cooking oil.
CMA CGM Group vessels will be able to sail approximately one million kilometres with biofuels. With this choice, the Group reaffirms its role as a pioneer in the use of sustainable, eco-friendly solutions for the energy transition in the shipping and logistics industry.
  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 40

  CMA CGM chooses LNG
 In 2017, Rodolphe Saadé, Chief Executive Officer of the CMA CGM Group, announced that nine vessels with a 23,000 TEUs capacity (twenty-foot equivalent unit) had been ordered, with the decision taken to equip them with LNG motors. These are not only the Group’s largest vessels, but also the first LNG-powered vessels of this size in the world.
With these vessels, CMA CGM is taking action above and beyond environmental regulations. By 2022, CMA CGM will have the largest fleet of LNG container ships:
9 23,000 TEU vessels, 5 15,000 TEU vessels, 6 1,400 TEU vessels, including 3 that are already in operation at Containerships, the Group’s intra-European subsidiary.
With these vessels, CMA CGM is taking action above and beyond environmental regulations.
The IMO’s new Low Sulphur regulation aims to divide bunker fuel sulphur levels by seven. This will reduce sulphur oxide emissions by 85% around the world. CMA CGM will already fully comply with the new regulation in 2020, even surpassing it by investing in LNG technology.
Liquefied natural gas cuts sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions by 99%. It also cuts fine particulates by 99% and nitrogen emissions by 85%. The result is a remarkable improvement in air quality, particularly for coastal communities and port cities.
    CMA CGM decides not to use the Northern Sea Route
 A forward-thinking choice for biodiversity protection in the Arctic and more generally planet-wide.
The Northern Sea Route, a channel between Asia and Europe that follows the polar coasts of Russia, has become navigable due to glacial melting from global warming. Teeming with unique biodiversity that is only partially understood, the Arctic plays a crucial role in regulating currents and the global climate. Massive use of the sea route would pose real danger to the outstanding natural ecosystems of this part of the globe due to the risk of accidents, oil pollution, and ship strikes to dolphins and whales.
To avoid endangering this fragile environment even further, Rodolphe Saadé has decided that none of CMA CGM Group’s 500 vessels will take the Northern Sea Route.
With this decision, CMA CGM takes a definite stand to protect the environment and global biodiversity despite the competitive advantage that this route would represent for maritime companies.
 CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 41

1. Energy transition
Energy consumption has always been a core concern give the very nature of the Group’s business. The fight against climate change leads to greater technical, regulatory, financial and operating constraints, with significant impact on activities that still rely heavily on fossil fuels. This backdrop also creates new opportunities for sustainable, fair shipping. The CMA CGM Group is striving to become a leader on these new markets.
The transition to more efficient, carbon-free energy solutions is of interest to the economy, the environment and public health. On a day-to-day basis, it involves several Group entities.
Energy consumption
● In 2018, the Group introduced a programme to install recovery boilers for auxiliary engines (as for the main engine). Instead of burning oil to produce the necessary steam, the boilers recover heat from the auxiliary engine exhaust gases, even when the main engine is shut down. This technology has been installed on 21 vessels.
Fleet Navigation Centers anticipate extreme weather events and advise captains in choosing a route to minimise fuel consumption of our vessels. Three Fleet Navigation Centres covering all time zones are manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week by seagoing personnel assigned to the shore-based facilities. Moreover, a Group operations department has been set up to optimise all Group operations (maritime and operational management of ships, reduce port congestion, optimal use of the CMA CGM sea and land network).
Combatting climate change
a. Managinggreenhousegasemissions
According to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), carbon dioxide emissions from shipping account for 2.2% of total global emissions.
During the 72nd Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) held in April 2018, the IMO entered into an agreement for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions associated with the shipping industry, thereby getting the industry on board in the fight against climate change.
The agreement set a goal of halving carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 compared to 2008 levels and cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 40% per container by 2030 and 70% by 2050. It also sets forth more stringent standards for new ships.
With these challenges in mind, the CMA CGM Group has set an ambitious new goal of 30% less carbon dioxide per loaded container by 2025. This is after already improving its carbon emissions per container and per kilometre by 50% between 2005 and 2015. The Group has already reduced its carbon emissions per loaded container by 24% since 2015.
In 2015 the European Parliament passed the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) regulation that requires companies to report carbon dioxide emissions of vessels sailing out of, towards and within the European Union.

     In 2019, fuel consumption for the CMA CGM Group’s maritime activity was 7,782 thousand tonnes, i.e. 6% lower than in 2018. With regard to energy efficiency, we reported a net improvement in the amount of fuel per loaded container, which was 9% lower than in 2018.
For many years now, the Group has conducted several initiatives to reduce fuel consumption. These include replacing the fleet, monitoring consumption, reducing speed, optimising routes and improving propulsion and hydrodynamic technology.
● In 2013 CMA CGM launched a programme to optimise its owned fleet primarily by modifying its bulbous bows. These changes were done in dry dock and help to maximise the ship’s hydrodynamics at the speeds used in our company. Some 64 ships have been modified, in addition to new builds. This innovation can cut fuel use and carbon dioxide emissions by 5-10%.
Additionally, there is a programme to switch out old propellers for energy-efficient ones. In 2019, 20 propellers were changed.
● Another example of efforts to reduce energy consumption is CMA SHIPS’ limiting the capacities of the main engines of its largest vessels to adapt to current navigation speeds.

Reporting started in 2018, and each carrier has submitted the report of its carbon dioxide emissions to the European Union. The Group has developed a reporting tool to ensure compliance, along with the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS). The first year of reporting went smoothly, and the data filed complied with requirements.
CDP’s assessment – Carbon Disclosure Project – an international non-profit organization managing the most important environmental reporting platform dedicated to cities and companies. With a B assessment, CMA CGM progresses one more time and obtains a mark higher than its business sector’s average one in 2019.
Alongside the European system, the IMO’s international reporting system for carbon dioxide emissions, known as the IMO DCS (Data Collection System), took effect in January 2019. The Group has developed a tool specifically for the IMO DCS, complementing the MRV tool.

b. Overall assessment of the Group’s carbon dioxide emissions
For the CMA CGM Group, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions is the combustion of fuel, which represents more than 83% of the Group’s total energy use. The energy consumption of shore activities (mainly electricity at the agencies and terminals) is insignificant in comparison with the consumption of the shipping fleet. The main indirect sources of carbon dioxide emissions for the Group are shipbuilding and fuel use in ships. In 2019, scope 3 represented approximately 16.5% of the Group’s carbon dioxide emissions.
● Scope 1 includes emissions from the consumption of fuel by the owned and chartered vessels as well as the fuel consumed at the terminals by materials handling machinery
● Scope 2 includes emissions from the consumption of electricity at the terminals, regional offices and head office, and shore-to-ship power
● Scope 3 emissions stem from ship- and container- building, on-board waste (solid and liquid), employee business travel, the consumption of fuel oil specific to inland transport, and upstream bunker fuel production and transport

Through the Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG), a discussion and collaboration platform, maritime shippers and major shipping customers are helping develop methods to calculate air emissions in
their industry. The working group represents no less than 80% of container shipping capacity. CMA CGM has been an active member since 2003.
Based on CCWG methodology, and to meet regulatory requirements and customer requirements, in 2008, CMA CGM set up a monitoring system for its carbon dioxide emissions and performance (in g/TEU-km) which is audited by an independent accredited organisation. The CMA CGM Group (through its subsidiary APL) is a member of the CCWG executive committee.
In November, the CMA CGM Group received the prize for the “Most accomplished Asia Pacific Ship Owner of the Year” at the Maritime 2020 conference in Singapore. The prize is bestowed upon the ship owner that has demonstrated the most efforts in making its
The IMO’s decisions to limit the sulphur content of ship fuel as of 1 January 2020 to 0.5%, and the ambitious strategy recently adopted to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, have focused the industry’s attention on finding alternative solutions to conventional fuel.
In light of these challenges, energy transition is a major issue for the shipping industry as a whole and the CMA CGM Group in particular. The main challenges associated with alternative fuels lie in the compatibility of their environmental benefits as regards pollution, availability of the quantities required by the industry, and cost.
The most promising solutions are LNG, biofuels and hydrogen. Fuel cells, batteries and wind power have their advantages, but must be considered as secondary or back-up sources.
The liquefied natural gas
The Group has made LNG its fuel of choice. LNG has many environmental advantages compared with heavy fuel oil, such as significantly lower carbon dioxide emissions, the absence of sulphur oxide (SOx) and the drastic reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) and fine particulates. As a true technological breakthrough in environmental protection, compared with current fuels LNG:
● Produces up to 20% less carbon dioxide
● Cuts sulphur emissions by 99%
● Cuts fine particulate emissions by 99%
● Produces 85% less nitrogen oxide
LNG-powered vessels will therefore not only comply with, but considerably surpass, the IMO regulation aimed at reducing sulphur emissions starting in 2020.

The 2nd generation biofuels
In 2019, CMA CGM performed tests with second- generation biofuels, in partnership with IKEA.
In the ground-breaking test, sustainable biofuel was blended with conventional marine fossil fuel to power a vessel on a major ocean route. The biofuel is second generation and derived from used cooking oil. It therefore does not compete with agriculturally-derived, edible oils, and has no negative environmental impacts, unlike the first-generation biofuels that caused soil contamination, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity.
Both tests bunkering with biofuel had a positive outcome, proving that sustainable marine biofuels are technically compatible. These developments show that biofuels are a viable choice to comply with current and future environmental regulations and meet objectives for cutting harmful emissions.
Sustainable marine biofuels are virtually free of sulphur oxide – SOx and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80- 90% compared with equivalent fossil fuels. The GHG reduction of each biofuel is certified independently by the International Sustainability Carbon Certification (ISCC) system. Discussions are underway with our suppliers to audit the ISCC certification process.
Concurrently, hydrogen and kite propulsion systems are being studied since the Group’s experts are convinced that energy transition challenges will be best met with a mix of technologies.
Xavier Leclercq
Vice Président – CMA Ships, CMA CGM Group
"Improved hydrodynamics, route optimisation, alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas and second- generation biofuels, we are using all the levers currently available to improve the environmental performance of our fleet. At the same time, we are actively preparing for the future by developing solutions through R&D, such as sail assistance and hydrogen power, which will enable us to further reduce our ships' emissions.”

Combatting air pollution
In addition to carbon dioxide, the Group is concerned about sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxide emissions and fine particulates. Since these emissions threaten public health and air quality, they are governed by ever more stringent international and local regulations.
a. GlobalSulphurCap2020
In October 2016, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) set a 0.5% cap on sulphur in fuel oil effective from 1 January 2020. The cap will cut the quantity of sulphur oxide from vessels by 85% and should significantly improve air quality, particularly for those living in port cities and coastal communities. The IMO regulation springs from Annex VI of the MARPOL Protocol on the prevention of air pollution from ships.
The Group has set up a dedicated working group (Countdown 2020 Work Group) that brings together representatives from many departments at the head office (Bunkering,
special waste and ensure it is handled following the highest environmental standards, the Group performs audits to select waste transporters and available effluent treatment plants.
In 2019, the average sulphur content in fuel oil purchased by the Group was 2.1%.
b. Shore-to-ship power
In California, since 2014 local regulations have required shipping companies to connect to and use shore power, instead of auxiliary engines. The percentage of
fleet calls required to use shore power was increased from the initial 50% to 70% in 2017, thereby reducing fuel consumption and related air emissions by an additional 20%. To ensure regulatory compliance of our vessels and calls, thirty CMA CGM ships were equipped with alternative maritime power systems.
Starting on 1 January 2020, the percentage of required shore power connections increased to 80%. The Operations and Chartering Departments, along with our subsidiary that manages owned vessels, are involved to ensure the compliance of the fleet deployed in California. Our vessels fitted with this technology connect to the shore in China on a voluntary basis in suitably equipped ports.
The technology has prevented the emission of some 20,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, 10 tonnes of sulphur oxide, 355 tonnes of nitrogen oxide and 24 tonnes of PM10.

c. Emission Control Areas
Emission Control Areas
 There are currently three large areas where sulphur emissions from ships are regulated: Northern Europe, North America and, since 2018, China.
In 2016 China established Emission Control Areas (ECA) in its territorial waters in order to handle the persistent problem of air pollution. The environmental programme entered an additional phase on 1 January 2019, under which all vessels entering the Emission Control Areas are required to use fuel oil with a maximum sulphur content of 0.5%.
d. Sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions
All of the Group’s vessels comply with the Chinese requirements. The necessary bunker purchases were planned in advance to guarantee full compliance when the new requirements entered into force.

Customer solutions
Customer services pertaining to carbon
Shipping customers increasingly seek environmental information on the services they buy. Customers request environmental and other CSR information on approximately 20% of total cargo carried. The growing emphasis on the carbon footprint in the choice of shipper explains the Group’s efforts to offer more and more premium customers tailored services focusing on their various impacts.
The trend can be seen in the growing number of shipping customers joining the Clean Cargo Working Group. The autumn 2019 session boasted more than 18 new members, including Amazon, Levi’s, Primark and Shark. For the first time in the history of the working group, the number of shipping customers exceeded the number of shippers.
The Customer Agency Network and CSR Department are working together to enable the Group to expand its portfolio of sustainable services.
To guarantee customers highly reliable environmental data, the methodology used for all carbon data disclosures is audited and certified by KPMG as an independent third party.
Carbon optimization studies
Transporting cargo on container ships creates a lower tonne-kilometre carbon footprint than other modes of transport.
To seize on this, the Environment department provides the Group’s business lines with technical support so they can highlight the value of the new maritime services on offer. The purpose is to quantify the excellence of our environmental performance compared to other competing sea or inland solutions. For example, a study was carried out to encourage the shift from road transport to the Morocco Shuttle for the refrigerated transport of cherry tomatoes between Agadir and Dakhla
    The most frequent customer questions in 2019 dealt with the carbon footprint of their freight shipped with CMA CGM. Already in 2011, the Group developed its "Eco Calculator” in reply to these requests, to estimate the carbon footprint of maritime shipments port-to-port. The Eco Calculator is available on our website and on the websites of our subsidiaries under their own brands.
Since 2013, in compliance with French regulations, all Group customers logged on to our e-commerce platform have automatically received a calculation of the carbon footprint of each booking, both maritime and shore-side.
My Carbon Reporting
The Group also provides a service, entering its fourth consecutive year, of carbon footprint reports for all bookings of a given customer.
In 2019, 113 Group customers (compared to 85 in 2018) were chosen for the service based on their shipment volumes and environmental implications. They received an analysis breaking down their door-to-door carbon emissions by trade and by transport mode.
In addition to shipping and port operations, the CMA CGM Group designs and implements multi-modal logistics solutions. These pre- and post-shipment solutions enable the Group to offer customers comprehensive transport solutions that are also environmentally-friendly.

joint impact on the environment. An example is the identification of “green corridors”. The partners also undertake to actively seek out synergies and opportunities for practical, positive community action wherever they are established.
Two new sustainability pacts were signed in 2019, with international freight forwarders Kuehne Nagel and Bolloré Logistics. As for shipping customers, Perrier and Inditex have taken their stand for sustainability alongside the Group.
Sustainability pacts hinge on four main concerns: the environment (both partners have official carbon reduction goals for 2025 and systematically seek out any joint opportunity for timely achievement of these goals); social policy within both groups; observance of an official Code of Ethics; and active examination of the company’s role within the broader community.
Qualification IWAY
The CMA CGM Group has ben IWAY-certified since 2009. In July 2018, the certification was successfully renewed with no failings noted by the auditor, who expressed his « great satisfaction as to the quality, transparency and expertise of the various persons involved in the process ». In the coming years, IKEA’s expectations will focus on developing business projects involving intermodal transport, marine bioenergy, and compliance with Sulphur Cap 2020.

2. Biodiversity protection
Spills and containers lost at sea
Spills, particularly oil spills from Group vessels or terminals, are our greatest environmental risk. A set of measures is in place to mitigate this risk, such as fleet maintenance, routine drills and simulations both on- board and on-shore, and a strong crisis management policy.
There are several types of marine pollution:
● Fuel oil
● Oil
● Chemicals
● Sludge
These types of pollution are prevented with on-board equipment, human management, and the entire set of operational and inspection procedures in place.
First, the vessels are equipped with Ship Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (SOPEP) materials such as dispersants, rags, saw dust, protective goggles, shovels, buckets, portable pumps, absorbent pads, gloves and bags.
Spill severity scale
Liquid waste is managed with instruments that comply with regulations. For example, an oily water separator is used to control the maximum oil content of effluent discharged at sea from a vessel en route, i.e. 15 parts per million. The separator on some ships can even achieve a mere 5 parts per million. Human management and procedures play a crucial role in pollution prevention.
The teams have entered into partnerships with:
● The Marseilles naval fire brigade Bataillon des Marins Pompiers: fire and oil spill drills are organised on
board in a continuous improvement approach.
● The French centre for documentation, research and experimentation on accidental water spills Le Cèdre (Centre de documentation, de recherche et d'expérimentations sur les pollutions accidentelles des eaux). CMA CGM personnel are trained every
year at this centre based in Brest, Brittany.
● Specific organisations, such as ECM, act as the point of contact between the Group and the United States

According to the World Shipping Council14, 2,000 containers were lost at sea worldwide every year from 2006 to 2013 primarily due to difficult navigation conditions or rare incidents. In 2019, the CMA CGM Group lost only one empty container. – see table on page 149: Number of major maritime events
When containers are lost at sea, it is generally due to the shipping customer declaring a lower weight of the container. Poor weather increases the risk. Every effort is made to prevent losing containers: weather watch, fleet navigation centres, weather routing, and an on-board container security system. The CMA CGM Group began talks with the French ship-owners’ association Armateurs de France and the relevant authorities to further reduce the risk of losing containers at sea. – see page 128: Cargo Security
Charte Bleue – Armateurs de France is a Charter that seeks to ensure safety at sea and promote respect for the environment. It covers pollution prevention and management, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and efficient waste management
Protecting ecosystems
Biodiversity protection overwhelmingly involves risk management pertaining to liquid or solid discharge at sea. However, container ships also have a potential impact on biodiversity due to their negative impact on marine species.
a. Ballastwatertreatmentsystem
Ballasts are tanks filled with sea water located on both sides of a vessel that ensure stability and structural integrity. Ballast water contains living species that can disrupt local fauna and flora when discharged.
The IMO’s convention on ballast water management was adopted in February 2004, ratified in 2016 and entered into force on 8 September 2017.
CMA CGM prepared for the entry into force of the convention by installing ballast water treatment systems on most new vessels, thereby ensuring that ballast water
14 Survey Results for Containers Lost At Sea – 2014 Update- World Shipping Council
CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group
discharged at sea is fully free of any species that could affect marine biodiversity.
The United States has also implemented local regulations on the treatment of ballast water. The country approved 25 ballast water treatment systems that comply with its own regulations, which are more stringent than international regulations. CMA CGM vessels are equipped with approved systems and must treat their ballast water via one of these systems before discharging them into American waters.
The Group has set up a schedule for installing the systems on its owned fleet, in accordance with the requirements of the international convention and American regulations. To date 99 vessels of the Group have been equipped.
b. Inspectiondescoquespardronesous- marin : projet pilote avec Notilo Plus
CMA SHIPS is going to start using ten underwater drones for hull inspections.
The project came to fruition after several months of collaboration with Notilo Plus, which developed the drone and a digital monitoring platform with customised algorithms. The drones:
● Improve hydrodynamic performance
● Monitor hull deterioration better
● Guarantee the seaworthiness of ships in areas of risk. Preliminary testing is underway in Marseilles, on the CAP CAMARAT. Notilo Plus was the first start-up to win the Jacques Saadé Prize at the Trophées de l'Economie in 2018. It benefited from business acceleration support at ZEBOX, the business incubator and accelerator founded by CMA CGM.

c. Othereco-technologies:FORS,double hulls, additional tanks for bilge water
In addition to the ballast water treatment system, the owned fleet features many technologies that limit its impact on biodiversity.
The Fast Oil Recovery System (FORS) is a simple, reliable and safe system for managing oil spills. As its name implies, if a vessel is grounded FORS makes it possible to quickly recover bunker oil through a system of standardised connectors. The technology has been installed on 57 vessels.
Up until 2010, the fuel oil tanks of container ships were generally single hulled. Since the MARPOL 12A rule took effect (circa 2010), they have been double hulled. A double hull on fuel tanks prevents oil spills in the event of collision or piercing of the ship’s hull.
Additional tanks installed on our newly built ships make it possible to treat bilge water and greywater more effectively.
a. Cetaceans and marine mammals
Several programmes are in place in the United States and Canada to protect cetaceans (whales, dolphins, narwhals, etc.). On the eastern coast, CMA CGM ships must reduce their speed to 10 knots at most in certain areas recognised as cetacean breeding sites.
On the western coast, CMA CGM has voluntarily committed to the “Green Flag” speed reduction programme that was established in the sanctuary close to the Santa Barbara islands.
Between 1 May and 15 November 2019, CMA CGM took part in a voluntary campaign to reduce the speed of ships, which was organised by the NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS).
The port of Long Beach recognised CMA CGM for its almost 100% compliance in lowering the speed of its container ships.
Elsewhere, the Group uses the Fleet Navigation Center to watch out for areas where it is recommended to lower the speed of vessels. The Group endeavours to slow down vessels at the earliest opportunity to limit the risk of ship strikes in these sanctuaries. – see page 122: Fleet Navigation Centre: state-of-the-art technological resources
In the Pelagos and Agoa sanctuaries, French vessels are equipped with a new tool, REPCET®. The on-board computer system allows the community of subscribers to report, share and receive cetacean positions in real time. Springing from 10 years of joint effort between shipping companies, environmental stakeholders and engineers, REPCET® is the first on-board computer system for
monitoring whale positions. Its aim is to limit the risk of ship strikes, one of the leading causes of accidental death of large cetaceans.
d. Endangered species
To limit the transport of endangered species, the Group has set up procedures during the order process so staff can report this type of cargo. – see page 128: Cargo Security

Voluntary environmental initiatives
CMA SHIPS’s ISO 14001 certification has been renewed until 2022, after the 2019 audits found no major form of non- compliance. The absence of major failings confirmed the maturity of our management, environmental, quality and safety system.
The CMA CGM Group is an active member of diverse environmental programmes focused on ocean preservation, animal protection and air quality.
Below are some of the highlights of 2019:
  ESI Focus – Environmental Shipping Index
WPCI – World Port Climate Initiative is an initiative launched by the major ports of the world, which pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions through the ESI - Environmental Ship Index. The ESI is a platform for collecting and noting environmental information from registered vessels, in particular concerning greenhouse gases and atmospheric pollutants. Based on quarterly updated data, the ports “reward” the best performing vessels. Note that the ports of Longbeach (Green Flag Incentive Program), New York (Clean Vessels Incentive Program) and Vancouver (Blue Circle), rely on the ESI rating to reward the most
performing according to their own local programs
      CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 54

● The CMA CGM Group received accolades from ISO 14001 in Spain, the Green Flag programme in California, the Clean Vessels Incentive in New York and the Blue Circle in Vancouver
● Environmental Ship Index (ESI). The group has been taking part in this initiative for several years in 16 ports in Europe, the United States and in Asia. In 2019, two new agreements were signed: with the port of Dunkirk and the Port Authority of New South Wales (Sydney Harbour and Port Botany in Australia).
3. Resources, raw materials and waste
The circular economy is an economic concept in sustainable development that sets forth the objective of producing goods and services with minimal use and waste of raw materials, water and energy. As a shipping and logistics operator, CMA CGM is an active player in the circular economy due to its involvement at all phases of transporting raw materials, semi-finished and finished consumer goods and end-of-life products, depending on the needs of its customers. The Group pays special attention to the responsible use of resources, raw materials and consumables.

     A variety of waste is produced by the owned fleet:
● Solid waste including food scraps and general

● Liquid waste from sewage, oily water and sludge.
a. Solidwaste
The Group has committed to an innovative, exemplary green approach to exceed the requirements of the MARPOL Protocol: the “Green Ship” Programme. All the Group’s owned vessels, numbering 164, now take part in the programme.
The initiative is structured around four key aspects: Sorting all waste

CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group
In 2019, an average of 10 cubic metres of solid waste per ship was generated each month.
The programme also lets vessels share “good practices” or “issues encountered”. For example, there is a directory of ports that collect waste for recovery, broken down by type of waste (ink cartridges, plastics, etc.); conversely other ports are not recommended. The goal is to draw up a shared map of ports where waste sorting is taken the most seriously.
The programme also makes it possible to set up waste treatment systems. This year, a map of companies equipped to handle asbestos-containing waste was sent to seafarers so this type of waste can be handled with the best available techniques.
b. Liquid waste
Liquid waste primarily arises from the use of fuel oil (bunker fuel). Vessels run on “residual” fuel oil that contains water and heavy metals. To be combustible, it has to be purified on board. Centrifugal purifiers dilute the water and heavy metals that are separated from the fuel oil. All this waste creates “sludge” which is considered hazardous waste. It is offloaded ashore and directed to land-based waste streams. CMA CGM takes care of the
   55

sludge generated by the owned fleet, but for chartered vessels, sludge disposal depends on the charter party. It may be managed by the ship owner or the charterer.
A special team was put together in June 2015 to monitor sludge discharge. It refined the method for assessing the quantity of sludge produced. In 2019, the ratio of sludge to bunker fuel consumed was defined as 2.36%.
Sludge production –
In thousands of 190 183 -3% tonnes
The waste production of the CMA CGM Group’s offices and branches is comparable to standard office activities. The waste generated at dry ports and terminals mainly involves non-hazardous waste (e.g. pallets, wood, shrink wrap) and accounts for less than 1,200 cubic metres per year within the Group’s scope of consolidation (Finance).
Ship dismantling
Considering current dismantling practices and shipbuilding materials, the end of life of ships is potentially a major issue for the industry. Pending the ratification of the Hong Kong international convention, in 2008, the Group began establishing inventories of hazardous materials (IHM) on board, which will eventually be compulsory. The Group has proactively undertaken a vast plan to install or update the IHM for the entire owned fleet. The Group is continuing its regulatory and technical watch, as well as research with dismantling sites in Europe and Asia. The sites are audited in accordance with the guidelines of the Hong Kong Convention. It should be noted that the Group’s fleet is one of the youngest in the industry and the vessels are usually sold before their end of life.
Nevertheless, whenever a vessel must be sent for dismantling, the group takes measures to send it to a dismantling site that complies with local and international health, safety and environmental standards.
First, the Group uses the BIMCO model contract on safe, ecological ship recycling to anticipate and control all steps through to complete recycling of the ship.
A basic groundwork has been defined to bolster our strategy and limit environmental and safety risks:
● Primary cutting prohibited in the intertidal zone
● Cutting performed in an impermeable area
CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group
● Safety/security and environmental procedures in place at the dismantling site
● Specific procedures on hazardous waste management, including temporary storage at the dismantling site
In 2019, three Group vessels were sent for dismantling to an internationally-certified site:
● APL JAPAN, 24 years old
● APL KOREA, 22 years old
● APL SINGAPORE, 24 years old
The Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative (-SRTI)
is a platform for reporting information on ship recycling against a set of predefined disclosure criteria developed jointly by key stakeholders of the maritime industry.

Water consumption at the
terminals
Water consumption is not a significant issue for the CMA CGM Group’s maritime transport activity. Actually, water consumption on ships is neutral since sea water is pumped in, desalinated and treated for everyday use on board.
For the terminals, water consumption mainly stems from washing materials handling vehicles, quays and containers. Most of the sites are located close to other port industries that produce a lot of dust, thereby requiring frequent washing of the working environments. In 2019, within the Group’s scope of consolidation, total water consumption amounted to 516,944 cubic metres.

Low-energy reefers:
Short for refrigerated containers, reefers are specially designed to ship foodstuffs and perishables, so they require energy and refrigerant gases. Low- energy reefers have a
more efficient motor that cuts electricity costs and refrigerant use by up to a third. At present, 74% of the reefer fleet used by the Group (owned and leased) is comprised of low-energy reefers.

Code of Ethics: CMA CGM Group's foundation document
The Code of Ethics is the cornerstone of CMA CMA’s commitment to maintain the highest standards of business ethics, personal integrity and compliance in all of its business activities.
The Code of Ethics applies worldwide to all subsidiaries, affiliates, partnerships, joint ventures and other business arrangements directly or indirectly controlled by CMA CGM, as well as all CMA CGM Group employees, regardless of their status or geographic location.
.
Its main principles are included in CMA CGM’s Third Party Code of Conduct applicable to all Group’s partners.

● La Introducing an Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct, an integral part of the Rules of Procedure for companies established in France, while concurrently updating the Code of Ethics. The Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct incorporates applicable anti- corruption and influence peddling rules and disciplinary sanctions in the event of breach.
● Generalising a whistleblowing platform (Ethics Hotline) to enable employees and third parties to report the existence of conduct or situations contrary to the Group’s Code of Ethics.
● Performing risk mapping under the responsibility of the Group’s Risk Management Department to identify, assess, rank and manage the corruption risks to which the Group is exposed.
● It also serves to provide Management and those in charge of Compliance with the information needed to implement measures for detecting and preventing corruption risk in line with identified challenges.
● Strengthening and updating procedures (due diligence) to assess compliance of CMA CGM’s partners, intermediaries, suppliers and customers.
● Introducing internal and external accounting control procedures to ensure that ledgers, registers and financial statements are not used to conceal acts of corruption or influence peddling.
● Updating a classroom-based and e-learning training system for the Group’s executives and other employees most exposed to the risks of corruption and influence peddling.
● Having the Internal Audit Department perform an assessment of the anti-corruption compliance system.

Les Group compliance policies
In 2019, the CMA CGM Group established and revised various business ethics and integrity policies, as part of its global compliance programme in application of the French Sapin II law.
The Code of Ethics, as mentioned in the introduction, applies to the entire CMA CGM Group.
The Third-Party Code of Conduct applies to all “business partners”, individuals or organisations that do business with CMA CGM, including suppliers, intermediaries, dealers, distributors, subcontractors, consultants and joint ventures. All our business partners are required to
adhere to and stringently apply our Third-Party Code of Conduct and any other equivalent rules.
The Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct is included in the Rules of Procedure of all CMA CGM Group entities located in France.
The Gifts and Hospitality Policy describes
acceptable and prohibited behaviours for
CMA CGM employees.
Whenever they are not reasonable, gifts,
meals, travel, accommodation, marketing
and recreational events may be considered
bribes. As a result, all CMA CGM Group employees must display honesty and transparency in these areas, so that their behaviour may in no way be construed as the acceptance or offering of a bribe.
The Conflicts of Interest Policy requires all “key people”, a list of whom is included in the appendix, to sign an annual conflict of interest disclosure statement. All other CMA CGM Group employees must report any potential risk of conflict of interest they encounter. Conflicts of interest must be reported using the Ethics Hotline. However, an alternative procedure is available for employees who do not have access to the Internet.
The Interest Representatives Policy, applicable since January 2019, defines the applicable rules of ethics and conduct and lays down a “due diligence” procedure before CMA CGM hires any interest representative.
The CMA CGM Group has also developed a compliance “due diligence” procedure applicable to
third parties with whom CMA CGM
intends to develop a business relationship.
Given the sectors in which it operates,
CMA CGM has business relationships with
numerous third parties (customers,
suppliers, subcontractors, intermediaries, brokers, co- investors, etc.). By exercising vigilance regarding the integrity of the third parties with which it does business, the Group enforces its anti-corruption policy.

Group compliance within the maritime industry
Since March 2014, the Group has been a member of the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN), which combats corruption in the port and shipping industry. The MACN is a global business network working towards a maritime industry free of corruption, which promotes fair trade for the benefit of society at large.
In 2019, the network had over 120 members from the maritime industry. The BSR, a non- governmental organisation, provides the Secretariat function for MACN from Copenhagen. Its responsibility is to advance MACN’s initiatives and prepare various tools, communication or otherwise, for use by its members.

Requires compliance with European and US regulations
As a leading French player in maritime container shipping and logistics, the CMA CGM Group must comply with regulations regarding economic sanctions.
A dedicated team within the Legal Department helps enforce CMA CGM’s security and compliance approach alongside employee awareness-raising initiatives on economic sanctions issues.
3. Competition
The CMA CGM Group has made employees’ knowledge of and compliance with competition law one of its top priorities. Following the 2008 maritime conferences in Europe, the Group set up a competition compliance programme. Its aim is to ensure that all Group entities and business lines in France and abroad comply with competition law. The Group’s competition compliance programme applies to all Group employees, in particular regarding their relations with customers, competitors, partners and suppliers.
A team of lawyers specialised in competition law within the Group’s Legal Department conducts numerous online or classroom-based training courses worldwide to all employees and new hires. A best practices guideline, memos and regular publications on competition law news are broadly disseminated within the Group.
The ever-changing requirements in this area call for constant monitoring of regulatory developments, close cooperation with the relevant national and international authorities as well as empowerment of all staff through access to an interactive platform enabling them to understand guidelines and best practices for working with high risk countries and exports.
CMA CGM has also bolstered its compliance approach to economic sanctions through a training programme including a mandatory e-learning module for all employees and classroom-based training courses (new hires, dedicated business lines, etc.).
In the event of doubt, employees are strongly encouraged to consult the Competition Compliance division of the Legal Department or their local correspondents to ensure that their actions are compliant. Any breach of competition rules by an employee can be reported using the Ethics Hotline whistleblowing platform.
Suppliers and service providers from whom the Group purchases goods and services are also required to comply with the Group’s policy on competition law. The Group implements specific measures when it acquires companies or creates joint ventures with partners in order to comply with the competition rules applicable to such transactions.
 CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group

4. Personaldataprotection
For the past several years, CMA CGM has applied a personal data protection policy to its information systems and subcontractors.
CMA CGM implements the organisational and technical means to protect the personal data of data subjects (customers, suppliers, employees, third parties) and extends its compliance policy to subcontractors and subsidiaries to guarantee compliance with European personal data protection rules worldwide.
To apply its policy on personal data protection, the Group has set up:
● An intra-group data protection policy;
● A network of Data Protection Officers (DPOs); ● A training plan for employees;
● An audit plan.
Le The DPO appointed by the Group ensures that the personal data protection policy is properly applied.
Compliance: corporate culture achieved through awareness-raising initiatives and training for all
Compliance culture is promoted within the Group in various ways:
● "Tone at the top": Top executives and managers regularly remind teams of the importance of complying with business ethics and ensuring that the projects they supervise are dealt with in an ethical manner, in accordance with applicable laws, the Code of Ethics, and internal policies and procedures;
● Adapting the compliance approach based on perceived risk: the focus should be on sectors with high risk of non-compliance by adapting compliance efforts based on our risk map;
● Dissemination of policies over the intranet: employees can consult documentation on the Group’s policies and procedures relating to its compliance programme on a dedicated page on the intranet. Tools are also available for employees, including those enabling the identification of countries subject to economic sanctions. Our Code of Ethics, Third Party Code of Conduct and various Ethics and Compliance policies are available to the public at www.cma-cgm.com(“Ethics and Compliance” space);
● Employee training. Training is also a key component of the Group’s Compliance policy:
- Classroom-based training courses are held regularly both at head office and elsewhere in France for employees most exposed to compliance risk.
- E-learning training modules on ethics and compliance are mandatory for Group employees. They are regularly updated.
- All new employees are required to follow a training course on ethics and compliance. They must read and sign the Code of Ethics online before starting their employment contract. They then receive a reminder email concerning all the e-learning modules on compliance that they are required to take. Since 2019, awareness-raising initiatives on competition law, preventing and combating corruption and influence peddling, economic sanctions and personal data protection are conducted by a member of the Ethics & Compliance Department as part of induction training for new employees.

Whistleblowing system: Ethics Hotline
 The reporting of potential or proven breaches to laws, regulations, Group policies or procedures are embodied in the Code of Ethics, which fosters accountability among employees with regard to ethical conduct.
The website http://cma-cgm.ethicspoint.com enables CMA CGM employees and third parties to:
● Ask the Ethics & Compliance Department questions;
● Make a report using an online form;
● Make a report by calling a dedicated phone number
(listed per country and available on the Group’s
website or the intranet);
● Remain anonymous if they wish and local
regulations allow;
● Access a 24/7 platform;
● Protect their identity.
Launched in 2019, the Ethics Hotline system may be used to collect statistics on reports made.
The whistleblowing system, online or by telephone, is open to all Group employees and third parties, including suppliers and subcontractors. It is available 24/7 in several languages.
It ensures that whistle-blowers remain anonymous if they wish and local regulations permit. An in-house procedure provides the framework for reports made under the whistleblowing system, specifying the rights and obligations of each party. A non-retaliation policy is in place to protect whistle-blowers against all forms of retaliation.
The CMA CGM Group undertakes to protect individuals who, in good faith, report a potential breach of law or internal policies.
Consequently, employees are encouraged to use any means possible to report any breach of the Code of Ethics, compliance policies or applicable procedures and regulations to Management, their line managers or the Group Ethics & Compliance Department, including:
● Fraud and/or corruption;
● Anti-competition practices;
● Respect for human rights;
● And, more generally, any potential breach of the
Group’s Code of Ethics or policies.

French law on due care – due care plan – effectiveness report
The purpose of the law is to identify, monitor and implement actions regarding due care risks, as part of a continuous improvement approach.
Upon adoption of the law, CMA CGM set up a cross- functional working group comprising members of the CSR, Risk Management and Procurement functions to address the five measures, with the initial objectives of:
1. Adapting the due care law to the CMA CGM Group’s organisation, by:
● Identifying all actions undertaken by the Group
regarding health, safety, the environment and people
● Identifying the scope and breaking down the Group’s
business activities:
- Within the company: office-based activities,
operational maritime and terminal activities
- Outside the company: suppliers and subcontractors
2. Identifying and assessing risks and defining controls and action plans to mitigate them.
This year, we reinforced our implementation of and actions provided for in the due care law by:
● Bolstering our risk identification and assessment system within the Group;
● Extending the risk map scope: including the “Logistics and intermodal” business activities for the Group, excluding CEVA Logistics business and identifying risks per product category;
● Identifying Group steering indicators, including a Human Rights indicator;
● Enhancing Sustainable Procurement policy.
As part of this continuous improvement approach, we
have defined the areas we would like to reinforce in 2020:
● Bolster due care governance at Group and Site and operational level, with the Sustainability Department in charge of such governance;
● Include the CEVA Logistics subsidiary;
● Continue identifying performance indicators and
objectify them;
● Strengthen controls relating to due care risks as part
of the Group’s Internal Audit programme;
● Extend the due care risk analysis to the “customer”
scope.
     The French law on due care (Loi sur le Devoir de Vigilance) was adopted in 2017. It requires parent companies and subcontracting companies to implement reasonable measures regarding risks to human rights and fundamental freedoms, health, safety and the environment resulting from their own operations and those of their subsidiaries, subcontractors and suppliers.
The law requires five measures to be implemented:
  ● Draft a due care risk map
● Define a risk assessment procedure
● Implement suitable actions
● Set up a whistleblowing system
● Set up a monitoring and assessment scheme
 CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group

Mesure1: Draftaduecareriskmap
An initial Group due care risk map was drafted by reviewing all risks already identified in the various departments. An assessment of risks relating to fundamental freedoms, health and safety of people and the environment that are not covered by existing maps, based on the Risk Management Department’s methodology, was also performed. A risk assessment by operational purchase category was performed with a focus on risks relating to the French due care and Sapin II laws.
The scope includes the following activities: Office-based activities in France and abroad, operational maritime activities, terminal activities, suppliers and subcontractors.
An initial risk breakdown and assessment was performed with the creation of:
● Five Fundamental Freedoms, Human Rights and
Health, Safety and Security risk categories
● Five Environment risk categories
● Six Procurement risk categories
In 2019, the 2018 risk map was reviewed. The scope was extended to include the “logistics and intermodal”18 business comprising: owned assets over various countries across all continents and suppliers and subcontractors that form part of the sustainable procurement programme. The main risks identified for this activity relate to human rights, working conditions and labour
law, in particular with regard to local subcontractors/suppliers; and the environment, major risks of pollution (in particular water/soil) and waste management in general.
Supplier and subcontractor risk assessments were extended in collaboration with the Group’s Risk Management Department. The scope was extended and action plans identified. Consolidated mapping will be performed in 2020 to highlight the Group’s overall exposure to each risk and enable the main challenges to be dealt with in a uniform manner.
The updates and scope extension highlighted the following main due care risks for the Group:
● Risks to the health and safety of people and security
risks abroad;
● Risks of pollution and harm to biodiversity;
● Risks relating to climate change and air pollution;
18 The CEVA Logistics subsidiary was excluded from this scope for 2019
● Risks relating to the employment of subcontractors/suppliers;
● Risks relating to the dismantling of vessels.
The risk of non-compliance with the due care law was included in the 2018 map of major Group risks. This risk map is updated quarterly and presented at meetings of the Audit and Risk / Audit and Accounting Committees.
  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 69

Mesure2:Defineariskassessmentprocedure
Alongside updating the due care risk map, the Group holds numerous discussions and meetings to validate and find solutions to identified risks. The following is a non- exhaustive list:
● Every year, the Group is assessed by the business sustainability rating firm EcoVadis. The assessment questionnaire includes numerous questions relating to the due care law.
● In 2019, CMA CGM was awarded Gold status for the fifth consecutive year, with a substantially higher rating in particular due to progress in the human resources category.
● In 2019, the Group held discussions with customers, suppliers, organisations and other stakeholders on due care issues to share feedback, ideas and identify areas for improvement.
● The Group also performed a regulatory watch on the due care law to gain a better understanding of stakeholder requirements.
● Legal notices and summons were also monitored and analysed in order to define and implement:
- Corrective actions for the Group;
- Suitable actions if a trading partner had been
summoned or given notice for non-compliance with the due care plan, in particular at the Purchasing Department’s Selection committee (Comité de Triage) meetings.
● At the end of 2019, the Group joined the United Nations Global Compact. Nine of the ten principles are directly related to the due care law. As a participant the Group is required to prepare a Communication on Progress (CoP) on the Ten Principles as of 2020.
● The CMA CGM Group participates in various cooperative work groups such as Clean Cargo, the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network, the ContainerShip Safety Programme, Cargo Incident Notification Scheme, and Business Actions to Stop Counterfeiting & Piracy. The purpose of these intercompany working groups and organisations is to foster dialogue and share best practices for continuous improvement at both strategic and operational level.
Mesure3:Implementsuitableactions
When updating the risk map for each activity, an action plan is defined, per activity and risk category.
The following items are updated on an annual basis:
● Fundamental freedoms, working conditions: ongoing dialogue with staff representative bodies, trade union agreements concerning working time organisation, procedures for compliance with the Maritime Labour Convention regulations for seafaring personnel
● Health and safety of people: Policy, annual goals and action plans. Prevention campaign via the reporting of near misses, Accident Prevention Committee for the fleet, specific programme on quality of life at the workplace and the prevention of asbestos risk, policy and procedures in connection with employee travel to high risk countries (Travelsafe), etc.
● Environment: crisis management plan in the event of major pollution, programme to equip the entire fleet with a ballast water treatment system, policy and goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per transported container by 30% between 2015 and 2025, investment in Liquefied Natural Gas-powered vessels, scrubbers and low-sulphur fuel especially in relation to the Sulphur 2020 regulation, policy for dismantling only in shipyards, which have been audited and certified compliant with the guidelines of the Hong Kong convention, etc.
● Sustainable procurement: In 2019, the CMA CGM Group bolstered Sustainable Procurement initiatives, deploying an overall supplier assessment programme addressing financial aspects, corruption, CSR and due care, economic sanctions, competition, GDPR compliance and raising awareness among all its suppliers and purchasers on these issues:
- Evaluation Assessing all new suppliers using our qualification process to better manage supplier risks regarding corruption, human rights breaches and the environment. It is a five-stage digital process:
 1- Preliminary definition of the risk level
 2- Risk assessment through an internal
questionnaire by Cscreen and EcoVadis
 3- Analysis
 4- Supplier qualification
 5- Monitoring over time
- Enhancing existing documents: adding CSR clauses to
our contracts and General Terms and Conditions of Purchase (Due Care, Ethics & Compliance, GDPR compliance, Health, Safety and Security)
- Launching an internal and external awareness-raising campaign among Group purchasers and suppliers
- Dedicated organisation: A sustainable procurement division dedicated to raising awareness, supporting
 CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group
70

purchasers, performing second-level controls and
setting up an international network of ambassadors
- Governance: a supplier risk committee meeting once every two months with all stakeholders, and a Selection committee (Comité de Triage) to facilitate
the decision-making process for purchasers
- Setting up monitoring indicators as part of a
continuous improvement approach
To provide optimal support to suppliers in this continuous improvement approach and ultimately impact the entire value chain, the Group encourages its Tier 1 suppliers to draft a Code of Conduct or Code of Ethics for their own suppliers and subcontractors.
In 2018, the Group’s Code of Ethics and Third-Party Code of Conduct were updated.
In 2019, in order to facilitate discussions and mutual understanding, these two Codes were translated into five additional languages. Other significant events in 2019 included:
● The Compliance unit at head office was enhanced and the global network of Ethics & Compliance correspondents extended - 72 correspondents in more than 100 countries on 5 continents to answer all Ethics & Compliance related questions;
● Training and communication programmes for preventing Ethics & Compliance risks were improved;
● A CSR and Environment Manager joined the CSR
Department, which now directly reports to the Deputy
Chief Executive Officer;
● The Group’s CSR approach was aligned with the UN
Sustainable Development Goals, and an order of priority established.
With regard to suppliers and subcontractors, special measures were taken in 2019 regarding the combat against concealed employment, in particular by raising awareness among purchasers, prescribers and suppliers, but also by setting up weekly reporting on the due care law.
Mesure4:Whistleblowingmechanism
The reporting of potential or proven breaches to laws, regulations, Group policies or procedures are embodied in the Code of Ethics. Reports are made via a whistleblowing system addressing all of the Group’s internal and external stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, subcontractors, associations, trade unions, etc.) – cf. page 66: Whistleblowing system: Ethics
The platform is accessible via the Group’s corporate website http://cma-cgm.ethicspoint.com and provides an outlet to:
● Ask the Ethics & Compliance Department questions;
CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group
● Make a report using an online form;
● Make a report by calling a dedicated phone number
(listed per country and available on the Group’s
website or the intranet);
● Remain anonymous if whistleblower so desires and if
local regulations so allow; ● Access a 24/7 platform:
With regard to the following areas: ● Fraud and/or corruption;
● Anti-competition practices;
● Respect for human rights;
● And, generally, any potential breach to the Group’s Code of Ethics or Policies.
NB: Under its non-retaliation policy, the CMA CGM Group undertakes to protect individuals who, in good faith, report a potential breach of law or internal policies.
In each business line, systems have been set up to ensure maximum effectiveness: 24/7 hotlines, recording of emergencies relating to the Environment/Health & Safety/Safety of People/Geopolitical and Health Monitoring
Mesure5: Setupamonitoringandassessment scheme
Measures are monitored and their effectiveness assessed by the various departments responsible for their implementation.
Qualitative and quantitative data are consolidated quarterly for Operational CSR Committee meetings and an annual summary of progress and action plans for the following year are prepared as part of Corporate Social Responsibility reporting. See “2019 Gaols and Achievements and 2020/21 Action Plan” page 22
The reliability and completeness of key performance indicators are audited by the Statutory Auditors as is the case for financial data.

Focus – defining a “Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms” indicator:
In 2019, an analysis of qualitative and quantitative Group data relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was performed. A specific analysis was also performed on 2019 reports relating to “Labour“ and “Health/safety”. Several sources were analysed:
● EcoVadis and its “360” external stakeholder inputs – 1 case
- EcoVadis is a business sustainability rating firm. Every year, we fill out the EcoVadis questionnaire comprising four themes, three of which are directly related to human rights: Labour & Human Rights, Ethics and Sustainable Procurement. This year, we significantly improved our performance in the “Labour & Human Right” theme.
- EcoVadis also performs an additional study using a multitude of data from external stakeholders. The aim is to collect information and opinions, both positive and negative, on companies’ performance regarding labour, the environment and ethics. If a case is significant, for instance, involving a fine, a sanction or conviction, the score for each theme would be negatively impacted. EcoVadis factors in information and data from over 100,000 sources across media, governments, trade unions, NGOs and business networks.
● “Labour” and “Health/Safety” deficiencies and detentions identified during port state controls – 491 deficiencies, including 13 relating to human rights (Maritime Labour Convention) and fundamental freedoms or health and safety in 2019 and one detention. To check the seaworthiness of vessels, the port of call countries carry out regular on-board inspections and port state controls (PSCs). If problems are detected, deficiencies are recorded and may result in the detention of the ship.
● Internal Audits– 70 assignments in 52 countries conducted by the Directorate for Risk Management
   CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group
72

and Internal Audit to check compliance with rules applicable to the company, including standards, regulations, specifications and customer specifications. The Directorate also checks whether organisational and operational provisions have been established, disseminated, understood and applied, identifies areas for improvement and issues recommendations. The Group’s internal audit programme involves analysing human rights issues.
● Reports from the Group’s whistleblowing mechanism – 54 reports, 20% of which related to Human Rights, Fundamental Freedoms and/or Health issues. 54 reports were issued using the hotline. These reports were systematically analysed and, where applicable, internal investigations were carried out, sometimes resulting in corrective or disciplinary actions.
The aim is to identify Human Rights indicators and, ultimately, create a procedure for measuring and assessing the “Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms” risk within the Group.

  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 77

1. Customersatisfaction:improvingthecustomerexperienceateach step of the customer journey
 Patricia PICINI
Head of Global Accounts, Customer Experience & Marketing - CMA CGM Group
“In terms of customer experience, we need to listen and take into account the views of each person, throughout their journey and whenever we are in contact”
Rodolphe Saadé, Chief Executive Officer of the CMA CGM Group, has set all his teams the goal of becoming the top choice for shipping customers.
Through the Customer Experience programme, CMA CGM aims to work more closely with customers and treat them as partners by “Caring beyond Shipping”.
Accordingly, CMA CGM has drawn up an ambitious transformation plan to enhance all interactions with customers with new expertise, innovative, sustainable product offers, improved services and a simplified customer experience through new technologies.
CMA CGM is fully committed to supporting its customers and their development. It has created new value-added services while honing the execution processes for existing products.
Through these innovative solutions, the company can specifically address customer needs, thereby making CMA CGM a key partner in their logistics chain.
In 2019 the following value-added products were particularly promoted by the Group:
Traxens: smart containers, so called
because they are equipped with top-
of-the-line connected technologies
that send data, almost in real time,
regarding the movement (position,
etc.) and condition of freight (temperature, impact detection, etc.). Customers benefit from better traceability as well as cost optimization tools.
Cargo Value SERENITY: the premier product of the SERENITY line offers new guarantees and coverage for our customers to provide compensation for unpredictable events during shipping. Simple, fast and customised, this product promotes more effective and cost-effective management of logistics chain risks.
Reefer pharma: with the specific know-how and stringent controls required by the pharmaceutical industry, pharma reefers guarantee optimal safety
and compliance with both
international quality standards and the recommendations of the European Commission
     Customer centricity, a concept unveiled at the TPM19 conference in 2018, is one of the Group’s strategic priorities. It encompasses a programme to improve the customer experience that was launched to help CMA CGM:
 Meet new customer expectations
 Stand out from competitors with an innovative range
of services
 Capitalise on its closeness to customers
19 TPM, a conference organised by the Journal of Commerce, is one of the shipping industry’s most important events.
    CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group
78

Shipfin: a new line of import and export financing services to support our customers’ international development (Supply Chain Financing and
Cargo Financing, two complementary, customised solutions).
Network: this service facilitates prospecting for our customers, and helps them establish contacts with reliable, trusted partners (currently only in the pilot phase).
The CMA CGM Group is also transforming by intensifying its offer for online businesses.
For example, the Group improved its digital customer experience by launching CMA CGM eSolutions, a fully digital ecosystem for a secure, simpler and more effective customer experience.
With eSolutions, CMA CGM has expanded its offer with a new set of digital features for customers. The products are both easy and fast to use.
For example, My Price makes it possible to check negotiated prices, get a quote, or make a booking at the click of the mouse. Customers also now receive instant booking confirmation, and online electronic payment is being gradually rolled out one country at a time.
CMA CGM has also created novel services that genuinely stand out from the competition, such as paperless bills of lading. CMA CGM is one of the pioneers in the shipping industry to offer entirely digital bills of lading that can be sent in one click. Paperless bills of lading remove the risk of fraud or document loss and speed up the shipping procedure.
It is clear to see how this new sales channel helps customers boost productivity and develop business.
For its key accounts, the Group has also designed a programme of services and benefits specifically for business, creating a strong relationship between customers and CMA CGM.
To best manage service quality, provide faster response times and work closely with customers, CMA CGM has made changes to its internal organisation and implemented a plan to streamline work processes.
Some of the initiatives set up by the Group include a new customer service tool that has been rolled out to improve the experience for employees and increase customer satisfaction and gratitude.
It is being gradually adopted by the agencies and shared services centres to ensure end-to-end service quality. It has also been integrated into the eCommerce platform
and will incorporate other new features throughout the coming year.
The Group is also shoring up its in-house training programme on change support. The training provides sales teams the product knowledge they need, and also addresses transformation as it affects the way employees work. Organised by each region, the training will help the whole network adopt a customer centric approach and play an active role in improving the customer experience.
Customer satisfaction is a core concern of CMA CGM. As such the company has committed to improving its service quality. In 2015 it set up a Customer Charter, and every year it conducts customer surveys.
To provide more visibility on service quality, CMA CGM plans to define and publish a new customer satisfaction indicator: the Net Promoter Score (NPS).
The NPS measures the likelihood that a customer would recommend CMA CGM to someone else; by extension it reflects the degree of customer satisfaction. In the annual survey, customers are asked: “How likely is it that you would recommend CMA CGM to a friend or colleague?” A score is derived from the positive or negative answers. The annual surveys help CMA CGM discern and analyse customer expectations. The Group has also set up post- transaction surveys for customers to instantaneously give their impressions of a specific event using the new customer service tool.
By continually improving the customer experience, CMA CGM pursues customer centricity and speeds up development through:
Better knowledge of vertical markets (sales support): determining suitable customer segmentation, sales management and targeted market insights;
Better service: a global commitment throughout the entire CMA CGM Group, based on the Group’s customer segmentation;
Facilitated business by simplifying processes and providing fresh solutions;
Greater transparency by providing reports on carbon emissions, service quality levels, transit times achieved, port conditions, etc.;
     Bolstered cooperation with our (acknowledgement and support given to customers by teams of sector-specific experts).

Innovation fostering operational performance
When Rodolphe Saadé took office as Group CEO at the beginning of 2017, one of the first things he did was create an investment structure, a genuine support strategy for innovation. It is called CMA CGM Ventures. Upon its inception, the fund contributed capital to some twenty ventures. The investment philosophy of CMA CGM Ventures is based on three key Group concerns: customer relationships, operating efficiency and employee well-being.
CMA CGM’s venture capital fund helps new companies in France and elsewhere grow. They benefit day-to-day from CMA CGM’s network and ecosystem of partners, customers and suppliers. The goal is to form lasting operating partnerships with start-ups, with a view to mutual value creation.
In 2019, CMA CGM Ventures invested in several innovative start-ups with a strong connection to the Group’s business lines, such as:

   CMA CGM supports the development of Notilo Plus and has chosen their solution for underwater vessel inspection
The CMA CGM Group, a leading global provider of maritime transport and logistics, has opted to support the financial and industrial development of Notilo Plus, a Marseilles-based start-up specialising in autonomous underwater solutions. The support will help the company launch manufacturing.
Notilo Plus develops autonomous underwater drones
Notilo Plus was founded in 2016 and is based in Marseilles and Lyons. It develops
autonomous underwater drones with AI and D&A capabilities for both the shipping
industry and leisure use.
Last December, Notilo Plus received the Jacques Saadé prize from Rodolphe Saadé, CEO of the CMA CGM Group, at the Trophées de l’Économie 2018 ceremony. In the meantime, Notilo Plus has joined ZEBOX, the international business incubator and accelerator for innovative start-ups in Marseilles.
CMA CGM and Notilo Plus sign a cooperation agreement
Fully convinced of the potential of the product offered by Notilo Plus, CMA CGM wanted to work with the Notilo Plus teams to develop a specific solution for the Group’s vessels. The system will make it possible to automate – and thereby perform a greater number of – hull inspections, improving vessel productivity and making safety inspections systematic.

Supporting the economy and local innovation
ZEBOX
ZEBOX is an international business incubator and accelerator for innovative start-ups, founded in May 2018 on the initiative of Rodolphe Saadé, CEO of CMA CGM. It opened its doors on 27 September that same year. ZEBOX is headed by Matthieu Somekh and leverages a circle of corporate partners that are all leaders in their fields: ACCENTURE, BNP Paribas, Centrimex, CEVA, CIMC & EY. ZEBOX brings all these talents together under one roof. It facilitates joint development and creates business opportunities between start-ups and partners. It also fosters the development of innovative solutions for all and creates crucial new players.
ZEBOX concentrates on two industries: Industry X.0 and transport, logistics and mobility. Every chosen project centres on cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, virtual or augmented reality, IoT and robotics.
ZEBOX offers start-ups two support programmes based on their stage of development. business incubation is aimed at new start-ups, providing support to 15 of them for 12 to 18 months, while business acceleration boosts eight established start-ups for eight months.
“Le Carburateur” business incubator and accelerator
In 2017, the CMA CGM Group decided to take part in the creation of Le Carburateur, a business incubator and accelerator in the fifteenth district in the north of Marseilles. Le Carburateur brings together a comprehensive set of skills under one roof to create a dynamic ecosystem where member entrepreneurs can successfully launch their companies. The incubated companies find advice, workspaces, tools, a network and contacts to get ahead.
CMA CGM decided to renew its support in 2019 by making a financial contribution to Le Carburateur for operating costs. The contribution helped Le Carburateur welcome more new companies than in 2018 and offer them new services.
In 2019, ZEBOX provided support to 30 start-ups:
 21 through business incubation (including two destined for the Caribbean)
 9 through business acceleration
More than 300 start-ups interviewed / €7.7 million in capital raised / Around forty new jobs created
2020/2021 goals and outlook:
 One year after ZEBOX was founded, a new milestone will be reached with the impending opening of a new incubation hub in the Caribbean at the end of the year
 To expand ZEBOX’s offer, expertise and network, new non-corporate partnerships are being examined: CEA Tech, Innospace, Digital Hub Logistics Hamburg
 A new “Energy” hub will be developed at ZEBOX to address this key topic with such strong applications for shipping and logistics
 Creation of specific clusters within the ZEBOX start-up community, such as the Green Tech cluster
    CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group

This year, along with our financial support, two new initiatives were rolled out:
Patronage for start-ups and SMEs
Five directors of the CMA CGM Group agreed to mentor five start-ups or SMEs incubated at Le Carburateur.
Each director provided concrete help of his choice to entrepreneurs, sometimes giving of his time, sometimes giving tailored advice.
A new entrepreneurship competition
After the success of the call for applications sponsored by CMA CGM in 2017, Le Carburateur and the CMA CGM Group wanted to renew the endeavour this year to stimulate entrepreneurship in southern France. This time they joined forces with two large companies in Provence: PONANT and NGE Group.
This year’s competition focused on three topics:
 Transport, logistics and mobility (sponsored by CMA CGM);
 Sustainable tourism (sponsored by PONANT);
 Environment trades and sustainable building
and infrastructure (sponsored by NGE).
After pre-screening by a jury of experts from each company, the grand finale in December brought together nine start-ups who presented their projects before the jury.

The Group also took part in several summits:
  CMA CGM took part in the Movin’On World Summit on Sustainable Mobility
The Movin'On Summit, held from 4 to 6 June in Montréal, brings together almost 5,000 participants, start-ups and speakers every year to discuss sustainable mobility.
For its first time at the event, CMA CGM proposed a workshop on cutting the environmental impact of freight shipping.
CMA CGM was thus able to present its related service offer, both in terms of the modal transition to maritime transport and the intermodal offer.
Rodolphe Saadé shares his vision of the Mediterranean of the future
Act III of the Méditerranée du Futur forum in Marseilles brought together several hundred people from around the Mediterranean basin. Rodolphe Saadé took the stage as an expert speaker.
The CEO of the CMA CGM Group shared his vision for the Mediterranean:
 Cleaner – the world’s largest LNG container ship, the CMA CGM JACQUES SAADÉ, will be delivered soon
 More digital – the ZEBOX business incubator welcomes many start-ups from around the Mediterranean
 More appealing to business – the CEVA Logistics head office opened in Marseilles, creating 200 jobs and a genuine logistics hub in the city

2. Sustainableprocurement: establishing lasting relationships with suppliers and subcontractors
CMA CGM assigns great value to establishing stable, lasting relationships with its suppliers. To this end, the Group, purchasing advisors, suppliers and subcontractors work in close cooperation.
France’s new Sapin II Law and law on due care of parent companies and contracting authorities have led the Group to reinforce oversight arrangements pertaining to anti-corruption, human rights and limiting environmental impact of its business activity. – see page 61: Compliance with requirements of the Sapin II Law
Strategically, the Group has opted to work on all these matters simultaneously using a single method so that changes are implemented and appropriated smoothly.

In 2019 the CMA CGM Group further promoted sustainable procurement by rolling out a comprehensive supplier assessment arrangement:
Ongoing work of the Supplier Risk Committee
In 2017 the Group created a Supplier Risk Committee for better management of procurement risks within the Group and to monitor actions in place. In addition to all the line representatives to the procurement department, the Supplier Risk Committee convenes the key stakeholders working in areas concerned by supplier risk (Legal, Compliance, Audit and Risk, Human Resources and CSR departments). At committee meetings, best practices are shared and action plans on regulatory changes concerning suppliers are prepared.
A multilingual Third-Party Code of Conduct to shore up CSR
In 2014 the CMA CGM Group created a Third-Party Code of Conduct. It outlines all of the Group’s CSR commitments and obligations as well as expectations for suppliers and subcontractors. Suppliers considered during calls for tenders and those awarded contracts otherwise must sign the Third-Party Code of Conduct before any agreement is signed.
The Code is systematically included in contracts. To strengthen CSR arrangements and promote accountability of suppliers, CSR clauses are added to purchasing agreements and the General Terms of Purchase. – see page 62: Third-Party Code of Conduct
The cornerstone: a procurement risk map updated annually
In 2018 a procurement risk map has been established at Group level. The risk assessment methodology used is the same as that applied by the Group’s Risk Management department – see page 21: Group risk management and risk maps
The “procurement risk” map:
 Outlines purchasing areas and regions
 Assesses the risks of corruption and economic
sanctions and risks to human rights, health & safety,
the environment, etc.
 Breaks down sub-risks by category of suppliers and
intermediaries
 Defines action plans aimed at reducing risk
The risk map is updated annually by each Procurement department in conjunction with the Group Risk Management department.
A single, five-step assessment tool for suppliers and subcontractors to identify and manage procurement risks
A worldwide tool for assessing suppliers and intermediaries has been set up. It covers financial aspects, corruption, CSR, economic sanctions, tenders and the GDPR. It is intended to bolster management of supplier risks pertaining to corruption, human rights and the environment. The five-step digital process includes:

1. Preliminary definition of the risk level
2. Risk assessment through an internal
questionnaire by Cscreen and EcoVadis
3. Analysis
4. Supplier qualification
5. Monitoring over time
Expanding existing contractual documents: clauses on CSR issues, such as due care, ethics & compliance, GDPR, and Health & Safety, are drafted and appended to contracts.
Implementing an awareness programme, both in-house with group buyers and externally with suppliers: In-person training and e-learning;
A newsletter for the purchasing community was rolled out;
An Intranet that can be consulted by all players was set up;
Systematic awareness training is provided for all new arrivals.
Implementing a risk-specific organisation and network of ambassadors: a procurement unit specifically for awareness training and support for buyers and second level controls, and an international network of ambassadors.
Governance: the supplier risk committee meets with all stakeholders every four months (procurement, risk, legal, compliance). There is also a “screening” committee to support buyers with decision-making.

Monitoring indicators set up for
continuous improvement
To measure how effective actions were, new monitoring indicators were identified covering the main procurement risks:
The global supplier and intermediary assessment system was rolled out in 2019 under the supervision of the Group’s Central Purchasing Department, initially with a pilot period of threemonths before being gradually implemented group-wide.
100% of the procurement centres have received training and adopted the system.

  Example of actions set up with suppliers:
100% green electricity
  Purchasing renewable electricity is a top concern for companies today. The Indirect Procurement department in France has signed 100% green electricity contracts to cut direct greenhouse gas emissions.
This locks in green electricity costs over a long period and protects against changes to the carbon tax.
Five sites in France are now supplied with 100% green electricity, and others will follow!

1. DiversitywithintheGroup
The strength of the CMA CGM Group lies in the diversity of the men and women working there, a diversity which is a key support of its strategy. As a source of inspiration and innovation, diversity helps us to better understand customer expectations and offer them tailored transport solutions and high-quality services.
Within the company, diversity takes root from the moment of recruitment.
Both in France and abroad, our HR teams are trained in use of the “Thomas International” test to encourage better hiring decisions.
This assessment tool provides a precise depiction of an individual’s behavioural model in work situations. The test score leads to constructive dialogue with candidates, who can confirm or disagree with the analysis of their professional profile. The “Thomas APP” provides additional information to supplement the assessment made by the recruiter.
Diversity within the Group is reflected in gender equality, multiculturalism, and intergenerationality. The resulting emulation encourages mutual enrichment.

Gender equality
For many years, the CMA CGM Group has been committed to promoting gender equality in the workplace.
This commitment is demonstrated by a strong recruitment, promotion and training policy as well as the organisation of events, such as themed lunches, as a time to share, talk, inform and collect suggestions from female employees and recommend new actions (Women’s Day, Pink October, conferences, communication campaigns, etc.).
Some 14% of females working at the Group’s offices hold a management position, while 37% of managers are women. Additionally, 100% of French female seafaring personnel and 64% of international female seafaring personnel are naval officers.
Pursuant to the Copé-Zimmermann law laying down rules for gender balance in boards of directors (over 40% of female directors), the CMA CGM Board of Directors comprises over 45% of female directors32.
a. WeareShipping
The We Are Shipping programme aims to support women in their professional development and promote harmonious internal diversity in management functions.
Since 2018, more than 80 women have joined this leadership development programme. It features a set of actions and events such as group coaching, testimonials of women with an inspiring career path, personal branding, training, joint development, and personalised HR support to help women work on their development plan and broaden their French and international professional network.
In 2019, the We are Shipping programme was rolled out in Asia and Lebanon.
The programme is already starting to produce encouraging results in terms of mobility and promotions, as well as a general awareness that it is to everyone’s advantage to develop diversity in-house.

b. Professional equality index
The index assesses difference in pay between males and females using several indicators:
● Eliminating the gender pay gap
● Gaps in the percentage of pay rise and number of
promotions
● Pay rise for female employees returning from
maternity leave
● Number of women within the top ten employees with the highest remuneration
In 2019, for its first assessment of this type, the Group obtained a score of 77/100 for France.
The Group will continue to promote professional equality through many programmes that encourage female access to top company positions.

Addressing disability within the
company
The CMA CGM Group supports people with special needs during their professional career.
At the head office in Marseilles, the Occupational Health department is responsible for identifying people with disabilities. Once the Group has been informed, it provides tailored measures to adjust, adapt or transform work stations to help disabled employees keep their jobs. Some of the main initiatives include work station adaptation (e.g. foot rests, headsets, ergonomic chairs, specific computer hardware, etc.), the provision of a designated parking space, and two days of additional leave for employees with a dependent disabled child.
As a further step, in 2018 the Group Human Resources Department initiated a working group examining the
handling of disability within the company. The goal is to increase awareness of diversity’s rich potential as a source of inspiration and creativity for the company.
In 2019, the “All Different” programme sprang from the working group, and several actions have been set up, such as:
● Creation of a specific Group intranet page (objectives, definition of disability, process, contacts)
● Appointment of the company disability officer
● Creation of a specific email address for more effective
communication on the topic
In Marseilles, the Group Human Resources department also examined the possibility of calling on a specialised company in 2020 to develop IT services (e.g. functional tests of IT applications) with the help of high-functioning autistic individuals and/or individuals with Asperger’s syndrome and/or people with disabilities.

2. Workingconditions
An onboarding process to integrate
new recruits
Integration is an essential issue and has become a major lever in retaining and developing new talent. Onboarding is a decisive period of an employee’s career that deserves our entire attention and requires the involvement of all company stakeholders.
The onboarding process implemented in the USA and France is helping the Group impart professional knowledge
during employee integration.
Even before arriving in the company, new employees benefit from special support in performing administrative formalities. They also receive key information through a digital portal to help them appropriate the company’s culture and values.
In 2019, the C&Me Onboarding process was rolled out in Singapore. New recruits now benefit from a more user- friendly information portal.
Group Code of Ethics
In Marseilles, the Jacques R. Saadé Tower houses over 2,500 employees representing 65 different nationalities.
To promote dialogue, build new relationships, expand employees’ professional network and foster the integration of new hires, the C-Lunch application was rolled out in 2019.
Available in French and English, C-Lunch is an in- house application developed by the Digital Factory teams. It is initially intended for all employees at the Marseilles and Le Havre sites.
The simple-to-use application lets employees set up in-house lunches (date, time, topic, number of participants) or look for one and sign up for it.
     The CMA CGM Group strives to give equal opportunities for professional development within the company to all staff. The Code of Ethics clearly outlines the Group’s commitment to diversity and equal opportunity.
Our integrity is grounded in respect for and protection of fundamental rights and freedoms as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In line with the declaration, the Group has committed to eliminating discrimination of any kind, based on nationality, class, race, disability, gender, age, religion and political views.
More broadly, the Group’s anti-discrimination policy addresses freedom of opinion, job placement and retention for disabled employees and job equality as per the collective bargaining agreement.
  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 98

Social dialogue
Social dialogue is a vital part of company life. It mainly involves providing employees with information. Strategic, economic, financial, social and organisational questions are addressed in a range of committees attended by personnel and management representatives.
In accordance with French legal requirements enacted in 2019, various staff representative committees (the works council, health & safety committee and union representatives) were merged into a single body: The Social and Economic Committee (Comité Social et Economique or CSE).
In addition to the Social and Economic Committee (CSE) in each branch, there are also the Group Committee and Central Social and Economic Committee (CSEC) in France, the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Commissions (CSSCT), and a variety of specialised joint commissions.
Pursuant to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and by virtue of the principles instituted in its Code of Ethics, the Group respects the freedom of labour unions and the rules of association in the countries where it operates.
In France, several agreements40 were signed in 2019:
● Amendment No. 1 on the issue of an extraordinary
bonus for the 2018 financial year
● Collective agreement on maintaining the collective
employee guarantees under the sale of CMA CGM Logistics France to CEVA Logistics Freight Management
● Collective agreement on maintaining the collective guarantees of CMA CGM Logistics employees whose employment contract falls under the trilateral intra- group employee transfer agreement within CEVA Logistics France SAS
● Amendment No. 2, 3, 4 and 5 to the teleworking experiment within the Marseilles and Le Havre facilities
● Amendment revising the facility agreement on the set-up of a working time clocking and checking system at the Marseilles facility of the CMA CGM economic and social unit (UES)
● Agreement on the set-up of the Social and Economic Committee (CSE)
● Pre-election agreement protocol on the CSE elections at the various facilities
● Amendment No. 3 on the reduction of scope of the CMA CGM economic and social unit (UES)
● Granting of an extraordinary bonus_UES_13 December 2019
● Agreement on maintaining the collective guarantees of CCLOG France and CMA CGM Logistics
Work organisation
In France, since 2007, the inland office employees of the CMA CGM France economic and social unit (UES) have had an agreement on the 35-hour work week (French ARTT). In addition to the legally mandated 37 hours of effective working time, the “Convention on Days Worked” amendment to the ARTT agreement ensures flexibility for employees who are paid a flat rate. It also lays out tracking and organisation of workloads and the number of days worked. Generally, in all organisations, managers must ensure workloads are well distributed and that their teams are optimally organised.
Working time is systematically organised in line with the prevailing local legislation.
Special working time arrangements have been instituted in some areas to enhance work-life balance and best meet the needs of customers.

Teleworking
In 2019, the teleworking experiment was opened up to new departments in the company.
Teleworking is an innovative way of organising work with such varied benefits as better work-life balance, improved working conditions for employees and greater independence in the accomplishment of their tasks.
To this end, several amendments renewed the teleworking arrangement throughout 2019, and it was opened up to new departments at the Marseilles and Le Havre sites.
Since 2018, 691 employees who met the eligibility criteria have teleworked for one day per week as mutually agreed between the employee and their manager.
To support them in this process, a guide has been drafted to answer all their questions. Teleworking applications are managed in the in-house application C-Park, which simultaneously reassigns the parking space of the teleworking employee.
For greater agility and to promote employee communication and mobility, the company has been transforming its tools for several years.
Dedicated intranet: Galaxy
In 2018 the CMA CGM Group rolled out its new digital workplace:
“Galaxy”.
The purpose of this information platform is to:
● Improve communication and help all employees
discover the Group universe
● Break down information silos so that employees can
dialogue more easily
● Create communities to encourage a cooperative
strategy
Galaxy was rolled out at the same time as a plethora of Office 365 tools and applications (OneDrive, Teams, Yammer, SharePoint, Forms, etc.).
To help employees adopt the new tools, the digital team created a Digital Adoption Centre run by a special team. Its purpose is to help employees with daily use of the tools, through training workshops, information pages, and a community of “Galaxy” ambassadors.
   To encourage the emergence of ideas, a community of “Galaxy” ambassadors was formed. Passing on knowledge in-house, these employees facilitate the transition to Galaxy Office 365 tools within their respective
 and the
departments and networks.
There are currently 144 Galaxy ambassadors in the Group.
In 2020, the company intends to expand this community and give its members a key role in the transformation of Group tools.
 CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group

 Focus on CMA CGM applications
To support the company with the transformation of its tools and promote the emergence of more agile methods, the Group Digital Team has developed several applications to facilitate employees’ daily working lives:
C-Travel: to make business travel easier and safer.
The application digitalises the TravelSafe Passport and the Group Travel Policy. Employees have very easy access to all information needed to manage their business trips, such as customs to follow in other countries, expense reimbursement, and the taxi policy. Once downloaded, the content is also available offline, and travellers can directly contact the Group’s emergency hotline at the touch of a button.
C-Park: optimises parking at the Jacques R. Saadé car park in Marseilles by reassigning available parking spaces when employees are absent. To do so, it is interfaced with the leave management software for visibility on available parking spaces. C-Park is also used to apply for teleworking.
C-Lunch: developed for the HR Department by the Digital Factory teams, this application makes it possible to create and sign up for business lunches. Employees may be invited to create and/or attend special events to build new relationships, expand their professional network, help new hires integrate, gain a better grasp of other business lines, or simply not lunch alone
 CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 101

 Work organisation for seafaring personnel
The work organisation for seafaring personnel complies with the international standards set by the Maritime Labour Convention 2006 which entered into force on 28 February 2013.
The minimum rest time cannot be less than 10 hours per period of 24 hours and 77 hours per period of seven days.
The fleet management department adopted the rest time system, and monthly working hours are monitored both on board and on land to ensure our compliance. To ensure that seafaring personnel get enough rest and avoid fatigue, the Group initially set a monitoring threshold of 120 hours for the operating crew and 150 hours for ship stewards. In general, the Captain and the Chief Mechanic on board oversee that the Maritime Labour Convention standards are followed.
Maritime Labour Convention
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) met in 2006 to create a single document aggregating all the obligations concerning the working and living conditions on board vessels. The Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) was created, adopted and published, and became mandatory as of 2013. International maritime law now has four pillars:
- SOLAS for safety: International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea
- MARPOL for the environment: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
- STCW for training and certification: International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification
and Watch-keeping for Seafarers
- MLC for social protection and working conditions – Maritime Labour Convention that sets the
minimum living and working conditions for all seafarers
In August 2017, 84 members of the ILO ratified this convention, representing 89% of global shipping.
The MLC 2006 consists of five titles:
- Minimum requirements for seafarers to work on a ship
- Conditions of employment
- Accommodation, recreational facilities, food and catering
- Health protection, medical care, welfare and social security protection
- Compliance and enforcement
Due to the high quality of its vessels, CMA CGM was able to implement the MLC well before the 2013 deadline.
During the certification phase, no major shortcoming was found and whenever vessels are inspected, the Group demonstrates excellent working and living conditions on board its ships.
  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 102

Quality of life at the workplace and prevention of psycho-social risks
a. Qualityoflifeattheworkplace
An action plan on Quality of Life at the Workplace has also been introduced, structured around optimising working processes and procedures and providing specific workshops on best practices for reducing psycho-social risks.
The plan continued in 2019 with the occupational psychologist. An e-learning session was created to train managers on quality of life at the workplace: identification of risk factors, support for employees in difficulty and stress management.
Efforts to improve quality of life at the workplace mainly relate to ensuring better follow-up of employees. For instance, a support process has been introduced to assist employees returning from long-term absences. Amongst other things, it includes various types of meetings organised between the human resources team, the manager and, if needed, the occupational psychologist.
Several steps have been taken to ensure a good work-life balance for employees. For example, a gender equality agreement41 lays down 100% coverage of paternity leave for office-based and seafaring personnel; working time arrangements for pregnant women; the provision of 12 cribs within a private day-care centre to accommodate 18 children of employees; payment of an “early childhood allowance” through the Social and Economic committees; and the establishment of customised schedules for full- time employees (variable time slots) for all office-based institutions in Metropolitan France.
Barring any emergencies, travel must be planned in advance. Seafaring personnel must prepare ship departures well in advance so as to take into account family constraints expressed by employees. The working conditions are discussed at meetings of the Health and Safety Committees attended by Union and Management Representatives.

Happy At Work
In 2019, to gain a better
understanding of
employee aspirations,
stay agile and attentive
to the quality of our in-
house practices, we
decided to sign on to the “Happy At Work” approach offered by “ChooseMyCompany”.
All employees within the France office scope were invited to answer an anonymous survey on professional development, a stimulating work environment, management, salary & recognition, pride of work, and pleasant work conditions.
Fully based on employee ratings, the Group received the “HappyIndex® / AtWork for Starters” label that recognises those organisations with the most motivated employees aged 29 or younger.
In 2020, we will renew our commitment to the “Happy at Work” approach and continue our overall reflection on quality of life at the workplace.

  As part of a collective approach, the “Wellness” pilot programme was launched in Marseilles. As the name implies, it focuses on four areas devoted to employee well-being:
Eat Well
This programme aims to improve nutritional balance by introducing organic food at the company cafeteria.
Various “Eat Well” initiatives include:
- Offering balanced breakfasts
- Setting up a station for organic vegetarian food at the company cafeteria
- Organising thematic breakfasts with a dietician who advises employees on how to achieve a balanced
diet
- Showing calories on the menu
- Promoting the Sodexo application that provides the nutritional breakdown of dishes it sells
In parallel, the dining areas were renovated to offer employees a fresh experience, namely the Mini Market and the connected café, a functional, innovative and inviting area of 250 square meters.

   Move Well
To encourage employees to exercise, the Fitness centre was overhauled.
It is now a more pleasant, functional area, fitted with new machines that make it possible to do a 30- minute circuit to tone muscle and improve posture and balance. Employees can use the equipment alone or enjoy tips from a coach while exercising.
The Fitness courses offered have also been expanded to new disciplines like yoga, meditation, self- defence and TRX, and the facility is open for longer.
The eponymous “Move Well” app that was rolled out offers employees a new digital experience. At any moment they can sign up, reserve courses, see the schedule and pay online.
In 2020, new programmes on emotional balance (Feel Well) and sleep quality (Sleep Well) will also be developed and offered to employees.

The “Conciergerie by CMA CGM” offers a wide range of services to employees such as:
- General services: dry cleaning, ironing, shoe repair, mending and tailoring, administrative procedures, etc.
- Home services: child minding, homework assistance, house cleaning, small home repairs, gardening, etc.
- Delivery services: medication, flowers, take-away, etc.
- Other services: shirts and ties, coffee capsules, stockings, etc. -
Every day, employees can consult with the concierge during opening hours. There is also a private connection for them to contact an around-the-clock call centre to book the services that they require. The services can be paid for online through a secure payment or via an e-wallet.
In 2019, 5,997 requests were handled by the concierge service.
Partnership with Hôpital Européen
To help employees benefit from accessible, quality healthcare, the CMA CGM Group has formed a partnership with the Hôpital Européen that is located near the CMA CGM Tower.
Employees benefit from preferential appointments for consultations and medical exams.

 Quality of life at the workplace for seafaring personnel
Our approach to this concern is both proactive and comprehensive:
It is proactive as it seeks to improve quality of life at the workplace as a whole and not simply to comply with the legal requirement to prevent psycho-social risks.
It is comprehensive as it leverages social and organizational aspects at work and assists employees with their active approach to well-being.
The joint “Quality of Life at the Workplace” group has continued its work. Its role is to analyze the results of the social monitoring and Quality of Life at the Workplace surveys, while issuing recommendations.
The group continues its work on assignments undertaken in previous years: ship ergonomics, the land-sea relationship, working quality of life on board, simplification of on-board administrative processes, and analysis of accidents with fault tree analyses in conjunction with the victims of these accidents.
The CCP group has set up specific training for the Quality of Life at the Workplace officers on board the vessels. The training was tailored and then transferred to the Maritime Prevention Institute for certification approval before being extended to all shipping companies.
The Quality of Life at the Workplace officers on board vessels will be provided with awareness-raising tools to conduct their prevention actions. The CCP group will act as a “back-up” support for these individuals.
A partnership with Human Fab (formerly ESP Consulting), an expert sports and performance centre, has been set up to optimise the health and physical performance of seafaring personnel and reduce the rate of accidents.
Human Fab set up a pilot group on board a vessel for three months to perform its mission, become known to the seafaring personnel and gather ideas for future improvement from them. The outcome showed a 40% improvement in physical condition for all assessed criteria.
CMA CGM wants to bolster its Quality of Life at the Workplace actions by incorporating topics like sleep and emotional management for seafaring staff.
Other areas for improvement:
On-board catering. Freely chosen, direct provisioning without going through a ship chandler yielded satisfactory results in terms of food quality and overhead costs, so was extended to all ships. Standardisation of fitness rooms so that all seafarers can exercise.
New actions have been conducted to promote and raise crew awareness of Quality of Life at the Workplace, good managerial practices, and addiction prevention.
 CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 107

b. Psycho-social risks
The Group’s policy on psycho-social risks is covered by an agreement signed on 20 May 2010 (agreement on preventing psycho-social risks among employees of the CMACGM economic and social unit). The document provides milestones for a preventive programme to measure, analyse and monitor psycho-social risks. Recommended actions include:
● Preventing mental or sexual harassment and instituting a reporting procedure
● Organising manager training courses on psycho-social risk prevention
Since the agreement was signed, a psychological support unit has been set up. The unit is available by telephone or online 24/7 and is a completely confidential space for employees to talk to someone of their choice. In addition to preventing psycho-social risks, it embodies the Group’s sustained promise to improve life in the workplace for its employees. Several long-term projects have been launched at both the individual and collective levels. The priority areas to work on are work environment, social climate and employee support.
As part of the 2018 action plan, the Group commissioned an external training organisation to continue providing training to managers regarding good managerial practices.

3. Talentdevelopment
Career management
Thierry Billion
Chief Operating Officer, CMA CGM Group
"Our employees are our most precious asset. Therefore we invest constantly in developing their skills".
The Group continues to develop career management, by transforming its HR tools, amongst other things.
C&Me “Talent Management” module offers a new approach to talent management and better HR support, from succession plans, talent identification and assessments to optimisation and forecasting of organisations by activity.
Within this context, the Group has implemented a “High Potential” identification process. This international review of individuals identified as “High Potential” is used to determine key positions and plan for succession.
Furthermore, the Group encourages initiatives from all employees seeking to embark upon new challenges. To this end, the Performance Interview allows office-based employees and their line managers to take stock of their objectives, measure their performance, form new career development goals and express their training needs.
In 2020, a new Performance Interview format will be offered in France and several pilot countries outside France. It will feature interview timing that matches our activity, a simplified format, constructive feedback that gets to the heart of business, and individual development plans.
Mobility puts skills where they are needed within the Group. In addition to conventional types of mobility, such as expatriation, local contracts and secondment, the Group’s mobility policy offers several innovative career paths. As a result, employees are better able to expand their range of skills, hone their expertise or achieve managerial positions.
    CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group
109

The Group HR Department
rolled out this pilot project in 2019 in Marseilles. Its purpose is to provide employees with better assistance with their mobility projects, meet their needs for information on the Group’s businesses,
and provide optimal support throughout their career.
The comprehensive HR tool is designed to give employees:
● Une Greater visibility of the Group’s businesses
● A broader view of cross-skilling or potential job
transfers between business lines
● A dedicated area and specific times to discuss with key
business players, form ties and foster opportunities
● Tools to help them prepare their development plan
The first event of the C-Careers pilot brought together over 200 employees for a conference on “Discovering jobs at the Commercial Agency Network (CAN)”, followed by discussions with field workers.
The innovative Junior Upwards Mobility Programme (JUMP) gives our young talents a chance to work abroad for six months to discover new jobs and a different working environment. Every year, some twenty employees take part in this international mobility programme.
“SWAP” is another option whereby two employees from different entities trade jobs.
The VIE programme (Volontariat International en Entreprise, a French internship programme) sends young graduates to our organisations in other countries to expand their knowledge, acquire new interpersonal skills and help standardise practices and procedures within the Group. At the end of their contracts, we offer them career opportunities and a chance to take on new challenges to help the Group grow. In 2019, 30 VIE participants were stationed primarily in Africa, Asia, and North and South America.
Finally, every year, the Group offers employees expatriation contracts in a number of different countries. In addition to sharing best practices and standardising working methods, international mobility gives employees exposure to more responsibility and the chance to widen their range of skills.
Employees are kept informed of international mobility throughout the year through discussions, conferences and targeted communications.
   Several other events made it possible to discover CAN jobs in even greater depth:
● Cafés Témoignages, combined discussions and coffee breaks for employees to gain inspiration from the career path of spokespeople representing various jobs.
● Group and individual HR support workshops to help employees succeed with their mobility goals (building a mobility project, writing a CV, preparing for interviews and preparing a pitch).
● Themed lunches organised in C-Lunch are also planned, where experts are invited to help employees discover a given job and discuss mobility possibilities.
 CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group

Various programmes are set up to attract, retain and develop the talents within the Group:
● Le The Sponsorship programme helps executives
integrate the company faster and more smoothly.
● Mentoring is also available to help employees settle
into a new job.
● Coaching and E-coaching facilitate the development of
soft skills as well as international mobility.
● 360° Feedback
In 2019, the emphasis will be on developing Mentoring within the company and in Asia.
A panel of managers will be invited to take part in an information session on Mentoring that will be coordinated by the Group Human Resources Department. At the end of this session, a selection of managers who have volunteered to take part in the programme will receive a half-day of training on the role and responsibilities of a Mentor. To support them, a mentor discussion group has been created.
These programmes are based on establishing close relationships, trust and mutual respect, and allow experienced employees to share their knowledge of the Group, network and experience.
In 2020, the programme will be more broadly rolled out in other countries.
360° Feedback
Since 2018, the Group has been actively developing an overall corporate culture of feedback.
360° feedback is an individual development tool:
● Comparing self-perception (self-assessment) and colleagues’ perception identifies strengths and areas for improvement that a participant might not know otherwise.
● An individual development plan is then constructed around concrete actions.
The pilot project was launched with some of the Corporate Officers in Marseilles so that, in turn, they can become drivers of the feedback culture within their organisation.
In 2019, 360° feedback continued to be developed and the HR team was trained in use of the debriefing tool. In becoming thoroughly acquainted with the 360° debriefing tool, the HR teams can support development plans and foster growth of the corporate feedback culture.
School for General Managers (GM)
In 2019, the Group Human Resources Department launched a development programme specifically for general managers at our international sites, in conjunction with the CMA CGM Academy and the Commercial Agency Network (CAN).
The pilot programme aims to develop their understanding of Group strategy and corporate culture, in addition to supporting their individual needs in terms of professional development.
The career development route will include various steps: identifying individual development needs with 360° feedback, online micro-training and a four-day training programme at the head office in Marseilles. GMs will also benefit from peer mentoring and individual coaching.
The pilot programme is slated to be launched in 2020 with a selection of 25 GMs.

 Managing the careers of seafaring personnel
The individual in charge of fleet management regularly monitors the careers of seafaring personnel. A briefing is held at each embarkation to check that everyone’s certificates are valid and that seafarers have attended all mandatory training sessions.
The Group offers inland career development opportunities, such as temporary missions to bolster skills and give seafarers the possibility of a “land-sea” career.
A competitive wage policy
In order to attract, retain and motivate talent, CMA CGM relies on a wage policy with three priorities:
● Equality within the company
● External competitiveness
● Performance-based remuneration
Since July 2016, when the APL teams were integrated, the CMA CGM Group has undertaken a comprehensive endeavour to harmonise salaries and health insurance, welfare and pension schemes, in approximately 40 countries. This involved comparative studies of both amounts (e.g. of salaries and social benefits) and structures in the countries under examination.
As a follow-up, an audit was initiated in late 2017 for all Group companies. In 2018, the audit report provided an exhaustive assessment of the Group’s supplementary health care, welfare and pension schemes.
Health insurance and welfare scheme harmonisation continued in 2018 and led to the signature of an umbrella policy with an international broker on 1 December 2018. The broker’s scope will initially extend to 55 countries for which it will negotiate the policies or policy renewals for the Group (life insurance / permanent disability and health care).
The CMA CGM Group is thereby demonstrating its desire to align the health and welfare coverage of Group employees with market practices (in the same industry), while taking into account unique local and regional characteristics.

A strategic training policy
The Group’s training policy is part of a comprehensive strategy on career management and skills development. While addressing its strategic concerns, the Group is also committed to maintaining and bolstering its employees’ skills.
Training of office-based personnel
Training of international seafaring personnel
The sharp increase in training hours for office-based personnel is due to:
● Broadening the scope to include international personnel
● An increase in training hours for French office-based personnel due to launch of the “Leadership” offer.
CMA CMA CGM Academy helps all employees on a daily basis in all their job-related activities and offers a wide range of e-learning or classroom-based courses with an instructor to meet everyone’s needs. CMA CGM Academy supports Group strategy via strategic actions such as bolstering human expertise combined with agile organisation.
For seafaring personnel, 2019 was a year of refocusing on training fundamentals. It should be noted that 17,009 hours of classroom-based “Mentoring” training sessions should be added to the total training hours for seafaring personnel, for an aggregate 93,474 hours.
In 2019, CMA CGM Academy rolled out a training programme for captains: The Master Management Program. It was created to improve management methods of our international Senior Officers on board Group vessels.

 Dans LNG training programme
In preparation for the future integration of LNG Dual Fuel vessels into our fleet, in accordance with new environmental regulations, the Academy has created a complete training programme to meet the needs of both seafaring and office-based personnel.
Part of the programme deals with regulations, while the other has been customised to deal specifically with our vessels.
The goal is to develop everyone’s skills on the topics and ensure that new technologies are used more safely.
     CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 114

Leadership offer
To help employees hone their soft skills, CMA CGM Academy has rolled out its Leadership programme. The innovative training sessions call on both in-house and external trainers to address such topics as stress management, communication, conflict management and feedback.
To ensure optimum implementation of the various LISA training modules (such as LISA Procurement, Intermodal, Sales Target, Cargo Flow, Customer Allocation, etc.), CMA CGM Academy has put together a network of “Super Key Users” and “Key Users” who are trained and guided by the CMA CGM Academy.
In parallel, specific training for international HR staff has also been delivered to provide support on data entry in C&Me.
The “Negotiation Advanced” programme was also rolled out by the Academy to help Group buyers develop their negotiating skills.
In 2019, CMA CGM Academy developed innovative new job-specific courses at head office and the regional offices. The courses are designed to meet the training needs of each population.
For example, the “Port Operation” course was designed for the operating professions at the agencies, while the “Fuel Management Basics” course is intended for operations staff at head office, CMA Ships Superintendents and the Bunkering and Chartering departments.
The Lab: devoted to innovation and transformation
Certificate training programmes
 In 2019, the CMA CGM Academy proposed innovative workshops to the Lab, such as joint development for employees that have taken the management course.
This method enables employees to improve their professional practices through the experience of others.
Other workshops on design thinking and digital innovations also gave Group employees the chance to work on cutting-edge approaches to address new issues facing the Group.
In 2019, the CMA CGM Academy also developed certificate training programmes for France.
These comprehensive

  Fostering creative cooperation with Thecamp
Thecamp is a campus for innovation and networking focusing on the city of tomorrow and the digital transformation.
Throughout the year, CMA CGM encourages employees to go there for workshops such as Leadership of the 21st century, or to seek out inspiration and design, anticipate and build a desirable future, with the help of new technologies.
Training for seafaring personnel:
Training for seafaring personnel revolves around STCW 2010 (the international convention that sets forth certification standards for each maritime profession). Some of these certificates are renewed every 5 years after refresher training. Additional training courses are required by CMA Ships and offered to seafaring personnel to boost their skills.
An efficient information system
The Human Resources information system, C&Me, has been helping standardise HR processes around the world. The tool offers greater visibility of all HR programmes (mobility, development, training) and fosters more efficient, detailed HR management, including by managing objectives and skills. Lastly, it encourages employees to be more proactive in furthering their careers.
All the HR processes have been reviewed through C&Me, making them simpler, more standardised and leaner and thereby more in line with the key issues at stake for the Group. The HR teams and managers have all the latitude they need to manage team resources:
● “Talent Acquisition”, for recruitment and internal mobility;
● “Talent Management”, a career management tool;
● “Talent Performance” to measure and encourage
employee development;
● “On Boarding”, dedicated to the integration of new
employees;
● “Work Force Analytics”, a reporting tool that offers
each HR BP summarised information and key indicators for their scope.
Since 2018, the new C&Me interface has provided a better user experience for Group employees (simplified design, more intuitive interface, compatibility with mobile terminals, etc.). In 2020, the mobile version of C&Me will become available for Group employees.
In 2019, the Group’s external recruitment portal was also entirely redesigned with a new look and new graphics for an enhanced user experience (clearer view of openings at the Group, compatibility with mobile telephones, etc.).

General Policy
 Employee health and safety is a major priority for the Group. Some activities and jobs carry significant risks, particularly on-board vessels, as well as at terminals and warehouses.
The CMA CGM Group’s health and safety policy is designed to avoid any accident which may result in injuries or the loss of human life to employees at sea or on land, or major damage to the vessels, cargo or the environment. This is achieved by establishing an Integrated Management System (IMS), a set of procedures which are periodically assessed and revised. These procedures are common to all vessels managed by CMA Ships, regardless of its flag.
Terminals & Inland Networking Analysis:
Further to this, a Group Terminals and Inland QHSSE policy has been developed covering all inland terminals and sites, with the implementation of common standards formalised through the
QHSSE Guidelines. This approach is centred on the "top 10 critical risks”.
   In 2019, to meet the challenges linked to the expansion of the port terminal portfolio (managed by the Group) and the extension of the scope to inland warehouses, the Terminals & Inland QHSSE division launched the Tin@ digital solution. The app makes it possible to report any incident, near-miss or dangerous situation from a smartphone or tablet. This form of instant communication improves response time and removes red tape that can slow down decision-making and preventative action, for example. The app provides an overall view of all QHSSE events as they unfold as well as the performance of each site. The solution is part of the " paperless" policy implemented at many sites.
In 2020 the app is slated for deployment at all 61 Terminals and inland sites subject to the Corporate Terminals and Inland QHSSE policy.

Maritime safety
Maritime safety is governed by stringent local and international regulations, mostly determined at an international level via the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), but also at regional and local level. These laws and regulations are complex and subject to frequent change. The Group’s compliance is routinely evaluated through a series of external audits by authorities, the port of call country and classification societies, as well as through internal inspections and audits.
Accordingly, each vessel is subject to three-fold regulations, each with its own specific inspections:
● International regulations (MARPOL, SOLAS, IMS Code, etc.)
● Regulations of the ship’s flag state. The CMA CGM owned fleet sails under 12 different flags, primarily from the European Union and Singapore
● Local or regional regulations
As a means of checking the seaworthiness of the vessels, port of call countries carry out regular inspections on board the ships, known as Port State Control (PSC). If a regulatory, mechanical, procedural or organisational

year, the department audits the vessels and other Group assets, to verify that the CMA CGM health and safety policy is properly applied. It also coordinates operations in the event of a major crisis.
53% of the Terminals subject to the CMA CGM HO Terminals QHSSE policy48 are ISO 9001-, ISO 14001- and/or OHSAS 18001-certified. As part of the ongoing improvement process for terminals’ QHSSE performance49, the close of 2019 saw 17 certifications obtained and maintained.

If the deficiencies noted are serious enough to call into question the seaworthiness of the vessel, it will be detained by port authorities until the necessary modifications are carried out to restore the vessel to a propercondition.
So as to be proactive and promote the CMA CGM Group's health and safety policy, as well as IMS procedures, PSCs are regularly performed by teams from the SSE department. In 2019, PSCs were performed in China (MSA), Russia and Australia (AMSA). In addition to this, joint PSCs between CMA CGM and the flag state were performed on board vessels to pool inspection methods.
During 2019, the owned fleet’s rate of deficiencies per PSC (Port State Control) was 0.99, compared to 0.91 deficiencies per PSC in 2018.

 A proven crisis management plan
Although CMA CGM safety management procedures are mainly preventive, the Group also has a comprehensive plan for managing crisis situations. The plan contains responses to emergency situations on board ships as well as at branches and terminals. The plan is tested at least once per year and regular training sessions are delivered to improve the response capabilities of the crisis management teams. In addition, the Group carries out regular drills in conjunction with the authorities to prepare for potentially dangerous events, such as pirate attacks, emergency towing, fire and oil spills.
In the event of a crisis, the affected entity first calls the 24/7 emergency hotline where it is put in touch with the person on duty. This person informs the various departments of the situation, and based on the severity of the event, decides to form a crisis team bringing together all the relevant parties. There is a dedicated room for this purpose in Marseilles and Singapore with all the necessary means of communication. Any crisis is therefore managed from this room. Once the crisis has been resolved, an investigation is carried out to determine the underlying causes and learn from them in order to avoid recurrence of the same event.

 Fleet Navigation Centre: state-of-the-art technological resources
Modern technological resources are developed in-house by the expert captains of Fleet Centres in order to mitigate navigation-related risks, such as those related to the weather. These resources are then provided to captains and officers on board Group vessels and include navigation aid systems or decision-making systems for navigation during bad weather. At the Navigation control centres located in Marseilles, Singapore and Miami, experienced ship captains constantly track the routes, analyse risks and advise and support the fleet vessels as well as the Group’s operational staff.
The navigation centres are also tasked with ensuring optimum ship piloting in terms of fuel consumption, compliance with ship speeds in whale breeding habitats and compliance with regulated navigation areas. To this end, experts at the centres have developed innovative piloting methods and methods for the kinematic monitoring of vessels coupled with powerful analysis tools that take into account geography, weather and marine currents in real time, as well as piracy risks. This year, a new tool was developed to anticipate delays and congestion in order to reduce speed as soon as possible and cut waiting time at ports. It is an innovative way to achieve a smaller carbon footprint.
In partnership with the Reefer Department, the Fleet Centres have become GDP-compliant (referring to Good Distribution Practices for pharmaceutical products) and now monitor highly sensitive reefers in real time, such as Aquaviva, Pharmaceuticals & Superfreezer.
A team of ship captains with expertise in vessel operation study and set the rules for nautical access to all ports at which the group calls. Given the introduction of new ships into the fleet, as well as the constant changes being made to ports and terminals, a group of experts is needed with experience in the operation of large vessels, to study navigation-related risks and to pro-actively set rules for port access. In essence, this involves adjusting cargo capacity in order to guarantee economic profitability while constantly safeguarding vessels, crews and the port environment. The rules of access therefore concern the ship’s measurements (length, beam and draught), the needed support resources (such as tugboats) and the acceptable hydrometeorological conditions (tides, currents, wind). To this same end, feedback is collected to provide successive ship captains with the most up-to-date and relevant information possible.

 Search and rescue
As the oceans are so vast, shipping industry players have to work together to rescue individuals in danger. At any time, ships may have to be diverted to assist another ship in distress. These operations are known as Search & Rescue (SAR) operations. In 2019, five such operations were carried out by vessels in the owned fleet.
Stowaways
Measures have been put in place on board ships to prevent stowaways from boarding, to regularly look for stowaways, and if applicable, to manage any stowaways found on board. These procedures have been included in the Ship Security Plan (SSP), which is set by the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS).
The ship’s SSP is a confidential document. In 2019, 13 stowaways were found on board vessels.

Occupational health and safety
The Group’s approach to risk prevention revolves around the assessment of risks relating to health & safety and working conditions. This is a process of ongoing improvement whereby all players, from General Management to seafaring and operational staff, are involved on a day-to-day basis.
The owned fleet sails under various state flags in international waters, with seafarers from different cultures and nationalities. As a result, standardising procedures and practices within our fleet has become a major issue. With this in mind, the Accident Prevention Committee (APC) was created. It meets regularly to review health and safety outcomes, regulatory changes, feedback from vessels and innovations which may improve safety on board vessels.
At the various maritime, inland and office-based entities, all risks are identified and assessed in accordance with applicable regulations, and then covered in annual preventionplans.
The prevention plans address various themes such as personal protection equipment, chemical risks, psychosocial risks, addictions and noise exposure.
The main health and safety risks to employees differ based on business activities:
   Shipping activities
 Terminal activities
   Fire / explosion
 Falls from height or tripping and falling
 Stevedoring risks
 Exposure to chemicals
 Psychosocial risks
 Movement and posture
 Noise / Vibration
   Collisions
 Fire / explosion
 Falls from height
 Stevedoring
 Energy
 Falling objects/cargo
 Vibrations
 Every quarter, feedback on events that occurred on board (accidents, near misses and inspections) is compiled and discussed among the owned fleets. This gives seafarers the opportunity to draw from each other’s experiences and puts them in a better position to anticipate risks.
Training and awareness campaigns are crucial components of prevention. They include compulsory job-related training courses; awareness sessions on land, on board or at work stations; distance learning for seafaring staff; special training courses for all second officers; regular drills; and navigation simulators. Seminars are held at the head office and attended by officers from all the Group’s fleets. Attendees discuss a range of operational and on-board safety topics, such as analysis of reported events and safety management.
 CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 128

    Furthermore, the Group is an active member of the Container Ship Safety Forum (CSSF). Founded in 2014, this non-governmental organisation brings together major shipping players with the aim of improving safety performance and container shipping management practices.
With regards to terminal activities, CMA Terminals, a subsidiary of the CMA CGM Group, is a member of the International Cargo Handling Coordination Association (ICHCA). This independent non-profit organisation is dedicated to improving the safety, security, sustainability, productivity and efficiency of cargo handling and transport by all modes and at all stages of national and international supply chains.
 Terminals Seminar
The Quality, Health, Security, Safety and Environment (QHSSE) department welcomed representatives from 18 terminals for two days at our head office, for an annual seminar on health and safety issues. The seminar was an opportunity to take stock of the past year, give QHSSE recommendations for 2019, and above all share experiences.
Each terminal (Malta, Casablanca, Kingston, Montoir, Rotterdam, Le Havre, Pointe-à-Pître, Fort-de-France, Dégrad des Cannes, Natal, Kaohsiung and Seville) presented the health and safety initiatives it had undertaken, with each presentation rated by the participants.
At the end of the seminar, Olivier Texier, Deputy Central Director of Health, Safety & Security, Boris Wenzel, Managing Director at Terminal Link and Cédric Rousseau, QHSSE Terminals and Inland Division Manager, presented awards for the three best initiatives, namely Pointe-à-Pître (first prize), Montoir (second prize) and Kingston (third prize).

During 2019 :
     Frequency of industrial accidents - with sick leave
Terminals52
13.18 Fatal accidents 1 0
The frequency of industrial accidents with sick leave at terminals managed by the Group has decreased over the last five years due to an effective prevention policy over the entire scope. Between 2018 and 2019, the average frequency of industrial accidents with sick leave has not changed, in the knowledge that we have expanded the scope over the past 2 years.
Severity 0,2 0,2
The frequency of accidents in the maritime scope increased year-on-year in 2019, with a rate of 1.88 this year against 1.25 in 2018. The severity set in 2018 has not changed. The frequency of recorded accidents increased in 2019 but their overall severity decreased for a larger number of vessels year-on-year. They primarily involved young and/or inexperienced seafarers, a demographic that is increasing at a rate matching that of fleet growth and which unfortunately lacks maturity in terms of safety culture. The main challenge for 2020 is to work on this angle to reduce the number of accidents.
Accidents on board vessels involving seafaring staff are not the only ones counted by the Company. Accidents affecting shore-based staff working on board are also tracked, reported and analysed.
Industrial accidents with leave of more than 24 hours and/or those near misses considered very serious are routinely investigated to analyse the causes and introduce appropriate corrective and preventive actions.

 Near misses
A near miss (or dangerous situation) is a sequence of events and/or circumstances which could have caused damage or harm. Near misses must be studied and recorded, and experiences shared, to reduce the probability of similar incidents occurring. Most industrial accidents are preceded by near misses which should have served as a warning. In 2019, CMA CGM recorded 2,134 near misses, a marginally higher number than those recorded in 2018 (1,950).
  Asbestos risk
CMA CGM is continuing its actions to manage risk from the asbestos found on ships, in compliance with French and international regulations.
Led by the ad hoc committee, many actions have been taken so far by the companies. In addition to seafarer training, asbestos has been identified on board ships and, where needed, removed or abated. Measures have been taken to control asbestos dust levels in the air. Crews have been provided with operating procedures, personal and team protective equipment in the event they must work on asbestos- containing materials. Materials and equipment supplied are controlled in the course of construction, routine maintenance and technical shut-down of ships. Finally, asbestos actions are communicated to the maritime authorities, administration, maritime occupational health and safety board and trade unions.
 CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 131

Cargo Security
The CMA CGM Group transports a wide variety of cargo, ranging from general cargo and manufactured goods to consumer products and dangerous goods. Some cargo can represent a danger during transport, so the Group has set up a dedicated organisation to inspect, analyse and prevent risks related to the carriage of goods. For this purpose, the Group divides goods into three categories:
● Goods qualified as dangerous by international
regulations (e.g. the International Maritime Dangerous Goods code or IMDG) or national laws (CFR49 – Code of Federal Regulations) that impose strict regulations on transport (packaging, segregation, temperature, stowing, etc.)
● Potentially dangerous goods that require recommendations: chemicals in reefers, loading and acceptance of heavy lift items, etc.
● Controlled goods subject to regulations preventing or limiting their movement (e.g. waste, protected species, etc.).
To manage dangerous goods, the Group has a dedicated computer application connected to the overall computer booking system. The application electronically incorporates international regulation, thus making it possible to control the way dangerous goods are declared then packaged and stowed in the container.
Potentially dangerous goods are those which may represent a risk, such as out-of-gauge, break-bulk, or
poorly declared cargo, and goods shipped in reefers or flexitanks. With regards to these, the Group has provided its in-house customers with three experts who are tasked with providing safety advice to the lines and agencies. These three experts are also responsible for advising the lines, the agencies and the dangerous goods offices on goods subject to restricted movement. Finally, the CMA CGM Group uses its best endeavours to prevent unlawful carriage of goods in accordance with regulations and the Group’s Code of Ethics. This mainly relates to goods on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, those covered by Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES, also known as the Washington Convention), the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, and various UN rules on embargoed goods.
Faced with a resurgence in container fires throughout the container shipping industry, particularly in the last two years, the Group has decided to set two major priorities to eradicate these accidents, in close collaboration with other shipping companies and our main insurers. Our first priority is to improve our computer tool designed to search for false declarations of goods, particularly those likely to cause a fire, and to set up an organization capable of processing this data in real time. In the short term, shipping companies will exchange key terms via the CINS to help identify false declarations or even use a shared false declaration detection system.
 CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group
132

The second priority is to improve the safety of ship-loading plans by taking into account the risks specific to each dangerous item, the fire response capabilities of ships and the need to limit the spread of any fire incident on board. In November 2019, CINS published a basic document aimed at improving the stowage of dangerous containers on board ships.
    Active involvement by CMA CGM within CINS
The Group is a founding member of the Cargo Incident Notification System (CINS), an information-sharing platform for large maritime companies (70% of loaded TEUs) that enables rapid notification regarding security and safety issues of container-transported goods.
The system has already significantly improved the quality of container cargo transport.
To fight against false declarations, the 17 CINS member companies moved to set up a joint system to detect poorly-declared loads in order to improve the overall safety of container ships.
CMA CGM actively involved with BASCAP
The Group works closely with organisations known for fighting counterfeiting and arms trafficking, such as BASCAP (Business Actions to Stop Counterfeiting & Piracy).
 CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group

International Security
At sea
With the aim of preventing and dealing with threats at sea, CMA CGM has developed a comprehensive range of operational, legal and human measures. These measures are constantly reassessed and tailored to the changing security context (piracy, trafficking, etc.). The risk of piracy is therefore continuously monitored and analysed, and each solution is tailored to appropriately respond to identified piracy hotspots (West Africa, Indian Ocean, South-East Asia, etc.).
In 2019, approximately 178 piracy events were recorded worldwide, of which 144 were confirmed pirate attacks. Of these 178 attacks, most took place in West Africa. More than a hundred incidents involving piracy were recorded in the Gulf of Guinea in 2019, almost doubling in the space of a year. There has been an increase in both the number of kidnappings and the degree of violence used by the kidnappers.
Eight CMA CGM Group ships faced piracy events over the past year, although none of the Group's ships were hijacked.
On land
For several years, CMA CGM has developed a comprehensive land safety policy. Through relevant and appropriate protection measures and means, this policy aims to reduce the exposure to security, health, natural and technological risks of the Group's activities and personnel, across the globe. CMA CGM thus seeks to guarantee everyone an optimal level of protection.
For example, countries around the world are classified into different levels of criticality, depending on the risks identified in each of them. For each country, appropriate measures are thus put in place, both for the security of Group companies and for the protection of employees, whether they are local, expatriate or traveling. Within the Group, 85 countries are classified at risk. Any traveller going to these countries must first be registered with the Group Security Department, and briefed if necessary.
In 2019, more than 1,000 trips to high-risk countries were changed.
The Group had to deal with more than 101 situations directly impacting its activities and / or its personnel (vs. 84 direct impacts in 2018), for some of the implementation of an ad hoc crisis unit. While these situations were multifaceted, such as natural disasters, armed conflicts, threats against certain employees or even emergency medical evacuations, it should be noted that 2019 was particularly presented by a significant increase in problems. climatic and social (major social conflicts in particular in Lebanon, Iraq, Chile, Bolivia, Hong Kong, etc.).
  Active involvement by CMA CGM within CINDEX
The CINDEX (inter-company centre for expatriation) is a place for dialogue and sharing best practices on international mobility strategies and policies by a network of major European groups. Each member benefits from the experience of others, while maintaining full freedom of action and decisions, and observing absolute confidentiality.
It is an informal network of peers grounded in pooled knowledge and trust. The fact that CINDEX co-opts its members makes for a community with genuinely shared concerns.

Each young personhas a mentor in a company, and a representative in school.
The objective is to develop cultural and social awareness, a basic understanding of the professional world and educational perseverance and self-confidence.
Through the partnership, six Group employees volunteer their free time to mentor a young person over a one-year period, renewable.
The mentor helps the mentee to develop and to gain awareness of the professional and cultural world by providing the opportunities they deserve, on three levels:
Through cultural and sporting events (such as museum visits, theatre, sports matches) once a month
By sharing insight into the professional world, inviting the mentee to reflect on his own career and meeting other professionals
By encouraging the mentee person to be confident and aim to study to achieve their full potential.

On 27 July 2019, 90 employees of CMA CGM and their families met in La Boquera Huixquilucan in the State of Mexico and planted more than 2,000 trees over 4 hectares of deforested land.
APL Guam supports children with autism:
In October 2019, APL Guam employees participated in the first yoga course on the island especially designed for children with autism.
The objective was to encourage children to practice yoga as a way of improving their perception of themselves and their capabilities.

  CMA CGM employees involved in protecting the Calanques national park in Marseilles
As part of CMA CGM’s CSR month, the Group held an environmental event in partnership with the Calanques national park, a remarkably place of natural beauty near Marseilles. Created in 2012, it is the first national park close to a city, which is both land-based (8,500 hectares) and marine-based (43,500 hectares). Approximately 2 million people visit the park every year.
The objective of the collaboration between the Calanques national park and CMA CGM is to protect and enhance the value of the park’s natural heritage through employees’ involvement. Fifty employees from the head office participated in a clean-up initiative on the island where the lighthouse Phare du Planier is located. It is the first visible sign from the entrance of Marseilles and a historical landmark that needs to be protected.
Emergency assistance – natural
disasters
The CMA CGM Group provides coordinated assistance alongside public authorities and humanitarian organisations to people suffering from natural disasters, and to respond to immediate basic needs worldwide in times of crisis. CMA CGM’s teams provide logistics expertise for transporting material, and collect donations in kind (water, food, clothes), reflecting their commitment to improving the lives of people in extremely vulnerable situations and acting to help those most in need.
An illustrative selection of actions undertaken in 2019:
In March 2019, the coastal town of Beira in Mozambique was 90% destroyed by the cyclone Ida. The CMA CGM Group worked with the French Embassy and World Food Programme to transport emergency aid.
In October 2019, several regions in the Philippines were affected by a severe earthquake. More than 188,000 people lost their homes. CMA CGM Group employees acted to provide basic necessities in partnership with the non-governmental organisation Lingap Gabriela. CMA CGM Group facilitated the transport of materials free of charge (over land with CEVA Logistics and via maritime transport with CMA CGM).
    In December 2019, the CMA CGM Group launched the operation CMA CGM supports Lebanon to provide support through this period of economic and social trouble to the most disadvantaged people. The CMA CGM Group bought 35 tonnes of food products from local producers and two tonnes of medicines, which were given to 14 local non-governmental organisations. They were distributed through the volunteer participation of employees from CMA CGM and CEVA Logistics in Lebanon.

 Humanitarian Service Unit
At the end of 2017 CMA CGM decided to create a humanitarian service unit to provide a single contact point for international and non-governmental organisations. The unit provides tailored solutions to organisations working in emergency situations, facilitating aid by:
 Providing them with direct access to CMA CGM’s global network of agencies and services
 Centralising and streamlining assistance to provide specific transport solutions to meet their
requirements
 Providing professional advice from experienced Group experts on logistics issues
 Providing guidance on the transport of humanitarian aid supplies, via adapted transport systems
through reliable, safe, tailored end-to-end solutions at competitive prices
 Helping them to maximise the effect of the aid that they provide and contribute to finding solutions
to humanitarian crises
Since the Humanitarian service unit was set up, international and non-governmental organisations have praised the initiative and work daily with the unit to find adapted solutions. In 2019, the unit enabled the humanitarian transport of 11,069 TEU containers.

 NOTE METHODOLOGIQUE
METHODOLOGY
  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 156

Note: The scope of this Corporate Social Responsibility Report is the CMA CGM Group excluding CEVA Logistics, which was acquired by the Group in 2019. The process of integrating CEVA Logistics data into the business model, non-financial risk map and CSR reporting is underway. Consolidated data will be finalised in 2020 and will be disclosed in the 2020 CSR Report.
Note that the following information has been considered not applicable to the Group’s business activity:
 Fight against food insecurity
 Fight against food waste
 Protection of animal welfare
 Responsible, fair and sustainable food
Environment
The reporting period runs from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019.
Maritime fuel oil consumption: Fuel oil consumption is monitored for the entire fleet in operation. Fuel oil consumption for land activities is considered insignificant in comparison. Fuel oil consumption of maritime activity is expressed in tonnes of fuel oil and represents the total consumption of different types of fuel oil used by the fleet (HSFO / LSFO / MGO-DO)/ GNL) Q consumed per voyage = ∑ ROB beginning voyage – ROB end of voyage + ∑ voyage bunkers purchase.
Maritime carbon dioxide emissions: carbon dioxide emissions relate to the entire operated fleet and are expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide. They are directly calculated from fuel oil consumption. The following emission factors are applied to fuel oil consumption for maritime activity:
1 tonne HSFO = 3.114 tonnes of carbon dioxide
1 tonne LSFO = 3.151 tonnes of carbon dioxide
1 tonne MGO/ DO = 3.206 tonnes of carbon dioxide
1 tonne LNG = 2.75 tonnes of carbon dioxide
Ref: “RESOLUTION MEPC.245(66) 2014 GUIDELINES ON THE METHOD OF CALCULATION OF THE ATTAINED ENERGY EFFICIENCY DESIGN INDEX (EEDI) FOR NEW SHIPS”.
Les Carbon dioxide emissions/loaded TEU: Carbon dioxide emissions per loaded TEU is equal to the total direct emissions from the consumption of fuel by the CMA CGM fleet (scope 1 of the GHG protocol) divided by remunerated loaded TEUs (KPI 141).
Scope: CMA CGM Group fleet (owned and chartered vessels).
Definition of Scope 3:
Scope3 emissions are emissions resulting from ship- and container-building, on-board solid and liquid waste, employee business travel, fuel oil consumption before and after maritime shipping, and upstream bunker production and transport.
 Ship building: For each vessel built in the year, we consider the light displacement (excluding ballast, fuel, oil, cargo) in tonnes and we apply an emission factor of 1.75 (1.75
tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted to produce 1 tonne of
steel).
 Container building: For all the containers built during the
year on behalf of CMA CGM, we consider the empty weight (tare weight of a twenty-foot container = 2.2 tonnes) and we apply an emission factor of 1.75 (1.75 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted to produce 1 tonne of steel)
 Solid waste: Owned vessels take part in our Green Ship programme, and therefore report the amount of solid waste produced. We apply an emission factor of 182 kg of carbon dioxide per cubic metre of waste to the total volume of solid waste reported.
 Liquid waste: Mainly sludge produced by the vessel. For 2019, the estimated ratio of sludge to bunker fuel consumed was 2.36%, therefore we consider 2.36% of carbon dioxide produced.
 Employee business trips: The CMA CGM Group in-house travel agency reports carbon dioxide emissions stemming from trips (train/airplane) of the Group’s business travellers outbound from France. This corresponds to the Head Office scope.
 Fuel oil consumption before and after maritime shipping: We extract this information from the Group’s booking management system using a “transport mode” criterion that groups together shipping by external service providers (Barge / Rail / Road / Third-Party Feeder). We then apply the standard emission factors for each transport mode in order to calculate the corresponding carbon footprint. (Source: Carbon dioxide emission of transport services, Methodological Guide / French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, 2017 for rail, road and barge; CMA CGM source for third party feeder data).
 Upstream fuel production and transport emissions: we use the emission factors of the EcotransIT base which applies the default factors of the EN16258 standard. For MDO: 0.68 kg CO2e/kg. For HFO: 0.26 kg CO2e/kg. http://www.ecotransit.org/download/ETW_Methodology _Background_Report_2016.pdf (p. 96).
SOx emissions: SOx emissions cover the entire operated fleet and are expressed in tonnes of sulphur oxide. SOx emissions are calculated based on fuel oil consumption per type of fuel oil, the average sulphur content per type of fuel oil, and the emission factor of sulphur to SOx: 2 tonnes of SOx are emitted for per tonne of sulphur (S) in the fuel oil. (Source: EEMS Atmospheric Emissions Calculation).
An average sulphur content weighted by quantity is calculated for each type of fuel oil.
Note: where data is missing, the default sulphur content is reported.
NOx emissions: NOx emissions cover the entire operated fleet. NOx emissions for land activities are considered insignificant in comparison and are not consolidated at this time. NOx emissions are expressed in tonnes of nitrogen oxide.
       CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group
157

NOx = total fuel consumption by type * NOx emission factor by type of fuel
The following emission factors are applied to the fuel consumption for the maritime activity:
 HSFO/LSFO: 86 kg of NOx/tonnes of fuel oil
 DO: 56 kg of NOx/tonnes of fuel oil
(Source: Third IMO Greenhouse Gas Study 2014)
Spills: Spills are unintentional discharges of hazardous or non- hazardous effluent from the vessels, whether or not the CMA CGM Group is liable. The reporting scope pertains to the Group’s owned fleet and is based on feedback from the Report of Notification (RON) sent in by the vessels.
Solid waste: The volume of solid waste (hazardous and non- hazardous) is reported by ships through a waste reduction programme called “Green Ship”. Each vessel sends a summary of solid waste generated on board by category, based on the crew’s visual estimation. The quantity of waste is expressed in cubic metres or in pieces, depending on the category. These reports are then compiled and the figures analysed to determine the total volume of waste generated by the owned fleet. Sludge is not taken into account in this indicator.
Sludge: Sludge production covers the entire operated fleet and is expressed in tonnes. The quantity of sludge is calculated using a ratio that is calculated annually by the Sludge team based on the quantities discharged and inspected during sludge unloading operations. This ratio is applied to the total quantity of fuel oil burnt over the year in order to calculate the quantity of sludge produced.
Terminal water consumption: Terminal water consumption pertains to those terminals subject to the Corporate Terminals and Inland QHSSE policy, i.e. 68% in 2019 – 17 out of 25 terminals
2019 Scope of Terminals subject to the Corporate Terminals and Inland QHSSE policy: Malta Freeport Terminal Ltd., Somaport, Terminal Grand Ouest, Terminal des Flandres, Thessaloniki Port Authority S.A., Kingston Freeport Terminal Ltd., Adani CMA Mundra Terminal Pvt. Ltd, Kribi Container Terminal, Med Europe Terminal, Marseilles Manutention, HUB Océan Indien – SAMR, Brooklyn Kiev Port, Port of Iraq, Berth n°5, Baghdad Dry Port, Lattakia International Container Terminal, PROGECO Natal, PROGECO Fortaleza, Ridah Freezone Terminal, Terminal Maritima de Guadalquivir, CMA CGM Guadeloupe, CMA CGM Martinique, SOMARIG, APL Kaohsiung Container Terminal, APL Yokohama Terminal, Vietnam International Container Terminals, Dutch Harbour, Kodiak

Note 1: New hires are counted as the number of employees who joined the company between 1 January and 31 December of the reference year, depending on the contracts as defined in Note 1 / Workforce.
Someone is also considered a new hire in their company when they are reassigned, sign a new employment contract with a different company within the Group, or have an amendment to their original contract that results in a permanent assignment to a different Group company.
Note 2: Departures relate to the number of employees leaving the workforce at their own initiative or that of the company between 1 January and 31 December of the reference year, for employees under contract.
Percentage of women in managerial positions: number of women managers/total number of managers (men and women)
Training
Note 1: All types of training courses are included (internal and external) and all training methods (classroom, e- learning) are counted, as long as the training action contains an educational objective, is tracked and is administered by an employee of the CMA CGM Group.
 

Classroom-based training courses longer than one hour are counted. The calculation is based on the hours of training provided to employees and not the planned, scheduled or budgeted hours. Scope: France, USA, United Kingdom, Malaysia, China, Brazil, Estonia
E-learning courses (interactive content) are counted as from 4 minutes in length, and educational videos as from 30 seconds of connection. E-learning hours are tracked based on the hours completed, unless the connection time is illogical (i.e. more than twice the suggested time to completion and 1.25 for IMDG training). In this case, the suggested time to completion is reported. Scope: Global

French seafaring staff
The payroll tool specific to French Crewing is used to obtain all the HR data of French seafarers.
International seafaring staff
The workforce counted in the International Crewing HR indicators correspond to seafarers with a permanent employment contract or a contract with CMA CGM, any of its subsidiaries, CMA Ships Singapore and its agencies: these seafarers work on the vessels of the CMA CGM Group fleet, the vessels of other ship-owners, which carry out one-off jobs with other entities of the Group. If the shore-based assignment is definitive (via a change of contract), the employee is therefore counted in the office-based workforce. Staff in training and on leave are also counted. The nationalities of International Crewing are those declared by the seafarers in administrative paperwork.
French and International female naval officers: the status of officer in the Merchant Navy includes Deck Officers (composed of the ranks of Master, Chief Officer, Second Officer, Third Officer and Polyvalent Officer) and Engine Officers (composed of the ranks of Chief Engineer, Second Engineer, Third Engineer, Electrical Officer and Reeferman).
Training of French and international Crewing: The number of training hours for French and international seafaring personnel is the sum of e-learning training hours added to the number of classroom-based training hours:
 The number of classroom-based training hours is obtained by applying an average duration of 7 hours of training per day of training administered
 The number of e-learning training hours is obtained via the online training software
Health and Safety
Major maritime incident: Any maritime accident impacting personal health and safety (serious injury or death), the environment (national impact or with a recovery period of more than one year), the public image of the Group (accident covered by the international media) or with financial consequences exceeding €1 million.
Workplace safety: Fatal industrial accidents and accidents with leave longer than one day are tracked and consolidated at the Group level by CMA Ships, for the owned fleet maritime activity, and by SSE Terminals CMA CGM HO, for terminals under management.
Accidents that occurred on chartered vessels are not reported or consolidated, since they are under the liability of the ship owners.

Frequency of maritime industrial accidents: The frequency of industrial accidents is calculated for the maritime scope (fleet owned by CMA Ships) based on the number of accidents with sick leave and the total number of hours worked. It includes accidents among the seafaring staff employed by the Group, as well as the seafaring staff employed by manning agencies. An accident with leave is considered to be any accident that results in leave from work on board ship, of more than 24 hours in duration and on the basis of a medical opinion. Accidents resulting in leave only after disembarkation are not taken into account.
Number of shipping activity hours worked: sum of the actual number of days on board x 24 hours (corresponds to the number of hours per seafarer spent on board, including nights). Frequency = number of industrial accidents / (number of hours worked) x 1,000,000.
Severity scale of maritime industrial accidents: Number of days’ sick leave further to an industrial accident per thousand hours worked over a rolling period of twelve months. For seafaring staff no longer in the workforce as of 31/12/N, the days of leave which occurred during year N are not taken into account in the calculation of accident severity.
Frequency of accidents with bodily injury with sick leave for terminal employees:
The frequency is calculated over the scope of those terminals subject to the CMA CGM Terminals and Inland QHSSE policy based on the number of industrial accidents with sick leave of more than one day and the total number of hours worked. FR = (number of accidents / number of hours worked) x 1,000,000
2018 scope of Terminals subject to the CMA CGM HO Terminals and Inland QHSSE policy:
Dutch Harbor APL Terminal Unalaska / Kingston Freeport Terminal / SAMR La Réunion / GMM Martinique / GMG Jarry Terminal Guadeloupe / SOMARIG Guyane / TGO Montoir / TDF Dunkerque / BKP Odessa / Medeurope Terminal Marseille / Marseille Manutention / Malta Freeport Terminal / Terminal Sevilla / Thessaloniki / Lattakia / Umm Qasr Berth n°5 / Casablanca / Kribi / Mundra / Yokohama / Kaohsiung / VICT Vietnam / Natal

CSR challenges
The Group’s major CSR challenges were identified in partnership with various Group departments:
Environment, Security, Health & Safety, Human Resources, Ethics & Compliance, Procurement and Risk.
An initial list of material CSR challenges for the maritime transport sector was drawn up using a documentary and regulatory analysis.
The following challenges were identified:
 Business ethics: economic sanctions and embargoes, free competition, corruption, conflict of interests, fraud, data confidentiality and privacy
 Value chain: Customer Centricity and lasting partnerships with suppliers
 Social: diversity, gender equality and inclusion, employee working conditions, employee development
 Health, safety and security: maritime safety, occupational safety (H&S), cargo security, asset security, international security
 Environment: energy transition, resources, raw materials and waste, ocean biodiversity
 Society: territorial development and integration, sponsorship, local actions, philanthropy, Emergency Relief and the CMA CGM Foundation
Assessment of importance for CMA CGM
Each of the challenges determined is assessed by the various departments based on four criteria: finance, legal/regulatory, operation/ business, image/reputation. The challenges were then ranked by priority based on the following criteria:
+++: CMA CGM has identified the importance of this CSR challenge and has made it one of its priorities. The Group implements the necessary resources to address this challenge ++: CMA CGM has identified this CSR challenge as important and has set up related actions
+: CMA CGM has identified that this CSR challenge is not a priority for the moment and has implemented limited actions or has not set up any actions for the moment.
Assessment of importance for CMA CGM stakeholders
For this assessment, stakeholders were not directly contacted. Stakeholders were identified based on their influence on Group business. They are divided into two sub-groups:
Priority stakeholders: government, public authorities, investors, customers, shareholders, employees / trade unions, suppliers, subcontractors
Secondary stakeholders: NGOs, media,
organisations, local communities.
The challenges were then ranked by priority based on the following criteria:
+++: The stakeholder has determined that the CMA CGM CSR challenge is a fundamental challenge from its standpoint
++: The stakeholder has determined that the CMA CGM CSR challenge is secondary from its standpoint
+: The stakeholder has determined that the CMA CGM CSR challenge is not a priority for the moment from its standpoint
Note: In 2018, 95 Group and subsidiary employees gave their views on the CMA CGM CSR approach.

CSR risks
With support from the Risk Management Department, a CSR risk map relating to the materiality matrix is being prepared. The 2018 work involved:

-
-
-
If a given challenge falls into two risk categories, the final risk level is the higher of the two.
Comparing challenge assessments to risks. In this exercise, gaps were identified and explained as follows:
The importance of the challenge is higher than its risk: the challenge is considerable and known. CMA CGM has undertaken actions to limit the risk inherent to the challenge > Therefore, the risk is controlled, and the challenge remains considerable.
The importance of the challenge is less than its risk: the challenge is emerging. CMA CGM is implementing actions to mitigate the risk > Therefore, the risk is more important than the challenge itself, given the procedures and work underway.
  
-
Identifying the existing Group risks in connection with one of the 15Group CSR challenges and determining the challenges with no associated risks
Drafting the “CSR” risk map of risks and associated challenges. The rules applied are:
Depending on the business and scope, several risks are grouped into a “risk category”, for which the current risk level is defined by the average frequency and severity of the risk if it occurs.

On the basis of our work, our responsibility is to provide a report expressing limited assurance on:
55 Accreditation scope available at www.cofrac.fr CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group
 compliance of the Report with the requirements of article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;
 the fairness of the information provided in accordance with article R.225-105 I, 3° and II of the French Commercial Code, i.e., the outcomes, including key performance indicators, and the measures implemented to address the principal risks (hereinafter the “Information”).
Our responsibility is also to provide a report expressing, at the request of the entity and outside of the scope of accreditation, reasonable assurance that the information selected by the entity, presented in the Appendix and identified by the symbol √ in the Report has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.
It is not our responsibility to comment on the entity’s compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory requirements, such as the French due care law or on the compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations.
Nature and scope of our work
The work described below was performed in accordance with the provisions of Article A.225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, as well as with the professional guidance of the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes or CNCC) applicable to such engagements and with ISAE 300056:


associated with business relationships, products or services, as well as policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated with principal risks;
We referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:
assess the process used to identify and confirm the principal risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented;
substantiate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most significant presented in the Appendix. Concerning certain risks57, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity, for the other risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity and on a selection of entities58.
We verified that the Report covers the consolidation scope, i.e. all the consolidated entities in accordance with article L.233-16 of the French Commercial Code, within the limits set out in the Report;
We gained an understanding of the internal control and risk management procedures the entity has put in place and assessed the data collection process to ensure the completeness and fairness of the Information;
For the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most significant as presented in the Appendix, we implemented:
analytical procedures to verify the proper consolidation of the data collected and the consistency of any changes in those data;
tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the proper application of the definitions and procedures and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities4 and covers between 25% and 100% of the consolidated data selected for these tests;
We assessed the overall consistency of the Report based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.
We believe that the work carried out, based on our professional judgment, is sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.
Means and resources
Our work was carried out by a team of five people between November 2019 and March 2020 and took a total of eight weeks.
We were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. We conducted around fifteen interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Report.
Conclusion
Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the non- financial performance report is not presented in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.
Comment
Without modifying our conclusion and in accordance with article A. 225-3 of the French Commercial Code, we have the following matter to report:
With the exception of certain social data provided on the Group scope, the Report covers the Group scope excluding CEVA Logistics, an entity acquired during financial year 2019 and representing 55% of the Group's workforce. CEVA Logistics will be incorporated into the 2020 Non-Financial Performance Report, as mentioned in the appendix "Methodology" of the Management Report.

Inclusion
of the Sustainable Development Goals
– SDGs within the Group’s CSR approach
The UN Sustainable Development Goals have established the new course for businesses which, like CMA CGM, are acting responsibly and would like to take responsibility for their economic, social, societal and environmental impacts.
This list of 17 global goals includes the respect for human rights and fundamental free- doms, the fight against inequality and the pre- servation of the environment.
In 2018, CMA CGM measured its CSR approach against the 17 SDGs. The aim was to determine the extent to which the Group’s CSR approach was in line the UN programme. The results of these efforts are outlined in the introduction to each part of this document.
Group CSR materiality matrix
he materiality analysis3 was updated in order to rank the Group’s 15 CSR challenges. These challenges have been ranked based on priority both by taking into account the strategy of the Group and its subsidiaries and by incorporating the vision of its stakeholders.

CSR within CMA CGM 2018 Corporate Social ResponsIbility Report

The Group’s CSR risk mapping
With support from the Risk Management department, a CSR risk mapping was created in connection with the materiality matrix. The 2018 work involved:
- Firstly, identifying the existing mappings of the Group’s risks associated with each of the 15 CSR challenges and positioning each of these risks in a “CSR” risk mapping;
- Secondly, the challenges of the materiality matrix and the risks of the CSR risk mapping were measured against each other. This served to determine:
Risk management and mapping of the Group’s risks
Risk management is handled by the Corporate Risk Management and Internal Audit Department. The Risk Management team implements a Corporate level approach under the impetus of Top Management, with contribution from the various business lines. The methodology is based on a qualitative assessment carried out at a given time and projected over a year.
The Group’s risk mapping and the micro risk mappings per business line / function are based on two criteria:
- Probability of occurrence of the risk;
- Severity of the impacts of the risk.
• The challenges without associated risks. Efforts are underway to conduct analyses of the missing risks;
• Whether the positioning of each risk was similar to or differed from the challenges. In this exercise, differences were identified and explained.
To date, the following CSR-related risks have been identified:
- Risk of non-compliance with “ethics and compliance” regulations especially regarding: competition, corruption, economic sanctions and personal data protection
- Risks in partnerships with our suppliers and subcontractors
- Breach of human rights
- Improper working conditions
- Poor health & safety management
- Poor security management
- Uncontrolled climatic change
performance
- Scarcity of materials waste production
- Uncontrolled pollution
- Harm to biodiversity
and
uncontrolled
The CSR and Environment Department reports to General Management and is tasked with:
• Implementing the CSR policy in line with
all of the Group’s policies;
• Identifying stakeholder’s CSR issues,
priorities and expectations;
• Setting CSR goals and coordinating the
CSR action plans;
•Assessing, measuring and reporting on
the CSR performance.
A CSR dashboard has been established to measure and steer the Group’s sustainable development performance, through a series of quantitative and qualitative indicators which are consolidated on a half-yearly basis. – cf. page 110 Table of Indicators.
The exhaustiveness and reliability of the data, which increases from year to year, is guaranteed by indicator sheets describing in particular the collection and consolidation scope and processes. An extract of these indicator sheets is included in the “Methodological Note” section of this document. – cf. page 114 Methodological Note.
18
Steering of CSR
 CSR reporting is coordinated by the CSR Department. The data from the “CSR Dashboard” is checked by an Independent Third-Party Organisation every year. The report from this Independent Third-Party Organisation is appended hereto. – cf. page 107 Report by one of the Statutory Auditors Analysing the trends of these indicators serves to quantify the impact of the policies implemented, identify the thrusts for growth and determinine and/or adjust the goals and action plans for the year in progress and in the medium term. – cf. page 107 CSR Goals, 2018 achievements, 2019 action plans
A CSR Committee meets on a quarterly basis to analyse the “CSR Dashboard”, didentify the strategic thrusts driven by Top Management and determine the appropriate course of action. This Committee is made up of members from departments such as Human Resources, Risk Management and Internal Audit, Compliance, Finance, Communication and Marketing, and the network of agencies, Purchasing, Transformation and Innovation, Security, Safety and Environment, the Lines as well as CMA Ships, the CMA CGM Foundation and subsidiaries.
It is also worth noting that specific “business line” or “project” Committee meetings are held in parallel and more operational working groups are set up at a greater frequency.
At the same time, an expanding network of CSR officers has been established.
The Group’s CSR performance recognised by EcoVadis
CMA CGM communicates about its CSR approach both within and outside the company. Moreover, in our efforts to extend our CSR policy beyond the mere regulatory requirements, every year, the Group voluntarily submits its CSR performance for assessment by EcoVadis.
With a GOLD rating in 2018, CMA CGM ranks amongst the top 1% of companies assessed by EcoVadis worldwide.
Furthermore, in 2018, the Silver Sustainability Award was bestowed upon CMA CGM by Nike to recognise its sustainable development commitment.

   As an expert in logistics, a core business of the Group, CMA CGM must be exemplary at all stages of its value chain. As a matter of fact, with over 30,000 suppliers and 65,000 customers worldwide, CMA CGM innovates and imagines the goods shipping solutions of the future by developing:
• Innovation & digital transformation to serve operational performance;
• Customer satisfaction: improving the customer experience at all stages of the process; • Responsible procurement: establishing a lasting and efficient relationship with suppliers and subcontractors.
1. Innovation & digital transformation to enhance performance
A dedicated organisation
Digital transformation is a strategic goal for the Group. It includes both improving the Group’s performance and enhancing the service provided to customers.
The Group relies on 3 elements as a means of concretelybringingaboutthistransformation:
1. Several dedicated teams
(Digital Office, Transformation, Digital Factory, Data) to achieve the digital transformation of the Group. Their common aim is to initiate new projects, prove their concept and commercial value, develop the best of these projects and ease their implementation within the Group’s business lines at an international scale.
2. Our digital strategy is built on 5 strengths which will transform the shipping sector over the next 10 years and which will help to answer to the following 5 questions:
23
4 NYSHEX: leader on the digital market for sea freight contracts.
5 E-dray: software aimed at improving the container shipping operations.
• How can we remain relevant in an constantly changing industry?
• How can we continuously and efficiently optimise the management of operations? • How can we optimise our rates and
volumes for our customers?
•How can we foster customer loyalty
through a tailored customer experience?
• How can we provide the Group’s employees
with the tools to do their jobs better?
3. An investment fund called CMA CGM Ventures, which invested in a dozen start-up in France and abroad. The goal is to support the growth of these start-up internationally, while allowing them to draw from the CMA CGM ecosystem and the expertise of all employees. In most cases, these are start- up with which the Group has developed operational partnerships (Nyshex4 , e-dray5 , Traxens) so that they can continue over the long term.

  SmartPort Challenge
As part of the SmartPort Challenge, the Group tasked start-up with imagining the port of the future and particularly with optimising container logistics: Optimisation of Gate Out by Trucks.
The SmartPort Challenge was initiated by the Marseilles Provence Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Aix Marseilles University and the Grand Port Maritime de Marseilles with a view to further enhancing the existing port ecosystem in France. CMA CGM decided to champion this innovative approach by becoming a partner of this project alongside 6 other major international groups.
In October 2018, Rajesh Krishnamurthy, Senior Vice-President of IT, presented the challenge to the start-up :
“This challenge stemmed from a simple and operational observation: shipping is very competitive and one major issue for the industry’s players is the optimisation of container flows, as several steps are required for the timely departure of the container from the terminal [...]. The aim of this challenge is to improve the supply chain so as to provide the best possible service to customers and reflect the CMA CGM Group’s overall digitalisation policy.”
Start-up had until late 2018 to submit their projects. The selected candidates will be able to test and implement their solutions for a period of 3 months in early 2019 within The Camp and will be presented with a € 15,000 grant.
and to attract start-up from all around the world to this incubator. This ambitious incubation project was launched with a view to addressing several key issues:
• Encouraging boldness and innovation;
• Taking an active part in the economic buoyancy of the Provence Alpes Côte
d’Azur region;
• Creating optimum conditions for innovation
within the shipping sector;
• Accelerating the Group’s digital transformation; • Assisting in the emergence of a specialised
innovation ecosystem in particular in the area of logistics.
This project will build on the various initiatives developed by CMA CGM in the region:
• Support of “Carburateur”, a business
incubator located in the Northern districts of Marseilles and created with support from public authorities;
• Partnership with Aix Marseilles French Tech; • Partnership with The Camp, an innovative campus bringing together major corpo- rations, start-up, professors and researchers – cf page 62 – Fostering creative cooperation with The Camp;
• Partnerships with global IT leaders such as IBM and Infosys.
ZEBOX
ZEBOX is an international start-up incubator and accelerator that was created in Marseilles in 2018 by Rodolphe Saadé, Chief Executive Officer of the CMA CGM Group. It works in areas such as transport, logistics, mobility and X.0 industry.
As part of its incubation programme, ZEBOX hosts 15 start-up for a period of 12 to 18 months. An acceleration programme will be launched in early 2019 and will make it possible to host 8 start-up for a period of 8 months.
The driving objective is to become a world benchmark for innovation: artificial intelligence, blockchain, virtual reality / augmented reality, ecosystem of connected objects, cybersecurity, robotics, etc.
ZEBOX has three goals:
• Guiding the success of the start-up with
projects developed based on cutting-
edge core technologies such as artificial
intelligence, blockchain, the ecosystem
of connected objects and robotics by 25 immediately steering them towards
international perspective;
• Fostering open innovation by establishing
arrangements between major corporations and the start-up so that they can innovate together;
• Creating a genuine network of business and cooperation opportunities by establishing solid partnerships with the various ecosystems and prominent figures in innovation worldwide.
The support provided is customised to match the needs of each independent business as it is prepared with a dedicated, expert and human- centric ZEBOX team. Sector experts and the ZEBOX mentor network thereby provide the start-up with assistance on a daily basis.
The start-up hosted by ZEBOX can draw on a solid network of partners; French and international corporations from various complementary sectors including CMA CGM, the founding Corporate partner of ZEBOX, and Accenture, BNP Paribas, Centrimex and EY. This network of partners provide the start-up with valuable business expertise and grant them access to exceptional resources including experts, technologies, the possi- bility of completing proofs of concept, busi- ness opportunities, international network, capital-risk, business angels, etc., thereby fostering their development.

In 2018, the transformation launched some 45 projects and partnerships, such as:
BLUEBOX: first in-house innovation competition
BlueBox is a virtual suggestion box to promote innovation and creativity for digital transformation. “Digital technology plays a pivotal role in the company’s transformation through its agility, simplification and especially the collaborative applications”, explained Thierry Billion, Senior Vice- President and sponsor of the Digital Culture theme.
Three themes were selected to guide the employees’ ideas:
• Customer Focus;
• Operational Experience; • Digital Culture.
This virtual suggestion box was a resounding success given that:
• 379 ideas were deposited into the Bluebox; • 60% of the Head Office employees took
part in the competition by offering ideas, voting for or commenting on their favourite ideas.
The 3 selected projects subsequently took part in the Design Thinking phase. For 3 days and based on collaborative workshops, the various groups refined their ideas, determined the user needs as well as the issues in order to achieve a design draft and a description of the various desired functionalities.
Key partnerships signed

The annual survey carried out in late 2017 was used to gather the opinions of over 23,000 customers in 180 countries. Based on these results, CMA CGM carried out a more thorough analysis of customer expectations via 1,700 interviews conducted in 2018. Service indicators have been established on this basis and dashboards are now used to give customers greater visibility. They therefore fall within a process of continued improvement. This approach was supported by a Customer Journey Mapping carried out with 11 customers.
New initiatives have been launched:
• CMA CGM invested in a new multi-channel
customer contact centre. It is fundamental 27 to ensure consistency between the various
channels and this will benefit employees
by lightening their work load and
improving the quality of service provided.
In 2019, this tool will be integrated into
the e-commerce platform and will include
a self-service function. The first pilots were
conducted in 2018 in 4 countries. This
phase preceded a plan for global roll-out
in the shared services agencies and centres
to ensure end-to-end service quality.
• To enhance the Group’s digital transfor- mation, which will provide interested customers with a fully digital service in 2019, CMA CGM also added twenty new features to its e-commerce solution throughout 2018. These include online payment (gradually implemented in each country), new simplified customer dashboards with a self-service reporting module, new operational notifications regarding the transported goods, a shipment geo-tracking tool, a dynamic online support, the provision of all inland rates, etc. Other features will be rolled out in 2019, such as the Geo schedule, instant booking confirmation, electronic B/L, etc.
2. Customer satisfaction: improving the customer experience at each step of the journey
The “Customer Centricity” goal is a key strategic priority of the Group. Within this context, a programme to improve the customer experience was launched to allow CMA CGM to:
• Meet new customer expectations; • Stand out from competitors with an
innovative range of services;
• Capitalise on its closeness to customers.
Rodolphe Saadé, Chief Executive Officer of the CMA CGM Group, has set all his teams the goal of becoming the No. 1 shipping line of its customers.
The CMA CGM Group chose the TPM6 conference to present its new “Customer Centricity” strategy and also introduced the Customer Experience programme driven by a powerful ambition: “Caring beyond Shipping”, working closely with our customers.
Therefore, CMA CGM prepared an ambitious transformation plan which will improve all of its interactions with its customers. This involves changes to the internal structure, an acceleration of the training programmes and new digital tools.
Customer satisfaction is a core concern of CMA CGM and as such the company has committed to improving its service quality, through the performance of annual customer surveys and the establishment of the Customer Charter defined in 2015.
6 The TPM conference, organised by the Journal of Commerce, is one of the shipping sector’s most important events.
Over 2,000 vistors attended the eighteenth edition held in Long Beach, USA, from 04 to 07 March 2018, including some of our biggest customers.

28
In addition, as a means of providing further support to customers in the development of their business, CMA CGM has created new value-adding innovative services. Through this strategy, the company can specifically address customer needs, thereby making CMA CGM a key partner in their logistics chain.
In 2018, 6 new value-adding products were launched:
• Traxens: the smart container. As a matter of fact, the containers are series- equipped with top-of-the-line connected technologies, serving to transmit data, almost in real time, regarding the position (geographic location, etc.) and condition of the goods (temperature, impact detection, etc.). Therefore, the customer benefits from
Specific training courses are organised per region to provide sales teams with the necessary expertise regarding these products.
Moreover, other actions implemented for customers were recognised during 2018. Below are a few examples:
procurement: establishing
better traceability and cost optimisation
tools;
• Cargo Value SERENITY: the first product
3. Sustainable
 of the SERENITY range intended to compensate for unforeseen events during goods transport;
a lasting relationship
•Reeflex:anewtechnologicalsystemforthe transportation of liquids via a bag installed in a container;
with suppliers and
• Climactive : controlled atmosphere tech- nology, which maintains products’ fresh- ness up to destination by more rapidly re- ducing the oxygen level within a container;
CMA CGM places fundamental importance in establishing a stable and long-lasting relationship with its suppliers. To this end, the Group, purchasing advisors, suppliers and subcontractors work in close cooperation for this purpose.
The adoption of the Sapin II Law and the law on the duty of care of parent companies and contracting authorities has led the Group to strengthen its oversight mechanism in relation to the fight against corruption, respect for human rights and the fight against environmental impairment related with its business activity. – cf. page 35 Compliance with requirements of the Sapin II Law. Strategically, the Group has opted to conduct this work simultaneously and in accordance with a unique methodology in order to foster the adoption and implementation thereof.
The establishment of a Supplier Risk Committee
During 2017, the Group created a Supplier Risk Committee in order to enhance the coordination of procurement risks within the Group and to monitor the actions put in place. In addition to all the operational representatives from the purchasing department, this Committee aggregates the key stakeholders working in the relevant areas of expertise (Legal, Compliance, Audit and Risk, Human Resources and CSR departments). Within this context, the Group has put in place the action plans regarding the regulatory changes involving suppliers.
The Third-Party Code of Conduct to strengthen its responsible approach
cf. page 36 The Group’s compliance policies. In 2014, the CMA CGM Group created a Partner Charter which outlines all of the Group’s CSR commitments and obligations as well as the expectations for its suppliers and subcontractors. Therefore, the suppliers consulted during calls for tenders and those awarded contracts via other methods must sign this Partner Charter
before any agreement is made.
This charter is systematically included in the contracts. To strengthen its approach and promote responsible behaviour amongst suppliers, the CSR contractual clauses are added in the contracts and General Purchasing Conditions.
Mapping of procurement risks as a corner- stone
In 2018, a mapping of “procurement risks” was implemented at Group level, with the risk assessment methodology used being that applied by the Group’s Risk Management department. – cf. page 18 Risk management and mapping of the Group’s risks.
This mapping of “procurement risks”:
• Outlines the purchasing areas and regions; • Assesses the risks in terms of corruption, economic sanctions, human rights, health
& safety, the environment, etc;
• Classifies the risks into segments associated
with a given category of suppliers and
intermediaries;
• Determines the action plans to reduce the
risk level.
The establishment of a supplier and subcontractor assessment system to enhance the steering of procurement risks An overall supplier and intermediary assessment system has been established and covers the aforementioned main risks. Since January 2018, the Group’s Central Purchasing Department has worked, with support from an outside consulting firm, on developing a specific procedure aimed at strengthening the steering of supplier risks. This procedure relies on a classification of the purchasing categories based on three risk levels (High, Medium, Low).

 The criteria used to assess the risk level are as follows:
- Location: the countries in which the supplier operates
- The level of sensitivity of the supplier’s business activity with regard to the compliance risk
The enhanced comprehensive supplier and intermediary assessment system will be implemented in 2019 under the supervision of the Group’s Central Purchasing Department, initially with a pilot period of 3 months before being gradually rolled out to the entire Group. The aim is to harmonise the various practices and to have a common procedure applied at Group level.
 30
The assessment system consists of 5 steps: ➊ The “pre-qualification“, this step
is aimed at identifying the suppliers and intermediaries at greatest risk. It is achieved with a tool that relies on country- specific indices regarding corruption, ethics, environment and type of activity.
➋ The “risk-assessment” step, includes the systematic sending of an assessment questionnaire to all suppliers and intermediaries. This questionnaire contains several sections with the following themes: general information, financial elements, fight against corruption, economic sanctions, human rights, health & safety, the environment, etc. This assessment questionnaire was developed with the assistance of all the relevant support functions of the company (Legal, CSR, Finance, Purchasing, etc.), and is enhanced by feedback.
The whole of this information is recorded in a single qualification report per supplier.
➌ The third step is the “analysis” step. It is carried out at a 1st level by the purchasers of the various relevant areas. In the event of a more thorough 2nd-level analysis, the purchaser will call on the support division of the Centrale Purchasing Department. Finally, for the complex cases or cases which have not been resolved by the
support division, a 3rd level of analysis will be conducted, with the involvement of the CMA CGM support functions (finance department, legal/compliance department, CSR department).
In 2019, the purchasers will receive training and guidance in order to quickly identifty the areas for improvement and thereby develop progress plans with the suppliers.
➍ The fourth step is the “Qualification” step and depends on the overall grade received by the supplier and the level of priority:
- For the suppliers who obtain an above
average grade per area (approx. 60%), a standard qualification is issued and is valid for 4 years;
- For suppliers between 25% and the previous threshold, a 2-year qualification is issued;
- For suppliers below 25%, a 1-year quali- fication is issued.
➎ The last step, the “Monitoring” step, is used to carry out watch and take advantage of a dynamic system. As a matter of fact, given the fast-moving and ever-changing market, each supplier qualification may be reassessed under the following cases:
- Legal change of the supplier entity;
- Changes in the market environment (finan-
cial, legal, CSR problems, etc.);
- At the end of the qualification period
(mentioned above);
- In the event of changes to the contract.
The establishment of monitoring indicators as part of a continued improvement approach
To measure the efficiency of the implemented actions, 5 monitoring indicators have been iden- tified and cover the main procurement risks.
• % of suppliers which signed the Partner Charter; • Number of assessed suppliers;
• Average score of the companies assessed
by EcoVadis;
• Average score of the companies assessed
by CMA CGM with Cscreen; • Ratio of suppliers at risk.
The pilot period will help to obtain a refe- rence point and define the required adjust- ments. These monitoring indicators will be disclosed in the next report on non-financial information.
31
The “Business hold” concept
Should, after being qualified, a supplier represent a heightened risk in particular regarding the anti-corruption or human rights theme, its status may be considered as “Business hold”. In this case, the purchaser will carry out a more thorough investigation into the issue. If it is confirmed, the management
board may ask the supplier in question to immediately prepare a full report on the incident, the potential consequences and the corrective action plans. The management board may decide to suspend certain activities for a given period or decide on more appropriate actions.

Code of Ethics: CMA CGM’s Foundation document
Updated or created Code
of Ethics, Partner Charter, Anti-Corruption Code, Gifts & Hospitality Policy, Third-Party Assessment Policy, Conflict
of Interest Policy, Interest representation Policy

32
The Code of Ethics is the centerpiece of CMA CGM’s com- mitment to upholding the highest standards of business ethics, personal integrity and compliance in all of its bu- siness activities.
The Code of Ethics is applied worldwide to all legal enti- ties, subsidiaries, affiliates, partnerships, joint ventures and other business associations directly or indirectly controlled by CMA CGM. The CMA CGM Partner Charter contains the main principles of the Code of Ethics, and is intended for third parties.
The Code of Ethics applies to all individuals worldwide wor- king for CMA CGM, regardless of their management level, particularly the executive officers, managers and employees.
The Code of Ethics is available in French, English, Arabic, Spanish and Mandarin. In 2018, the Code of Ethics was updated to take into account the changes which occurred regarding the fight against corruption, compliance with economic sanctions, competition law and personal data protection.

CMA CGM has continued its efforts to strengthen its anti-corruption compliance programme by adhering to the requirements of the Sapin II Law (A) as well as revising or creating specific Compliance procedures for the Group (B) while taking part in joint actions with other shipping players (C).
1. Business Ethics and Anti-Corruption
A. Compliance with requirements of the Sapin II Law
In 2018, the Group continued to develop an anti-corruption programme including the eight pillars of the French anti- corruption law, known as the Sapin II Law. This anti-corruption programme includes:
•The introduction of an Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct, forming an integral part of the Binding Corporate Rules of companies established in France and concurrent updating of the Code of Ethics. The Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct contains rules applicable to the fight against corruption and influence peddling and the disciplinary sanctions in the event of breach;
• The generalisation of a whistleblowing platform (Ethics Hotline) intended to gather reports from employees and third parties concerning the existence of conduct or situations that conflict with the Group’s ethical rules;
• The performance of a Sapin II risk mapping under the responsibility of the Group’s Risk Management Department, geared towards identifying, assessing, ranking and
managing the corruption risks to which the Group is exposed. It also serves to report to Top management and the persons in charge of Compliance, the information needed to establish measures to prevent and detect the risks of corruption that are appropriate for the identified challenges;
• The strengthening and updating of the procedures (due diligence) to assess the compliance situation of CMA CGM’s partners, intermediaries, suppliers and customers;
• The introduction of internal and external accounting check procedures to ensure that the ledgers, registers and financial statements are not used to conceal acts of corruption or influence peddling;
• The updating of a classroom-based and e-learning training system intended for the execustives and staff who are most exposed to the risks of corruption and influence peddling;
• The performance of an assessment of the anti-corruption compliance system carried out by the Internal Audit Department.

B. The Group’s compliance policies
In 2018, the CMA CGM Group revised and created various Ethics and Anti-Corruption policies. These policies form part of the Group’s compliance programme and contribute to the application of the Sapin II Law.
The Code of Ethics, as mentioned in the introduction, applies to the entire CMA CGM Group.
The Third-Party Code of Conduct is intended for all “Business Partners”, i.e. all individuals or organisations which/who do business with CMA CGM, in particular the suppliers, intermediaries, dealers, distributors, subcontractors, consultants and joint ventures. Our Business Partners are required to join the Partner Charter. They are expected to strictly adhere to CMA CGM Partner Charter or equivalent rules of behaviour. – cf. page 29 The Third- Party Code of Conduct to strengthen its responsible approach
In 2018, pursuant to the Sapin II Law, and following consultation with the Staff Representative Bodies (CE, CHSCT, CCE) and DIRECCTE, CMA CGM launched the Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct. The Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct is included in the Binding Corporate Rules of all CMA CGM companies located in France.
In 2018, the Group revised its Gifts and Hospitality Policy. Whenever they are not reasonable, gifts, meals, travel, accommodation, marketing or recreational events can be considered as bribes. As a result, all CMA CGM Group employees must display honesty and transparency in these areas, so that their behaviour is not construed in any respect as the acceptance or the offering of a bribe.
The Gifts and Hospitality Policy describes the acceptable and prohibited behaviours.
In 2018, the Group also revised its Conflict of Interest Policy. This policy involves an annual conflict of interest disclosure statement which is mandatory for all persons considered as “key people” and a list of whom is included in the appendix. The 2018 Conflict of Interest Policy has expanded the list of key people subject to this mandatory annual disclosure statement. All other CMA CGM Group employees must make a disclosure statement whenever they are faced with a potential risk of conflict of interest. Furthermore, in 2018, with the introduction of the Ethics Hotline, the conflict of interest disclosure statements must be made via this new system. However, an alternative procedure is planned for employees who do not have access to the Internet. These changes are included in the new Conflict of Interest Policy initiated in 2018.
In 2018, the CMA CGM Group worked on the development of an Interest Representatives Policy. This policy will take effect in January 2019. The Interest Representatives Policy lays down the applicable code of conduct and ethical rules and specifies a “due diligence” procedure before CMA CGM hires any interest representative.
The CMA CGM Group has also developed
a compliance “due diligence” procedure applicable to third parties with whom CMA CGM intends to develop a business relationship. Given the sectors in which it operates, CMA CGM has business relationships with many third parties (customers, suppliers, subcontractors, intermediaries, brokers, co-investors, etc.). By exercising vigilance regarding the integrity of the third parties with which it does business, CMA CGM is acting to enforce its anti-corruption policy.
C. The Group’s actions to guarantee compliance within the shipping industry
Since March 2014, the Group has been a member of the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network, which is fighting to eliminate corruption in the shipping and port sectors. The Maritime Anti-Corruption Network is a global business network working towards the development of a maritime industry free of corruption that enables fair trade to the benefit of society at large.
The MACN
In 2018, the network had over 100 members from the maritime industry. The secretariat of the MACN is based in Copenhagen and is carried out by BSR, a Non-Governmental Organisation. Its responsibility is to advance the initiatives and actions of MACN and it produces various tools or communications that are made available to the members.
    The work of the MACN is structured around three core areas:
    36
    COLLECTIVE ACTION
Working with governments, non-governmental organisations and civil society to identify and mitigate the root causes of corruption and improving
the operational environment.
STRENGTHENING CAPACITIES
Assisting member companies in implementing the MACN anti-corruption principles, developing tools and sharing best practices within the network.
INTEGRITY CULTURE
Raising awareness of the challenges faced and heightening the standards of integrity within the maritime community.

 2. Economic sanctions
• Close link with the geopolitical context • Need to comply with European
and American regulations
As a leading French player in maritime shipping, CMA CGM must carry out its business by complying with regulations regarding economic sanctions.
Leveraging on a dedicated team within the Legal Department and by raising the awareness of each employee to these problems, CMA CGM has embarked upon a security and compliance approach.
The ever-changing requirements in this area call for constant monitoring of regulatory developments, close cooperation with the relevant national and international authorities as well as empowerment of all staff through access to an interactive platform allowing them to understand the guidelines and good practices in the business activities involving the countries and exports at risk.
Moreover, CMA CGM has enhanced its approach for compliance with economic sanctions via a training programme with e-learning modules made available to each employee and newcomer, as well as classroom training sessions.
38
3. Competition
The CMA CGM Group has made it its top priority to ensure that its employees know and comply with competition law. At the end of the maritime conferences in Europe in 2008, the Group developed a competition law compliance programme designed to guarantee that all the business activities of the Group’s entities and subsidiaries in France and worldwide comply with competition law. The programme applies to all Group employees, especially in connection with their relationship with customers, competitors, partners and suppliers.
This programme has led inter alia to the creation of a division of legal practitioners specialised in competition law within the Group’s Legal Department and to the delivery of many classroom and online training courses.
Following the delivery of an e-learning programme from 2008 to 2018 which helped to train tens of thousands of employees in France and abroad, the Competition Law Compliance division of the Group’s Legal Department developed a new general competition e-learning module based on a more interactive format and which includes the differences in the legal systems of the foreign companies acquired by the Group over time.
This online training module is supplemented by tailor- made classroom training sessions for certain categories of employees, subsidiaries and entities of the Group.
4. Personal data protection
For the past several years, CMA CGM has embarked upon a personal data protection policy within its information systems.
CMA CGM implements the organisational and technical means to protect the personal data of data subjects (customers, suppliers, employees, third parties) and extends its compliance policy to subcontractors and subsidiaries to guarantee compliance with the European personal data protection standard worldwide. The enforcement of this policy is supported by:
• An intra-Group data protection policy;
• A network of Data Protection Officers –
DPO;
• An Audit Plan;
• A training plan for employees.
The Data Protection Officer (DPO) appointed by the Group ensures that this personal data protection policy is properly enforced.
5. Compliance:
a company culture achieved through raising awareness and training of all employees
The dissemination of the Compliance culture within the Group is achieved via various methods:
> The dissemination of the policies over the Intranet: the documents comprising the Group’s Compliance programme can be consulted by all employees on the Group’s Intranet, on a dedicated page. This page aggregates all the Group’s Policies and Procedures and tools for all employees such as interactive charts to identify the countries subject to economic sanctions. At the same time, the “Ethics and Compliance” space on the www.cma-cgm.fr website provides all individuals with the Code of Ethics, the Partner Charter and outlines our various Ethics and Compliance policies.
> Employee training. Training is also a key element in the Group’s Compliace policy:
• Guidance is offered for all the Group’s employees via classroom courses taught at the head office and in the regions. These courses are renewed on a regular basis and are intended for those employees who are most exposed to Compliance risks irrespective of their geographical location;
•e-learning modules on Compliance are compulsory for Group’s employees and are regularly updated. In 2018, two new e-learning modules were introduced, one entitled “Introduction to personal data protection” on European Competition Law and another entitled “Fighting corruption”;
• All new employees receive support in their compliance training. Firstly, they are required to sign the Code of Ethics online before starting their employment contract. They then receive a reminder email concerning all the e-learning modules on compliance that they are required to take. Finally, as of December 2019, a member of the Compliance Department will briefly explain to new employees the Department’s actions during the various orientation sessions.
39
At the same time, a good practices guideline, memos and regular publications on competition law news are broadly disseminated within the Group.
In the event of doubt, employees are strongly encouraged to consult the Competition Compliance division of the Legal Department or its local officers worldwide to ensure that their actions are compliant.
Any breach by an employee to the competition rules may be reported via the professional whistleblowing platform “Ethics Hotline”.
Suppliers and service providers from whom the Group purchases goods and services are also required to comply with the Group’s policy relating to competition law.
Finally, the Group implements specific measures when it acquires companies or creates joint ventures with partners in order to adhere to the competition rules applicable to these economic transactions.
> "Tone at the top": lManagers must set the example and ensure that the projects that they supervise are handled ethically and comply with the Code of Ethics and applicable laws.
> Adaptation of the compliance approach based on the perceived risk: the sectors at risk of non-compliance should be highlighted by correlating the compliance efforts to the sectors where the risk of non-compliance is the highest based on our risk mapping.

6. A whistleblowing system: Ethics Hotline
The reporting of potential or proven breaches to laws, regulations, policies or procedures of the Group are embodied in the Code of Ethics and encourages accountability amongst the Group’s employees in their commitment to ethical conduct.
CMA CGM provides employees and third parties with a website: http://cma-cgm.ethicspoint.com
which allows them to:
• Ask questions to the Compliance Department;
• Make a report via an online form;
•Make a report via a dedicated phone number (the phone numbers are listed per country and are available on the Group’s
website or on the intranet);
•Ensure that whistleblowers remain
anonymous, if they so desire and if the
local regulations so allow; • Access to a 24/7 platform.
As of 2019, the Ethics Hotline system will be used to gather statistics in terms of the reports made.
Suppliers
& subcontractors
The introduction of this new system will also go in hand with new policies, such as the Non-Retaliation Policy intended to remind employees of CMA CGM’s commitment to protecting whistle-blowers who make reports in good faith of a potential breach to the law or internal policies.
As such, all employees are encouraged to use any means to report, by any method, to Top Management, their line managers or the Group Compliance Department and/or by any other existing channel, any breach to the Code of Ethics, the compliance policies as well as the applicable procedures and regulations, irrespective of their area and particularly:
• Fraud and/or corruption; •Anti-competitionpractices;
• Respect for human rights;
• And generally any potential breach to the
Group’s Code of Ethics or Policies.
7. Duty of care – Vigilance Plan
In 2017, as soon as the law on the duty of care by parent companies and large corporations was voted, a cross-functional and multi- disciplinary work group involving the CSR, Risk Management and Purchasing divisions was created to meet the 5 requirements of the law.
Their first tasks, to best enforce the Law on the Duty of Care, were to:
41
Human rights & fundamental liberties
Health, Safety & Security
Environment
Note:
detailed progress of the actions carried out as part of the vigilance plan is presented in the following pages.
They will be analysed during 2019. The effectiveness of these actions will be presented in the 2019 CSR Report.
 • Identify all the actions undertaken by the Group regarding health, safety, the environment and social aspects;
• Identify the scope and breakdown the Group’s business activities;
• Within the company: office-based activities, operational, maritime and terminal activities;
• Outside the company: suppliers and subcontractors.

2. Diversity
The strength of the CMA CGM Group lies in the diversity of the Men and Women working there. Diversity plays a fundamental role in guiding the Group’s strategy. As a source of inspiration and innovation, it helps us to better understand customer expectations, and to offer them tailored transport solutions and high-quality services. The diversity within the Group is defined by gender equality, multi-culturalism, and intergenerationality in order to foster emulation to enable mutual enrichment.
The CMA CGM Group strives to give everyone the same opportunities so they can avance in the organisation. Our Code of Ethics clearly explains our aim to expand diversity and equal opportunity. We derive our integrity by respecting and protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms as instituted in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Through this declaration, we have committed to eliminating any discrimination of any kind, based on nationality, class, race, disability, gender, age, religion and political views.
More broadly, the Group’s anti-discrimination policy is based on the principles of freedom of opinion, job placement and retention for disabled employees and job equality as per the collective bargaining agreement. As such, many projects have been put in place and continuous talks are underway between the personnel representative bodies and management to address more in-depth areas of action for the labour climate and the work environment in general.
In May 2017, the CMA CGM Group created the “Diversity for a better performance” committee.
The goal of this Committee is to make diversity a source of performance for the Group and is structured around 3 areas of focus:
INTERCULTURALITY
to improve understanding of different foreign partners' culture and thus encourage exchanges
INTERGENERATIONALITY
to develop knowledge and the transfer of skills between the different generations
GENDER EQUALITY
to feminise the Group's image and reduce t he status gap between men and women

Within the Group, the average age of

In 2018, the Group celebrated its 40th 47 anniversary, it is partly due to the diverse
profiles and ages of its employees that the Group has acquired such a solid foundation.

            The upward trend in the number of seafarers can be explained by the slight increase in vessels as well as an adjustment of the calculation methods.
In 2018, the workforce increased in Asia, Oceania and the Americas, as a result of strengthening of the staffing levels within the shared services centres.
As over 60% of the Group’s employees are between 20 and 40 years old, “expert” conferences and mentoring initiatives have been developed to support young talents and foster the transfer of expertise.

 C. Gender equality
With women representing 45% of the Group’s workforce, and 13% of employees in a management position, the CMA CGM Group has committed to fostering gender equality at the workplace for many years. This commitment is demonstrated by a strong recruitment, promotion and training policy as well as the organisation of events such as themed lunches, as a time to share, talk and to inform, collect suggestions from female employees and recommend new actions (Day of the Woman, Pink October, conferences, range of communication campaigns, etc.).
It is also worth noting that pursuant to the Copé-Zimmermann law laying down rules for gender balance in boards of directors (over 40% of female directors), the CMA CGM Board of Directors is comprised of over 45% of female directors.
In 2018, on the United Nations’ International Day of Persons with Disabilities, the CMA CGM Foundation and the Human Resources Department invited employees of the Tower to take part in a round-table discussion about disabilities. This informal event gave employees the opportunity to discuss this issue, share their experiences and report any difficulties. As a further step, the Group Human Resources Department initiated a working group in December 2018 on the consideration of disabilities within the company. The goal is to ultimately increase awareness with regard to diversity as a source of richness, inspiration and creativity for the company.
3. Work organisation A. Quality of life at the workplace
Several steps have been taken to ensure a good work-life balance for employees. For example, a gender equality agreement16 specifies in particular the 100% coverage of paternity leave for shore-based and seagoing personnel, working time arrangements for pregnant women, provision of 12 cribs within a private daycare centre to accommodate 18 children of employees or the payment of an “early childhood allowance” through the works councils, and the establishment of individualised hours for full-time employees (variable time slots) for all onshore institutions in Metropolitan France.
Barring any emergencies, travel must be planned in advance. The seagoing staff also needs fair warning of ship departures so that they can make family arrangements as expressed by the employees. The working conditions are discussed at meetings of the Health and Safety Committees attended by Union and Management Representatives.
Efforts to improve the quality of life at the workplace mainly relate to ensuring better follow-up of employees. For instance, a support process has been introduced to assist employees returning from long-term absences which includes inter alia various meetings organised between the human resources team, the manager and, as applicable, the occupational psychologist.

D. Disability
The CMA CGM Group helps to support people with special needs during their professional career. At the head office in Marseilles, the Occupational Health department is responsible for identifying people with disabilities. Once the Group has been informed, it steps in by offering individual measures to adjust, adapt or transform the work station thereby enabling the relevant employee to retain his or her job. Some of the top initiatives implemented include work station adjustment (foot rests, headsets, ergonomic chairs, specific computer hardware, etc.) and the provision of a designated parking space.
Throughout the year, CMA CGM calls on companies from the sheltered employment sector to provide brochures or office supplies to the head office. Furthermore, in 2017, the Group decided to grant two days of additional leave to employees with a dependent disabled child. As of 31/12/2018, 22 employees have taken advantage of this agreement.

  Launch of a world simplification approach
In late July 2018, the Group launched an approach to simplify procedures with a view to improving its efficiency. This approach is intended for all employees, whether on land or at sea, irrespective of their department or subsidiary. The goal is to identify a problemlatic area which may be simplified or improved within the day-to-day working practices and thereby help to streamline the Group’s organisation.
A specific address has been created to allow employees to share their simplification ideas. This programme has received strongsupportfromemployeessinceits introduction, with over 280 ideas received in just a few months.
We are Shipping
These ideas are studied during a simplification committee meeting, attended by the CEO of the Group and the entire executive team. At the end of the committee meeting, some initiatives are approved to be implemented whereas others which do not require strategic decisions are directly validated by the relevant departments. The Group provides regular updates on the initiatives which have been implemented, and those underway or which have been validated and encourages staff to continue contributing to the simplification approach.
In 2018, 12 women joined this leadership transformation program. Through a whole series of actions and events (group coaching, testimonials of women with an inspiring course, personal branding workshop, training, co-development, personalized HR...), they were able to work on their development plan and create a network in France and internationally with women occupying responsible positions. The program is already starting to produce encouraging results with mobilities and promotions, in France and internationally and a general awareness of the interest for all to develop internally diversity.
48
In 2019, a second group of 14 women will benefit of the same program. The We Are Shipping program will also be deployed in several other countries.
The CMA CGM Group has set up the We Are Shipping program, which aims to support women in their professional development and to promote harmonious internal diversity in management functions.

been provided with various information sharing forums and communication tools to discuss their mobility on a daily basis (dedicated email address, community network, information on the Group’s intranet, etc.).
The company has also signed a partnership
agreement with “La Cité des Entrepreneurs” (an association bringing together the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Euroméditerranée) to take part in, meet, share and keep abreast with new transport alternatives.
The HR team assigned to the Company Mobility Plan will continue to work in 2019 and will rely in particular on the various partnerships established with institutions such as: Métropole, Région Sud (Auditorium, working groups on Mobility, etc.).
Skills-based sponsorship program
In 2018, the CMA CGM Group and the company foundation introduced the Skills sponsorship programme.
This programme is an effort to harness employees’ professional and/or personal skills, to the benefit of a solidarity project. 10 volunteers in Marseilles (under an indefinite-term contract for over 6 months and with the consent of their manager) spent two half-days of their working time in one of the four partner associations of the scheme to help them with specific tasks. This is a genuine commitment by the Group’s employees to their civic responsibility to support associations which help children in difficulty on a daily basis.

Company concierge service
The CMA CGM Group has set up a company concierge service at the Head Office to attend to the well-being of its employees, help them save time and generally make their life easier on a daily basis.
The “Conciergerie by CMA CGM” offers a wide range of services to employees such as:
• Daily services: dry cleaning, ironing, shoe repair shop, sewing workshop, administrative procedures, etc.
• Home service: child minding, homework assistance, house cleaning, DIY projects, gardening, etc.
• Delivery services: medication, flowers, take-away, etc.
• Other services: shirts and ties, coffee capsules, stockings, etc.
Every day, employees can consult with the concierge during the opening hours. They are also able, via a private connection, to contact a 24/7 call centre which allows them to book the services that they require. The services can be paid for online through a secure payment or via an e-wallet.
In 2018, 6,754 employees used the services offered by Conciergerie by CMA CGM, with an average of 550 visits per month.
Partnership with Hôpital Européen
The CMA CGM Group has developed a partnership with Hôpital Européen since 2015. This hospital is located close to the CMA CGM Tower, thereby enabling employees to receive high-quality medical care closeby. They have a dedicated email address to make appointments for consultations and medical exams.
The quality of life at the workplace of seagoing staff
This approach is both proactive and compre- hensive:
• It is proactive as it seeks to improve the Quality of Life at the workplace as a whole and not simply to comply with the legal requirements of preventing Psycho-social Risks;
• It is comprehensive as it acts on the social- organisational levers in connection with the work activity and assists employees with their specific health needs.
The joint Quality of Life at the Workplace group has continued its work. Its role is to analyse the results of the social follow-up and Quality of Life at the Workplace surveys, while issuing recommendations.
Within this context, it carries on the initiatives implemented in previous years: ergonomy of the vessels, Land-Sea relationship, Quality of Life at the Workplace onboard vessels. New actions have been conducted to promote and raise the awareness of the crews to the Quality of Life at the Workplace, good managerial practices, and the prevention of addictions. Furthermore, this year, new measures were introduced, including the simplification of the administrative processes on board, the analysis of accidents with fault tree analyses alongside the persons involved in the accidents.
The CCP group has set up specific training for
the Quality of Life at the Workplace officers
onboard the vessels. This training has been
tailored then transferred to the Maritime 51 Prevention Institute for qualification purposes
and extended to all shipping companies.
The Quality of Life at the Workplace officers onboard the vessels will be provided with awareness raising tools to conduct their prevention actions. The CCP group will act as a “back-up” support for these individuals.
A partnership with ESP Consulting, an expert sports and performance centre has been implemented, in order to optimise the health and physical performance of seagoing personnel and reduce accident rate. ESP Consulting set up a pilot group onboard a vessel for three months to carry out its tasks, be identified by staff at sea and gather from the seagoing personnel the options for future improvement. The result obtained revealed an improvement of 40% of the physical condition for all the assessed criteria.
Another area for improvement for seagoing personnel is the food onboard vessels. A test phase was conducted with direct supply of the vessels without using the services of a shipchandler. The outcome was a positive one both in terms of the quality of the food and the pricing. This experiment will be gradually extended to the other vessels.
 Mobility Plan
 In May 2018, a specific mobility team was put together in Marseilles primarily to improve day-to-day mobility and simplify the use of public transportation.
Following a survey of employees, several avenues have been explored and practical solutions have been proposed. These include:
• the “C-Park” in-house application: this application was developed by the CMA
CGM digital teams as a means of optimising the unused parking spaces at the CMA CGM Tower (leaves, absences, business trips, etc.). Following a trial period in the Summer of 2018, the application was officially launched in November 2018. This solution serves to reallocate an average of 80 parking spaces per day, to employees who are in need of a parking space; up to 150 spaces may be distributed per day during holiday periods.
• A dedicated car sharing platform: “Klaxit”. The employees who are interested in the solution and offering their services sign up
and input their journey into the application. The first 20,000 kilometers are offered by CMA CGM to employees. This solution was introduced in 2018 and enabled 82% of the registered employees to receive car sharing offers.
Furthermore, during the Mobility week, various communication initiatives were organised to pass on the solutions proposed and to promote the day-to-day mobility of employees (open house days, information sessions, poster campaign in the elevators, creation of a community group, article in the company’s internal newsletter, etc.).
In addition, employees in Marseilles have

B. Psycho-social risk prevention
The Group’s policy on psycho-social risks is covered by an agreement signed on 20 May 2010 (agreement on preventing psycho-social risks among CMA CGM UES employees). The document provides milestones for a preventive programme to measure, analyse and monitor psycho-social risks. The recommended actions include:
• Preventing risks of workplace or sexual harrassment and instituting a reporting procedure;
• Organising training courses for managers in psycho-social risk prevention.
Since the agreement was signed, a psychological support unit has been set up. The unit is available by telephone or online 24/7 and is a completely confidential space for employees to talk to someone of their choice. In addition to preventing psycho-social risks, it embodies the Group’s sustained promise to improve life in the workplace for its employees. Several long-term projects have been launched at both the individual and collective levels. The
52 priority areas to work on are work environment, social climate and employee guidance.
As part of the 2018 action plan, the Group commissioned an external training organisation to continue providing training to managers regarding good managerial practices.
An action plan on the Quality of Life at the Workplace has also been introduced and is structured around optimising working processes and procedures and specific workshops dedicated to good practices for reducing psycho-social risks.
The plan will be continued in 2019 with the occupational psychologist via the provision of training to managers regarding Quality of Life at the Workplace: Identification of risk factors, support to employees experiencing difficulties, emotional and relational intelligence.
In connection with an individual approach, a review will also be conducted on 4 areas relating to employee wellbeing: emotional balance (dedicated conferences and workshops), improvement of organic nutritional intake at the company restaurant (dedicated dietician), physical activity (improvement of the facilities offered at the fitness centre), and sleep.
C. Work organisation
Work schedules are routinely organised in line with the prevailing local legislation. Working time arrangements have been instituted in some areas to enhance the work- home life balance and best meet the needs of customers.
Since 2007, the CMA CGM France UES (economic and social unit) for shore-based staff in France has an Agreement on Scheduling and Reducing Working Time. In addition to the legally mandated 35 hours of effective working time, it ensures flexibility for employees who are paid a flat rate. On a general basis for any organisation, managers must ensure workloads are properly divided and optimum organisation for their teams.
In 2016, a system was put in place to track, count and check employee attendance on the Marseilles site (Attendance Check Agreement). The working time remains unchanged, however it may vary by relatively 3 hours per week, provided that the average time per month is observed. The arrival and departure time ranges of the employees have been extended for greater flexibility in the management of their schedules.
In 2018, the pilot programme for telecommuting in the company was introduced.
Telecommuting is an innovative form of working organisation which enables inter alia a better home-life balance, improved working conditions for employees and greater independence in the accomplishment of their tasks.
To this end, a pilot programme for telecommuting was experimented for four months for a limited number of services and employees at the Marseilles and Le Havre sites.
77 volunteers who met the eligibility criteria telecommuted for one day per week as mutually agreed between the employee and his or her manager. To support them in this process, a guideline has been compiled to answer all their questions.
As the deadline date for the end of the experiment approached, it was found that the initial period of 4 months was insufficient to make an accurate and definitive assessment. Therefore, in October 2018, the trial period was extended by 4 months as officialised by the signature of an amendment to the agreement covering the telecommuting scheme within the Marseilles and Le Havre facilities.
53
The work organisation for seagoing staff complies with the international standards set by the Maritime Labour Convention 2006 which entered into force on 28 February 2013.
Consequently, on the vessels:
• The number of working hours cannot exceed 14 hours per period of 24 hours and 72 hours per period of 7 days;
• The minimum rest time cannot be less than 10 hours per period of 24 hours and 77 hours per period of 7 days;
The fleet management department adopted the rest time system, and the monthly working hours are monitored on board and on land to ensure our compliance.
In order to see to it that seagoing staff get enough rest and avoid fatigue, the Group initially set a monitoring threshold of 120 hours for ratings and 150 hours for the hospitality department.
In general, the Captain and the Chief Mechanic on board oversee that the standards established in the convention are followed.
Maritime Labour Convention
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) met in 2006 to create a unique document aggregating all the obligations concerning the working conditions and life onboard vessels. The Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) was created, adopted and published, and this convention became mandatory as of 2013.
International maritime law now has 4 pillars:
• SOLAS: Safety - Convention for the safety of life at sea;
• MARPOL: Environment - Convention for the prevention of maritime pollution;
• STCW: Training and certificate - International convention on standards of training, certification and watch-keeping for seafarers;
• MLC: Social protection and working conditions – Maritime Labour Convention, i.e. the minimum living and working conditions for all seafarers In August 2017, 84 members of the ILO ratified this convention, representing 89% of global shipping.
MLC is organised into 5 parts:
• Minimum requirements for seafarers to work on a ship;
• Employment conditions;
• Accommodation, recreational facilities, food and catering;
• Health protection, medical care, welfare and social security protection; • Compliance and enforcement.
Due to the high quality of its vessels, CMA CGM was able to implement the MLC well before the deadline date of 2013.
During the certification phase, no major shortcoming was found and whenever the vessels are inspected, the Group demonstrates excellent working and living conditions onboard its ships.

 D. Social dialogue
Social dialogue is a vital part of company life. It mainly occurs by providing employees with information. Strategy, economic, finance, social and organisational questions are addressed in a range of meetings attended by staff and management representatives. In addition to the staff representatives appointed at each entity17 , these include the Group Committee, Central Works Council in France, Entity Commitees, the CHSCT (Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee) and a variety of specialised joint commissions.
Pursuant to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and by virtue of the principles instituted in its Code of Ethics, the Group undertakes to respect the freedom of labour unions and the rules of association in the countries where it operates.
In France, several agreements18 were signed in 2018:
• 2018-2020 profit sharing agreement; 54 • 2018 NAO agreement;
• Agreement on the telecommuting expe- riment within the Marseilles and Le Havre facilities;
• Amendment No. 1 to the telecommuting experiment within the Marseilles and Le Havre facilities
• Modification of the binding corporate rules of the Marseilles and Le Havre entities and other sites in France to comply with the Group’s Code of Ethics, the Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct and the whistleblowing policy.
4. An attractive employer A. Career management
In 2017, the Group continued the development of career management, inter alia by transforming its HR tools. A new talent management approach was proposed for better support through the roll-out of the C&Me “Talent Management” module as an employer, in more than 40 countries for over 15,000 employees. It involves succession plans, identification of talents, assessments, optimisation and forecasting
of organisations depending on activities. Within this context, the Group has implemented a “High Potential” identification process. This international review of “High Potential” is used to determine the key positions and anticipate succession plans.
Furthermore, the Group encourages the initiatives of all employees seeking to embark upon new challenges. To this end, the Performance Interview, which has been officialised since 2015 in the new human resources management tool C&Me, allows shore-based employees and their line managers to take stock of their goals, measure their performance, formulate new career development wishes and express their training needs.
Mobility makes it possible to put skills where they are needed within the Group. The Group’s mobility policy offers a variety of innovative career paths in addition to regular types of mobility (expatriation, local contracts, secondment). As a result, employees are better able to expand their range of skills, hone their expertise or rise up through the ranks in managerial positions.
JUMP (Junior Upwards Mobility Program), as an innovative scheme, gives our young talents a chance to work abroad for 6 months to discover new jobs and a different working environment. Every year, some twenty employees take part in this international mobility programme.
“SWAP” is another option whereby two employees from different entities trade jobs.
The VIE programme (Volontariat International en Entreprise – French intern- ship programme) sends young graduates abroad to our local organisations to expand their knowledge, acquire new interpersonal skills and help standardise practices and procedures within the Group. At the end of their contracts, we offer them career opportunities and a chance to take on new challenges to help the Group grow. In 2018, 30 VIE participants were stationed primarily in Africa, Asia, North and South America.
Finally, every year, the Group offers employees expatriation contracts in a number of different countries. In addition to sharing best practices and standardising working methods, international mobility gives employees exposure to more responsibility and the chance to widen their range of skills.
The programme involves discussions, conferences and targeted communications throughout the year, whereby employees learn about the interests of international mobility.
In 2017, new programmes were introduced to attract, retain and develop the talents within the Group.
The Sponsorship programme is aimed at accelerating and easing the integration of Executives.
Mentoring is also available to support our talents in taking their job positions.
These two programmes are based on establishing a special relationship, confidence and mutual respect, and allow experienced employees to share their knowledge of the Group, their network and their experience.
In 2019, focus will be placed on developing Mentoring within the company.
A panel of managers will be invited to take part in an information session on Mentoring that will be coordinated by the Group Human Resources Department. At the end of this session, some of the managers, who have volunteered to take part in the programme, will receive a half-day of training on the
role and responsibilities of the Mentor. As support, a group for discussion and sharing between mentors will be formed.
The Lead Program was continued in 2018, with:
• The launch of the 3rd promotion deficated to the Americas (ended in late 2018);
• The start of the 4th promotion (24 participants for the Europe Middle East Africa region). This CMA CGM Corporate leadership training programme that was established as a partnership with Sciences Po Paris & Financial Times |E Business School CLA, is designed to prepare young Talents in managerial positions to cope with the future challenges of our industry and take up positions of responsibility.
Since its launch in 2017, 91 Group employees have taken part in this leadership programme, including 68 in 2018.
17 UES Maritime entities not including French seagoing personnel.
18 Agreements relating to the CMA CGM UES scope: CMA CGM SA, CMA CGM Antilles Guyane, CMA CGM Agences France, CMA Ships, Traveller’s Club, CMA CGM Réunion, CMA CGM Logistics, CMA CGM LOG France.

Projet Feedback 360°
In 2018, the Group decided to embark upon the development of an overall feedback culture in the company.
Feedback 360° is an individual development tool:
• Comparing self-perception (self-assess- ment) and colleagues’ perception serves to identify the strengths and areas for improvement of a participant whether he or she knows them;
“Thomas International”
• The procedure is continued by an indiv- idual development plan around concrete actions.
In France, CMA CCGM has been using the “Thomas International” questionnaire for the past several years as a tool for making good recruiting decisions. This assessment tool specifically describes the behavioural module of an individual in a work situation. The result gives rise to a constructive discussion with the candidate which confirms or disproves the analysis of his or her professional profile. The “Thomas APP” provides additional information which supplements the assessment made by the recruiter.
The pilot project was launched with a portion of the Corporate Officers in Marseilles so that, in turn, they can become actors of the feedback culture within their organisation.
In implementing Feedback 360°, the company would like to institute a long- term process with the teams and enable individual and collective development.
All of the HR teams abroad have been trained in using the tool and propose it to all their candidates.
In 2019, the “Team” version of the questionnaire will be tested in Marseilles. The “APP Team” questionnaire will serve to pool all the profiles of a team, create a profile therefrom and highlight the key points thereof (support points, comple- mentarity of the profiles, areas to be developed, etc.). Therefore, the tool and its analysis enable a better understanding of the various interactions of the team for better cooperation and to determine the avenues for making full use of its development potential.
questionnaire
The operational HR teams in Marseilles will be trained in using the tool and will subsequently coordinate workshops with the various teams.
 Onboarding process
Integration is an essential issue which has emerged as a driving force behind the retention and development of our new talents. It is a decisive period of the employee’s career which must be given our entire attention and requires the involvement of all stakeholders in the company.
In 2017, the implementation of the “Onboarding” process in the USA, and then in France, allowed the CMA CGM Group to professionalise the new employee orientation process. At present, even before arriving in the company, new employees receive special guidance for the accomplishment of administrative formalities and key information (via a digital portal) in order to foster adherence to the company’s culture and values.
In 2019, the “Onboarding” process will be introduced in Singapore and the employees will have access to a new information portal which can now be consulted from C&Me. This new version of the digital portal will also be implemented in the US and in France in 2019.
Espace MAPP
CMA CGM is also a member of the Espace MAPP Association in the PACA region (Mobility and Career Guidance). Espace MAPP supports the inter-company mobility of employees from several locally influential companies through shared experiences or feedback enhanced by training sessions also conducted by the association, thereby offering a diverse range of career paths.
In 2018, a new concept “Talents & Territoires” was introduced in connection with Espace Mapp.
“Talents & Territoires” is aimed at establishing contact between employees of major corporations with local SMEs/ start-up so that these companies can take advantage of the specific skills offered by the employees. In summary, the project is akin to a skills sponsorship programme by local corporations for the local economic environment.
57
  Managing the careers of
seagoing personnel:
The fleet management department regularly monitors the careers of seagoing personnel. A briefing is held at each embarkation during which the validity of certificates is verified and a check is conducted to determine whether seafarers attended the mandatory training sessions. The Group is working to set up a “land-sea-land” career management system for officers of its owned fleet. They are given assignments at the head office to facilitate discussions between the various sectors and provide them with future career opportunities on shore.

B. A competitive wage policy
In order to attract, retain and motivate talents, CMA CGM relies on a wage policy that has 3 priorities:
• Equality within the company • External competitiveness
• Performance-based
Since July 2016, as part of the integration of the APL teams, the CMA CGM Group has undertaken an overall approach to harmonise salaries and health insurance, welfare and pension schemes, in approximately 40 countries. This process was conducted via comparative studies regarding the levels (salary, social benefits) and the structures for the relevant countries. As a follow-up, an audit was initiated in late 2017 for all the Group companies. In 2018, the audit report provided an exhaustive assessment of the Group’s supplementary health care, welfare and pension schemes.
The approach to harmonise the health insurance and welfare schemes continued in 2018 and gave rise to the signature of an umbrella policy with an international broker on 1 December 2018.
The broker’s scope will initially extend to 55 countries for which it will negotiate the policies or policy renewals for the Group (life insurance / disability and health care).
The CMA CGM Group is thereby demonstrating its desire to align the level of health and welfare coverage for the Group’s employees to market practices (similar industry), while taking into account unique local and regional characteristics.
For information, on 31/12/2018, the payroll amounted to: USD 1,886 M.

In 2018, the Group Human Resources Department wanted to assist all employees of the France scope in the transition process to the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system as of January 1, 2019
Therefore, in addition to the official campaign led by the Tax Authorities, at all the sites, the employees were invited to information sessions coordinated by Ernst & Young.
The aim was to help them understand and anticipate the change, outline all the impacts of the reform and give them the opportunity to ask questions to a tax lawyer.

• In 2018, CMA CGM Academy organised training on the IFRS 16 standard. This is a new international accounting standard for the finance teams (classroom and e-learning sessions), which must be applied as of 1 January 2019.
• All the Group’s operations worldwide are subject to rules on competition law. To deepen employees’ insight into these rules, CMA CGM Academy offers e-learning courses related to Competition Compliance.
• CMA CGM Academy offered employees an overview of the general anti-corruption laws and principles and, more generally, the laws and principles applicable in the shipping sector.
• The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) lays down strict rules for the handling, storage and processing of data. These rules apply to all CMA CGM companies worldwide which process the data of citizens and residents of the European Union. The Group Legal
Department and CMA CGM Academy introduced a new compulsory training module for the entire staff on the basic data protection rules.
•The CMA CGM Group is currently deploying Office 365 suite to all employees. In addition to the Microsoft office automation tools (Word, Excel, etc.), Office 365 also offers new online collaborative services such as Teams and Yammer. To guide employees in their familiarisation with these tools, a set of video tutorials (from beginner to expert level) is available on the Academy portal. This is intended to help them broaden their knowledge of the new version of the office automation tools as well as to learn about the new tools which are fundamental to collaborative working.
• In order to ensure optimum implementation of the various LISA training modules (SAP), CMA CGM Academy has put together, trained and guided a network of “Super Key Users” and “Key Users”.

C. A strategic training policy
The Group’s training policy is part of a comprehensive strategy on career management and skills development.
The CMA CGM Group is committed to maintaining and strengthening the skills of its workforce. In 2018, the Group administered 212,342 hours of training to all its employees. The difference in the number of hours of training in 2017 and 2018 is due to a change in the method of calculating the training hours.
CMA CGM Academy helps all employees on a daily basis in all their job-related activities and offers a wide range of e-learning or classroom-based courses with an instructor to fulfil everyone’s needs. Its purpose is to guide the Group’s strategy particularly via strategic actions such as the strengthening of human expertise combined with an agile organisation. This is obtained through the administering of agile training courses to support the projects (raising awareness to the agile method, Lean Six Sigma, etc.).

19 Financial consolidation scope.
20 The scope of the classroom training data corresponds to France shore-based and seagoing employees, i.e. 23.6% of the 2018 Group consolidated workforce // The scope of the distance training data corresponds to shore-based and World Crewing employees in C&Me, i.e. 94% of the 2018 Group consolidated workforce. It should be noted that the “training” data reporting process is being rendered more reliable with the ultimate goal of achieving a scope of 100% of the Group’s consolidated workforce. It is also worth noting that all the data related to the training of employees from all Group entities is ultimately intended to be collected by the C&Me tool. Finally, as the reporting methodology has changed for the calculation of distance training hours, the 2017 data was not reused as it could not be compared with the 2018 values.
 The commitment of our employees 2018 Corporate Social ResponsIbility Report

  Certificate
Launch of blended
training programmes
training courses
In 2018, the Academy also developed certificate training programmes for France. The development of this type of programme requires a sizable investment from the company as well as the training organisations to comply with a stringent regulatory context. These comprehensive and professional development programmes are an asset for employees’ employability as their skills are valued and recognised by the certification. For example, the language certificate training courses are validated by TOIEC (Test of English for International Communication), the office automation training courses by TOSA (Test On Software Applications) and the managerial training courses by Titles such as Head of business administration and management issued by Kedge Business School.
In 2018, the Academy also focused on the development of innovative blended training courses at the head office and in the agencies. The blended courses combine various types of learning activities (e-learning, classroom- based, various resources).
For example, the INSIGHT programme uses this type of training as it offers a course that is comprised of inspiring videos, e-learning modules prior to sessions and inter-sessions, as well as regular and fruitful interactions with the instructor and leader, via exercises to be handed in and co-development workshops.
The same formula has been used for targeted training courses: sales representatives, maritime operational staff, line management controllers. 60
The CMA CGM Group proactively pursues dialogue between higher education and business, so it forms close working relationships with universities and colleges.
In France, the CMA CGM Group formed active partnerships with Sciences Po Paris, HEC Paris, Kedge BS, Aix Marseilles Université, IAE Aix-en-Provence and IEP Aix-en-Provence. These agreements created official links between CMA CGM and these institutions, and provide a framework for the mutual commitments that they have made. The joint initiatives take the form of conferences, round-table discussions, CMA CGM industry experts speaking in university courses, and business projects, the Group’s participation in the examination committees or its taking part in opening ceremonies and gala evenings.
Outside of the agreement, the Group also conducts occasional partnership actions by attending conferences, round-table discussions and job fairs organised by top French universities (Grandes Ecoles) such as forums at ESCP, Polytechnique or EM Lyon. These events give the Group the opportunity to expose students to the business and the wide variety of jobs in the industry.
21 Design Thinking is an innovation and management approach that is considered as a synthesis between analytic thinking and intuitive thinking. It relies heavily on a co-creativity process involving feedback from the end user.
Creation of the LAB
The Lab by CMA CGM was also created in 2017. It is an area dedicated to innovation and transformation.
This disruptive working space is based on 4 pillars:
> Imagine
> Experiment
> Create
> Work together
The Lab offers a modular working area as well as digital equipment providing access to exclusive resources such as the work headed by the Academy’s teams in “Design Thinking”21 mode. In 2018, the occupancy rate of the Lab was 72%.
D. Key partnerships
Training
for seagoing staff:
The Training for seagoing staff is based on STCW 2010 training courses (international convention that determines the required professional certificates for each onboard function), some of the certificates are renewed every 5 years after refresher training, and after some training courses needed for CMA CGM tools as requested by CMA Ships (internal software, techniques, safety, simulators, etc.).

Over the years, CMA CGM and Kedge Bu- siness School have developed a close partnership specifically due to this master’s course which is designed to develop the skills of future managers / leaders in the international trade and logistics sector. This is a key ele- ment for the company which is always on the lookout for new talents.
Throughout the year, the CMA CGM Group hosts young high school students in Marseilles as part of their 10th grade internship entitled “Discovery of the world of work”. Exclusively reserved for the children of employees, this initiative is highly popular with the employees of the head office. It is a means for them to introduce their children to their working environment and for the children to find out what their parents’ jobs entail. It is also a way for the company to provide insight into its operations and increase its local presence.
Fostering
creative cooperation with Thecamp
Thecamp, located close to Aix-en- Provence, is a campus for innovation and interaction dedicated to the city of tomorrow and digital transformation. It is a unique and extraordinary place where students at the end of their studies and professionals go to receive training and information (training courses, conferences, meet-ups, hackathons, events, collaborative projects, etc.).
As a private partner and founder of Thecamp, CMA CGM takes its employees there throughout the year, to get inspiration and to imagine, anticipate and build a desirable future that is being made possible by new technologies.

In 2018, the company also welcomed pupils from the priority education area (ZEP – Zone d’Éducation Prioritaire) to do their 10th grade internship at the facility in Marseilles. Accordingly, several periods were identified during the year to guarantee optimum organisation and make them feel especially welcome in the company.
As of 31/12/2018, over sixty 10th grade interns have been hosted at the head office.
Furthermore, in 2018, the CMA CGM Group and the local Education Authority signed an innovative partnership introducing teaching of maritime transport in secondary schools. The CMA CGM Group is delighted to have the opportunity to share its shipping experience and expertise with the teaching staff and students.
Therefore, 2018 saw visits from groups of students and their teachers to the site in order to learn about the Group, its business operations and its wide variety of jobs in an international context.
E. An efficient information system
Since 2014, the Human Resources information system, C&Me, has been helping standardise HR processes around the world. This tool offers greater visibility of all HR programmes (mobility, development, training courses) and fosters better performing and more detailed management of human resources through elements such as objectives and skills management. Lastly, it encourages employees to be more proactive and effective in their careers.
Subsequent to the roll-out of “Talent Performance” in 2015, two other modules were added to the C&Me HR series in 2016, providing HR teams and managers with the necessary leeway to steer the teams and manage resources:
• “Talent Acquisition”, dedicated to recruiting and internal mobility;
• “Talent Management”, career management tool.
The entire recruiting process is now paperless, from the recruitment request to the selected candidate’s joining the company. C&Me allows managers to monitor the progress of their requests as well as their recruitments. They are able to review the application and assess them online. It is also a new talent management initiative which is being offered to provide better support to HR and managers in their day-to-day activities: talent acquisition, training, performance, development and mobility.
All the HR processes have been reviewed through C&Me, making them simpler, more standardised and leaner and thereby more in line with the key issues at stake for the Group.
In 2017, two new modules were deployed:
• “On Boarding”, dedicated to the integration of new employees. With the roll-out of this new module in the USA and in France, the entire integration process is now paperless, from the performance of administrative formalities to the provision of practical information provided to employees even before their first day at the company;
• “Work Force Analytics” is a reporting tool that offers each HR BP synthetic information and key indicators depending on his or her scope.
This tool also offers a new approach for
the extraction of C&Me data with reliable
indicators shared by all the countries where
it has been introduced. 63
The roll-out of C&Me continued in 2018 to reach over 30,000 employees managed in the tool across more than 80 countries. The roll-out mainly related to the Africa region and some subsidiaries recently integrated within the Group.
2018 ended with the implementation of the new C&Me interface ensuring a better user experience for the Group employees (simplified design, more intuitive interface, compatibility with mobile terminals, etc.).
In 2019, the “Onboarding” module will be introduced in Singapore and the new digital portal will be migrated to the US and in France. The Group recruiting portal will also be entirely redesigned and will receive a new ergonomy to guarantee enhanced user experience (clearer view of openings at the Group, compatibility with mobile telephones, etc.).

1. Maritime safety
Maritime safety is governed by stringent local and international laws and regulations that are usually determined at the international level through the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) as well as at the regional and local levels.
These laws and regulations are complex and change often. The Group’s compliance is routinely evaluated through a series of external audits by the authorities, the port of call country, classification societies, as well as through internal inspections and audits. Accordingly, each vessel is subject to three- fold regulations each with their own specific inspections:
Indicators
Average number of deficiencies per inspection
Number of detentions

   66
Employee health and safety is a major priority for the Group. Some operations and jobs represent significant risks, particularly onboard vessels, as well as in the terminal and warehouse operations.
The CMA CGM Group’s safety policy is designed to avoid any accident which may result in injuries or the loss of human life, whether to employees at sea or on land, or major damage to the vessels, goods or the environment. This is achieved by establishing a set of procedures in an Integrated Management System (IMS) which are periodically assessed and revised. These procedures are common to all vessels managed by CMA Ships, regardless of the flag.
A dedicated organisation, the SSE (Security, Safety, Environment) department, analyses and prevents risks inspects and implements technical and organisational procedures in accordance with the regulations in force. Every year, the department conducts audits onboard the vessels and on land, to verify that the CMA CGM safety policy is properly applied. It is also in charge of operational coordination in the event of a major crisis.
Certifications
CMA Ships has undertaken an additional process of triple certification for its entire scope22:
• ISO 9001 Quality and Customer Satisfaction; • OHSAS 18001, Occupational Health
and Safety;
• ISO 14001, Environmental Protection.
As part of the efforts to continuously improve the QHSSE performance of the terminals23, 2018 ended with 18 OHSAS 18001, ISO 14001 and ISO 9011 certifications obtained for all of the 23 covered terminals, i.e. approximately 39% of the Terminals subject to the CMA CGM QHSSE policy which has established a voluntary certification process. The goal for 2019 is to maintain this level of certification.

Merchandises
• The regulations of its flag. The CMA CGM owned fleet is distributed under 14 different flags: primarily European and Singapore flags;
• Local or regional regulations.
As a means of checking the seaworthiness of the vessels, the port of call countries carry out regular inspections onboard the ships: Port State Control – PSC. If problems are detected, deficiencies are recorded and may result in the detention of the ship.
During 2018, the owned fleet obtained a deficiency rate per PSC (Port State Control) of 1.08, this same rate was 0.71 deficiencies per PSC in 2017. This increase stemmed from 2 factors:
• A problem with a PSC officer in Nakhodka (Russia). This PSC officer records deficiencies which are not based on regulations, and detains vessels based only on their flag States. If the United Kingdom detains a Russian vessel, he will detain a British vessel in a spirit of reciprocity. Complaints have been filed to invalidate the deficiencies and detentions via the relevant flag States of the vessels (France, UK, Cyprus). These complaints have been sent to the Russian authorities as well as the Tokyo MOU secretariat.
• The rise in the number of PSCs in 2018 increased the risk of deficiency.

In 2018, 11 ships were detained. Of these 11 ships, complaints have been filed for 6 to have the ships released (including 4 ships detained in Nakhodka). The 5 other detentions are as follows:
•CMA CGM FORT SAINT PIERRE was detained under the PARIS MOU due to poor deck condition. The ship was released further to performance of the repair work.
• CMA CGM TANGER was detained
under the VINA DEL MAR MOU
due to poor training of the team in
emergency procedures. At the time
the ship was detained, it was not
managed by CMA Ships but by a third-
party Shipmanager. Therefore, it was not
a CMA Ships crew that was manning the
ship. Since then, ship management has
been recovered directly by CMA Ships. 67 The ship was released after training of
the crew.
• APL SAVANNAH was detained under the
PARIS MOU due to a crack in the body of the oily water separator. The ship was released after this crack was repaired.
• APL HOLLAND was detained by USCG due to failure to comply with security procedures for the screening of people at the gangway. The ship was released after the crew received training and an additional audit by the classification society.
• CMA CGM AMBER was detained under the TOKYO MOU due to safety exercises (fire, confined space) which were not done or which were poorly done. The ship was released further to crew training and satisfactory performance of the exercises.

The severity of the maritime events is classified based on a matrix rated from A to D, with D being a serious event. This matrix takes into account 4 major categories of impacts:
• Impacts on the health and safety of the vessel and the crew;
• Environmental impact;
• Impact on the public;
• Financial impact.
Between 2017 and 2018, the major maritime events, rated D, slightly increased from 5 to 8.
• On CMA CGM VOLGA, the ship’s cook was found dead in his cabin due to a heart attack.
Fleet Navigation Center: state-of-the-art technological resources
Modern technological resources such as those related to the weather are developed in-house by the expert captains of the Fleet Centers in order to mitigate navigation- related risks. These resources are then provided to the captains and officers onboard the Group’s Vessels and include navigation aid systems or decision-making systems for navigation during bad weather. At the centres located in Marseilles, Singapore and Miami, experienced ship captains constantly track the routes, analyse risks and advise and support the fleet vessels as well as the Group’s operational staff.
The navigation centres are also tasked with ensuring optimum piloting practices in terms of Fuel consumption, compliance with ship speeds in whale reproduction areas, compliance with the regulated navigation areas. To this end, the experts at the centres have developed innovative piloting methods, as well as methods for the kinematic monitoring of the vessels associated with powerful analysis tools
vessels, to study navigation-related risks and to proactively set the rules of access to the ports. Indeed, this involves adjusting the cargo capacity in order to guarantee economic profitability while constantly preserving the vessels, crews and the port environment. Therefore, the rules of access concern the sizes of the ships (length, width and draught), the necessary support equipment (such as tugboats) as well as the acceptable hydrometeorological conditions (tides, currents, wind). In similar fashion, feedback is collected so as to provide the successive ship’s captains with the most up- to-date and relevant information possible.
Search and rescue
Because of the vastness of the oceans, the various players in the shipping industry have to work together to rescue people in danger. At whatever time, the vessels may have to be diverted to lend assistance to another ship in distress. These operations are Search & Rescue (SAR) operations. In 2018, 13 operations were carried out by vessels in the owned fleet.

• On CMA CGM G. WASHINGTON, 138 containers were lost at sea in the Pacific due to bad weather.
• On CMA CGM OHIO, the ship’s captain was found dead in his cabin due to a heart attack.
• On APL SCOTLAND, a mechanic was found dead in his cabin due to a heart attack.
• On APL SOUTHAMPTON collided with a fishing boat of the coast of China. The fishing boat sank, resulting in the death of 2 seafarers.
• On APL SOUTHAMPTON, a lieutenant was found dead. This death was due to suicide.
  In 2018, 8 major maritime events (D) were recorded:
• On CMA CGM TIGRIS, a kilogram of cocaine was discovered on the deck by the dockers. The vessel was detained for 1 week by the Chinese authorities to conduct an investigation. The investigation proved that the crew was not involved. This event was rated D due to the financial impacts of the delay in vessel departure.
• CMA CGM NORMA collided with a ship in China. The other ship sank without causing any injuries.
The SSE department carried out investigations subsequent to each of these events to determine the causes and recommend corrective actions to avoid their re-occurrence.

A proven crisis management plan
Although the CMA CGM safety management procedures are mainly preventive, the Group also has a comprehensive plan for managing crisis situations. This plan contains responses to emergency situations onboard ships as well as at the branches and terminals. The plan is tested at least once per year and routine training sessions are conducted to improve the response capabilities of the crisis management teams. In addition, the Group carries out regular drills in conjunction with the authorities to prepare for potentially dangerous events. These include pirate attack simulations, emergency towing, fire and pollution.
which take into account the geography, meteorological elements and marine currents in real time, as well as the risks related to piracy. This year, a new tool was developed to anticipate Deadlines and congestions in order to reduce as early as possible the speed and waiting time before the ports and thereby lessen the Carbon footprint via innovative actions.
In partnership with the Reefer Department, the fleet centers have become GDP- compliant (good distribution practices of pharmaceutical products) and now monitor in real time very sensitive Reefers such as Aquaviva, Pharmaceuticals & Superfreezer.
A team of ship’s captains with expertise in Vessel operation study and set the rules for nautical access to all the ports at which the Group calls. Given the introduction of new ships into the fleet, as well as the constant changes being made to ports and terminals, a group of experts is needed with strong experience in the operation of large
Stowaways
Measures have been put in place onboard ships in order to prevent the boarding of stowaways, make regular searches to detect their potential presence and, as applicable, to manage the stowaways found on board. These procedures have been included in the Ship Security Plan (SSP), which is set by the International Ship and Port facility Security (ISPS) code.
The ship’s SSP is a confidential document. In 2018, 9 stowaways were found onboard vessels of the owned fleet.
 > • Executive Management
• Communication Department
In the event of a crisis, the affected entity will firstly call the 24/7 emergency hotline where it will be put in touch with the person on call. This person will inform the various departments of the situation, and based on the severity of the event, will decide to start a crisis unit bringing together all the relevant parties. There is a dedicated room for this purpose in Marseilles and Singapore with all the necessary means of communication. The crisis will therefore be managed from this room. Once the crisis has been resolved, an investigation will be carried out to determine the causes of the problem and to draw lessons therefrom in order to avoid recurrence of the same event.

2. Occupational health and safety
The Group’s prevention policy revolves around risks analyses of safety and working conditions. This is a process of continuous improvement whereby all players, from Top Management to seagoing staff and operational staff, are involved on a day-to- day basis.
The vessels of the owned fleet sail under different state flags, in international waters with seafarers from different cultures and nationalities. As a result, the standardisation of the procedures and practices within our fleet has become a major issue. With this in mind, the Accident Prevention Committee (APC) was created. This committee meets regularly and reviews results concerning health and safety, regulatory changes, feedback from the vessels and innovations which may improve safety onboard the vessels.
At the various maritime, inland or shore- based entities and in accordance with applicable regulations, all risks are identified, assessed and covered annual prevention plans.
These prevention plans address various themes such as personal protection equipment, chemical risks, psychosocial risks, addictions and noise exposure.
The main health and safety risks to the employees differ based on the business activities:
Shipping26
Frequency
rate of work accidents - with sick leave
127 028 For the maritime scope, the frequency rate
of accidents increased in 2018 compared with 2017, with a rate of 1.25 in 2018 against 0.9 in 2017, with a constantly growing number of vessels each year. There were more accidents in 2018, however they were less severe and involved shorter absences.
In 2018, the Severity Rate was integrated as a performance indicator for vessels. This rate measures the number of days sick leave further to a work accident per thousand of hours worked. For 2018, the score was 0.2.
Shipping activities
• Fire / explosion
• Falls from height or tripping and falling
• Risks associated with manual handling operations
• Psychosocial risks
• Movement and posture
• Noise / Vibration
Terminal activities
• Collisions between machinery and pedestrians
• Falls from height • Manual handling
• Tripping and falling
• Falling objects (mainly lashing bars)
• Vibrations • Electricity
Every quarter, feedback on the events which occurred on board (accidents, near misses and inspections) is compiled and discussed among the owned fleets. This gives seafarers the opportunity to draw from each other’s experiences and put them in a better position to anticipate risks.
Training and awareness campaigns are crucial components of prevention. They revolve around compulsory job-related training courses, knowledge-building sessions on land, on board, at the work station, remote training tool and catalogue for seagoing staff, special training courses for all second officers as well as a programme of regular drills and navigation simulators. Seminars are held at the head office and attended by officers from all the Group’s fleets. Attendees discuss a range of operational and onboard safety-related topics (analysis of reported events, safety management, etc.).
Furthermore, the Group is an active member of the CSSF – Container Ship Safety Forum. This non-governmental organisation which was started in 2014 brings together major shipping players with the aim of improving safety performance and container shipping management practices.

The frequency rate of work accidents with sick leave at the terminals managed by the Group decreased in one year due to an efficient prevention policy for the entire scope. 2018 saw an increase in the volumes and operations of the terminals. However, the risk assessment approach implemented at the terminals serves to decrease the work accidents with sick leave. In 2018, a fatal accident occurred at one of our terminals. It was a collision between a pedestrian, employed at the terminal, and a handling vehicle that was reversing at the time. The victim died further to the injuries sustained.

The accidents onboard vessels involving seagoing staff are not the only ones counted by the Company. The accidents affecting shore-based staff working on board are also monitored and are reported and analysed.
Work accidents with leave of more than 24 hours and/or near misses considered very serious are routinely investigated to analyse the causes and to introduce the appropriate corrective and preventive actions.

Excellence in safety and security 2018 Corporate Social ResponsIbility Report

   72
Near misses
A near miss is an involuntary incident which could have caused damage, injuries or death, but which was narrowly avoided. These near misses must be studied, recorded and the experiences shared to reduce the probabilities of similar incidents occurring. Most work accidents are preceded by near misses which should have served as a warning. In 2018, CMA Ships recorded 1,950 near misses, an increase of approximately 2% compared with 2017.
Asbestos risk
CMA Ships took the initiative of updating the Inventory of Hazardous Material (IHM) on the managed vessels of its owned fleet. This update is recommended by the 2009 Hong Kong Convention and by the European Regulation on ship recycling adopted in 2013, which will soon enter into force following a ratification process by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). During these expert investigations, materials and products containing asbestos were found on some ships.
These stem from maintenance operations carried out by third parties or the deliveries of spares performed by unscrupulous suppliers which do not comply with the Group’s contractual conditions aimed at adhering to the regulations in force and prohibiting any installation of new equipment containing asbestos onboard the ships.
The Group immediately took measures to protect the crews, inform the relevant authorities (State flag, class, seafarers’ physicians and the Labour Inspectorate for vessels flagged under the French International Register (RIF)), and the CHSCT for French citizens.
French law has introduced an obligation
to search for asbestos prior to any work on materials and equipment likely to expose workers to asbestos. The terms and conditions of the preliminary search for asbestos are outlined in decree dated 9 May 2017, supplemented by orders specific to the maritime sector as well as an enforcing standard. CMA CGM is one of the ship owners which contributed to the preparation of this standard, and preliminary searches have already been carried out on the RIF- flagged ships.
An action plan is underway with support from an ad-hoc committee, the services of specialised companies accredited to remove these parts containing asbestos have been planned and the Group has also ordered regulatory inspections (e.g. measures to remove dust in the atmosphere). Dedicated personal protection equipment has been provided and the operating process of the ships includes the potential presence of materials containing asbestos on board. Asbestos has been prohibited onboard French vessels since 2002; however this prohibition is not in force in all countries. The ship building contracts and the contractual conditions for purchase of consumables for the ships clearly prohibit the presence of asbestos in the building process as well as the delivered parts. An “Asbestos free” certificate is supplied with new ships and part deliveries. Furthermore, since 2013, CMA CGM requires that classification companies perform asbestos surveys before delivery of the vessels built in Korea, China and The Philippines so as to verify that there is no asbestos on board.
APL receives Safety at Sea award at the Crew Connect Global Awards 2018
In November 2018 in The Philippines, APL received the Safety at Sea award at the Crew Connect Global Awards 2018. The award is a recognition of APL’s best practices and initiatives which led to the reduction of risk to human life at sea.
APL reaffirms the emphasis placed on safety onboard the vessels and at the terminals operated. “Throughsafetyprotocolsandtraining,APL encourages seafarers to adopt the right attitude towards safety management” said Dennis Yee, global head of safety, security and environment at APL.
APL adopts policies and processes that safeguard early detection, prevention and mitigation of associated risks to enable safe and secure operations.
In 2017, APL reported its 10th consecutive year of zero fatality and a very low injury frequency rate.
In addition, APL joins over 160 shipping companies to provide a worldwide safety network that assists search and rescue coordinators in responding to emergencies at sea.
3. Cargo security
The CMA CGM Group is commissioned to transport a wide variety of cargo that range from consumer products to dangerous goods, whether manufactured or not. Some cargo can represent a danger during transport, so the Group put in place a dedicated organisation to inspect, analyse and prevent risks related to the carriage of goods. For this purpose, the Group divides goods into three categories:
• Goods qualified as dangerous by international regulations (International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) code) or national laws (CFR49 – Code of Federal Regulations) that impose strict regulations on transport (packaging, segregation, temperature, stowing, etc.); • Potentially dangerous goods that require recommendations: chemicals in reefers, loading and admissibility of heavy goods, etc.
• Controlled goods subject to regulations on stopping or limiting motion (waste, protected species, etc.).
Moreover, in June 2016, the VGM (Verified
Gross Mass) international regulation took
effect and involves compulsory container
weighing prior to loading them on vessels.
This regulation is intended to prevent
accidents and loss of containers at sea.
The Group anticipated this regulation
and therefore modified its information
systems before the effective date, in order
to electronically incorporate the Verified
Gross Mass data of the container sent
by customers. This data is transmitted to
the relevant people at each stage of the 73 shipping process, thereby ensuring the
security of the shipping chain.
To manage dangerous goods, the Group has a dedicated computer application which is connected to the global booking IT system. This application which electronically incorporates the international regulation makes it possible to determine the way dangerous goods are declared then packaged and stowed in the container. As a means of managing and checking the 1 million 500 thousand requests received per year for the carriage of dangerous goods, the Group relies on a network of 7 dangerous goods offices that are strategically located worldwide to be close to our customers and reduce the processing time of these requests. As a matter of fact, for each dangerous goods request, the assigned dangerous goods office must check whether the request complies with the IMDG Code, our in-house procedures, the various port restrictions of the ports used during the carriage of said cargo and whether the dangerous goods are authorised by the charter party of the vessel(s) involved in the transport. If the goods must be loaded on
Excellence in safety and security 2018 Corporate Social ResponsIbility Report
Excellence in safety and security 2018 Corporate Social ResponsIbility Report

74
a partner vessel, then we must also check whether it is authorised by the partner procedures.
In early 2019, an improved upgrade of our IT application will make it possible to respond in almost real time to over 60% of the requests for the loading onto our vessels of dangerous goods under the Group’s shipping contracts while retaining the current level of safety. At present, the timeframe is approximately one working day.
With regard to potentially dangerous goods, i.e. which may represent a risk such as the out-of-size or conventional loads, reefers, flexitanks, poorly declared goods, the Group has provided its in-house customers with 3 experts who are tasked with providing safety advice to the lines and agencies.
As regards the goods with controlled movement, the 3 aforementioned experts are responsible for advising the lines, the agencies and the dangerous goods offices.
Finally, the CMA CGM Group uses its best endeavours to prevent unlawful carriage of goods in accordance with the various regulations and the Group’s Code of Ethics. This mainly relates to goods on the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) red list of threatened species, those covered by Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) or the Washington convention, the United Nations Convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, and various UN rules on embargoed goods.
4. International security
At sea
With the aim of preventing threats at sea and as a means of coping therewith, CMA CGM has developed a comprehensive range of operational, legal and human measures. These measures are constantly reassessed and tailored to the changing security context (piracy, traffic, etc.). Therefore, the risk of piracy is continuously monitored and analysed, and each solution is tailored to appropriately respond to the identified hot bed of piracy (West Africa, Indian Ocean, South-East Asia, etc.).
In 2018, approximately 266 piracy events were recorded worldwide, 223 of which included confirmed pirate attacks. Of these 223 attacks, most took place in South-East Asia and in West Africa. 4 CMA CGM vessels experienced acts of piracy over the elapsed year. 75
On land
For the past several years, CMA CGM has developed an overall inland security policy. This policy uses relevant and appropriate measures and equipment to reduce the exposure to security, health, natural and technological risks by the Group’s business activities and staff across the globe. Accordingly, CMA CGM seeks to optimally safeguard and protect everyone’s safety
For example, the countries around the world are categorised into various criticality levels, depending on the risks identified in each country. For each country, appropriate measures are introduced to secure the Group’s site as well as to protect the employees whether they are local, expatriates or on assignment. Within the Group, 85 countries have been categorised as high risk. Any traveller going to these countries must be registered with the Group Security Department, and briefed as applicable.
In 2018, some 1,000 visits to high-risk countries were managed in this way. Moreover, in 2017, the Group had to cope with over 70 situations directly involving its operations and/or staff, some of which required the set-up of an ad-hoc crisis unit. These situations related to natural disasters, armed conflicts, threats against a number of employees and emergency medical evacuation.
Active involvement of CMA CGM within the BASCAP
 The Group works closely with recognised organisations to fight against counterfeiting and arms trafficking, such as for example the BASCAP – Business Actions to Stop Counterfeiting & Piracy.
The Group is a founding member of the Cargo Incident Notification System (CINS), an information sharing platform for large maritime companies (70% of carried TEUs) that enables rapid notifications of security and safety issues with container-transported goods. This system has already significantly improved the quality of transporting goods in containers.

  To fight against false declarations, the 17 CINS member companies took the initiative to set up a joint system to detect poorly declared loads in order to improve the overall safety of container ships.
Cindex (inter-company expatriation centre) is a place for dialogue and sharing of good practices on international mobility strategies and policies by a network of major European groups. Each member benefits from the experience of the others, while maintaining full freedom of action and decisions, and observing absolute confidentiality. It is an informal network between peers, based on pooled knowledge and trust. The fact that Cindex co-opts its members guarantees a genuine sharing of concerns.

General Policy
Environmental protection is a key focus of the CMA CGM Group’s commit- ment to sustainable and responsible development. Major key issues for the Group include the conti- nued reduction of the global environmental footprint of all maritime and inland operations, regulatory compliance and above all the an- ticipation of future regulations, and the development of more eco-efficient logistics chains with its customers and partners.
Group’s strategy in terms of conventional fuels, LNG and the scrubbers system.
Development of the Customer Care Sustainability Program, including value-added services such as MyCarbon Footprint, the promotion of transport and logistics solutions or the commitment and cooperation through Sustainability pacts and the Clean Cargo Working Group.
No major oil pollution in 2018, however 138 containers were lost during a storm at sea in early 2018.
Continuation of the pro- grammes to reduce the impact of the vessels, especially as re- gards energy efficiency, reduc- tion of atmospheric pollution, underwater and ambient noise, liquid and solid discharges.
The Group was once again rewarded for its environmen- tal policy in particular via the French Ship Owners Association Blue Charter, customer awards as well as awards received in connection with voluntary port programmes worldwide.
     The CMA CGM Group’s environmental policy relies on 3 strategic axes:
• Air: climate change and air quality
• Oceans: ocean preservation and marine biodiversity
• Innovation: innovative and environmentally-friendly solutions
 Inauguration of CMA CGM ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPERY
In September 2018, CMA CGM inaugurated its flag ship, CMA CGM ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPERY, the largest container ship in the world flying the French flag:
• A 20,600-TEU (Twenty foot Equivalent Unit) capacity;
• End-to-end, the 20,656 TEUs represent a 123 kilometre long chain of containers;
• 400-metre long and 59-metre wide;
• Longer than 4 football fields and bigger than the Empire
State Building and the Eiffel Tower.

  Modern fleet, equipped with the latest technologies

CMA CGM ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPERY features the best eco-technologies:
• An electronic injection engine that significantly reduces fuel consumption (- 3% on average) and oil consumption (- 25%);
•An optimised hull and bow shape: The bulbus bow was therefore entirely redesigned to improve vessel penetration
CMA CGM chooses LNG

the FAL;
• A Becker Twisted Fin, a system placed
in front of the propeller and serving to improve water flows and significantly reduce the energy expenditure and CO2 emissions (- 4%);
• A system for the treatment of ballast water by filters and UV lamps used to release to the sea, water that is entirely free of living organisms and capable of impacting marine biodiversity;
•A shore power connection system for operationswheninport.
 The CMA CGM Group has decided to use Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to power its next nine giant 22,000-TEU ships which will be commissioned in 2020.
For the first time in the history of container shipping, a shipping company has made the ambitious choice of a cutting-edge technology for its large-capacity vessels.
The building of the first ship in the series was officially launched with the “steel cutting” ceremony held on 26 July at Jiangnan Shipbuilding in Shanghai, China.
GREEN SOLUTIONS DEVELOPED BY THE GROUP LNG
Containerships
CMA CGM has continued its external growth strategy with the acquisition of CONTAINERSHIPS. In early 2019, 4 new LNG-powered 1,400-TEU vessels will enter the fleet. This opportunity confirms our desire for innovation and our choices in favour of LNG and
also expands our skills and future experiences from building to the first bunkers.

Exhaust gas
treatment systems
On 30 March 2018, the Group took delivery of CMA CGM PREGOLIA, a 2,500-TEU Ice Class vessel assigned to the Baltic sea.
It is the first vessel of the fleet to be equipped with a scrubber. This investment is mainly driven by
the fact that the vessel will serve
at navigation zone exclusively situated in the Sulphur Emission Control Area (ECA). This system scrubs the exhaust gases, thereby capturing the Sulphur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) particles. These releases are then retained to be reprocessed on land. The fleet of scrubber-ready vessels has been supplemented with the entry into service of CMA CGM NEVA and CMA CGM LOUGA.

 1. AIR: Energy transition
By the very nature of the transport business, which relies heavily of fossile fuels, energy consumption remains a major issue. It is an economic, environmental and public health challenge for the Group and is carefully monitored by its various entities. The Group’s energy consumption is directly associated with the level of both greenhouse gas and polluting air emissions.
81
was the first year of reporting and each carrier has submitted the report of its CO2 emissions to the European Union. The Group has developed a dedicated reporting tool in order to ensure its compliance, in cooperation with the classification society ABS.
Alongside the European system, an IMO global CO2 emissions reporting system referred to IMO DCS (Data Collection System) will take effect in January 2019. These two systems will coexist as of 2019, however discussions are underway between the European Union and IMO to harmonise the two reporting systems.

Climate change is a major issue that in the long run will result in more technical, regulatory, financial and operational restrictions, yet will also give rise to new opportunities for responsible and sustainable marine transport.
The CMA CGM Group now holds market leadership for innovation in energy transition.
A. Energy consumption
- Another example of efforts to reduce energy consumption is CMA Ships’ limiting the capacities of the main engines of its largest vessels to adapt to the current navigation speeds.
- In 2018, the Group introduced a programme to install recovery boilers for the auxiliary engines (as for the main engine). Indeed instead of burning oil to produce the necessary steam, the boiler will recover the heat from the auxiliary engines exhaust gases, even when the main engine is shutdown. This technology has been installed on vessels.
The Navigation Support Centres’ role is to anticipate extreme weather events and advise Captains in choosing a route and minimising the consumption of our vessels. 3 “Fleet centers” covering all the time zones are manned 24/7 by seagoing personnel assigned to the shore-based facilities. Moreover, a Group operations department has been set up in order to optimise all the Group’s operations (maritime and operational management of the ships, decrease of port congestion, optimisation of the CMA CGM sea and land network).
B. Energy transition
a. CO2 target, 2018 achievement compared with the set target
According to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), CO2 emissions from shipping account for 2.2% of global CO2 emissions.
During the MEPC 72 meeting (Marine environment protection committee) held in April 2018, the IMO entered into an agreement regarding the reduction of CO2 emissions associated with the shipping industry, thereby contributing to involve the sector in the fight against climate change. This agreement sets a goal of– 50% of CO2 in 2050 versus 2008, a reduction in CO2 emissions per container of 40% in 2030 and 70% in 2050, and the strengthening of standards for new ships.
CMA CGM is well aware of its challenges and has therefore set a new ambitious goal of 30% less CO2 per carried container by 2025. Following the 50% improvement of its performance in relation to CO2 emissions per container and per kilometre between 2005 and 2015, the Group has already reduced its CO2 emissions per carried container by 15% since 2015.
As a reminder, in 2015 the European Parliament passed the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) regulation that requires companies to mandatorily report CO2 emissions in the direction of, to and within the European Union. 2018

In 2018, the fuel consumption for the CMA CGM Group’s maritime activity was 8,259 ktons, i.e. 6% higher than in 2017. With regard to energy efficiency, we reported a net improvement in the amount of fuel per container carried that equals a 3% decrease over 2017.
For many years now, the Group has conducted several initiatives to reduce fuel consumption which include replacing the fleet, monitoring consumption, reducing speed, optimising routes and improving propulsion and hydrodynamic technology.
- More specifically, in 2013, CMA CGM launched a programme to optimise its owned fleet primarily by modifying its bulbus bows. These changes were done in dry dock and help to maximise the ship’s hydrodynamics at applied speeds. 64 ships have already been modified, 4 of which in 2018. This innovation can cut fuel use and CO2 emissions by 5-10%. Moreover, there is also a propeller change programme whose design enables energy optimisation. In 2018, 25 propellers were changed.

  b. Overall assessment
of the Group’s CO2 emissions
The main source of greenhouse gas emissions of the CMA CGM Group is the combustion of fuel oil consumed by the vessels which represents more than 85% of the Group’s total energy balance. Energy consumption (mainly electricity) in relation to shore activities (agencies and terminals) is not significant in comparison with the consumption of the shipping fleet.
the Group are associated with the building of the vessels operated by the Group as well as the production of fuel oil used onboard the vessels. In 2018, scope 3 represented approximately 14% of the Group’s CO2 emissions.

of waste (solid and liquid) by the vessels, business trips taken by employees, the consumption of fuel oil specific to inland transport and the upstream phase of the production and transport of the consumed fuel.
83
C. Air pollution
In addition to CO2, the Group is very concerned about sulphur emissions, nitrogen oxides emissions and fine particulates. Since these emissions create issues for public health and air quality, increasingly stricter international and local regulations are being in force.
a. Global Sulphur Cap 2020
In October 2016, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) set a 0.5% cap for the sulphur contained in the fuel used onboard ships that will enter into force on 1 January 2020. This will reduce the quantity of sulphur oxide from vessels by 85% and should have a significant impact on improving air quality, particularly for the populations living close to ports and coasts. This regulation is subsequent to the implementation of Annex VI of the MARPOL convention for the prevention of air pollution from ships.
The Group has set up a dedicated working group (Countdown 2020 WorkGroup) aggregating representatives from many departments at the head office (Bunkering, Operational Management, Sales Representatives, Environmental Department, Legal Department, etc.) who are tasked with anticipating all the issues related with this new regulatory obligation to ensure compliance by the Group: purchase of fuel oil, cleaning of the tanks, procurement prospects, etc.
CMA CGM pre-empts and studies all technological solutions to ensure its compliance such as the use of low sulphur fuel, installing scrubber systems or any other alternative such as LNG propulsion.
> Test of new 0.5% sulphur content fuel oil formulations in cooperation with our suppliers;
> Ordering of 9 LNG-powered vessels;
> Delivery taken of three 2,500-TEU ships equipped with hybrid scrubber systems On 30 March 2018, the Group took delivery of CMA CGM PREGOLIA Ice Class, a 2,500- TEU vessels assigned to the Baltic line. It is the first vessel of the fleet to be equipped with a scrubber. The Group opted for a hybrid scrubber which can operate in open loop or in closed loop. This investment is mainly driven by the fact that the vessel will serve a navigation zone exclusively situated in the sulphur Emission Control Area (ECA). This system scrubs the exhaust gases, thereby capturing the sulphur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx)particles.Thesereleasesarethen retained to be reprocessed on land. The fleet of scrubber-ready vessels have been supplemented with the entry into service of CMA CGM NEVA and CMA CGM LOUGA. CMA CGM is conducting 3 pilot projects to install this technology on its large vessels. Indeed, even though this scrubber technology has been proven in the land industry, it must be adapted to
the high powers of our vessels.
In 2018, the average rate of sulphur in the fuel oil purchased by the Group was 2.42%.

Scope 3
Through the Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG), a discussion and collaboration platform, maritime carriers and major shippers are helping develop standard methods to calculate air emissions in the sector. The working group represents over 80% of container shipping capacity. CMA CGM has been an active member since 2003.
Based on the methodology set up within the CCWG and to meet regulatory requirements and customer needs, in 2008, CMA CGM set up a monitoring system for its CO2 emissions and performance (in g/TEU-km) which is checked by an independent accredited organisation. The CMA CGM Group (via APL) is a member of the CCWG executive committee.

b. Shore connection
In California, since 2014, local regulations require maritime companies to use shore power instead of using on-board engines. The initial threshold of 50% was increased to 70% in 2017, thereby reducing fuel consumption and inherent air emissions by an additional 20%. To ensure regulatory compliance of our vessels and calls, thirty of CMA CGM ships were equipped with alternative shore power systems.
Our vessels fited with this technology connect to shore in China on a voluntary basis in the ports which are equipped with this system. Due to this technology, some 28,000 tons of CO2, 14 tons of SOx and 35 tons of PM10 have not been released into the air.
The Group is studying the possibility of shore connection to standalone systems supplying the electricity produced on site with gas turbines.
84
c. Emission Control Areas
To date, there are 3 main areas where sulphur emissions from vessels are regulated: Northern Europe, North Amercia and, since 2018, China.
China has established Emission Control Areas (ECA) in its territorial waters, in order to handle the recurrent problem of air pollution. This environmental programme took effect on 1 April 2016 and requires vessels to use low sulphur fuel.
Since 1 April 2016, the Group’s vessels calling at the Shanghai, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Suzhou and Nantong ports must switch to a fuel with less than 0.5% sulphur content at anchorage and at berth.
Since 1 January 2018, the obligation to use 0.5% fuel oil has been generalised to all Chinese ports.
The next stage of the Chinese environmental programme will take effect on 1 January 2019. Indeed, all vessels shall be obliged to burn fuel oil with a sulphur content of maximum 0.5% whenever they enter the Emission Control Areas.
All of the Group’s vessels comply with the Chinese requirements, the necessary bunker purchases are anticipated in order to guarantee full compliance upon entry into force of the new requirements.

biofuels and hydrogen. Fuel cells, batteries and wind power are interesting options which must be considered as secondary or back-up sources.
The CMA CGM Group decided on LNG by ordering 9 LNG-powered 22,000 TEU vessels.
LNG has many environmental advantages in comparison to heavy fuel oil, such as the significant lowering of CO2 emissions, the absence of sulphur oxide (SOx) as well as the substantial reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and fine particulates.
As a true technological breakthrough in support of environmental protection, compared with the current fuel-powered vessels, LNG offers:
• Up to 25% reduction in CO2;
• The reduction of 99% of sulphur emissions; • The reduction of 99% of fine particulate emissions;
• The reduction of 85% of nitrogen oxide emissions.
The vessels powered by LNG will comply with IMO regulation aimed at reducing sulphur emissions as from 2020.
These new vessels are the culmination of over 7 years of work by our expert teams, and ship building engineers, our seagoing personnel as well as close cooperation with many technical and port partners.
Alongside the building of new vessels, CMA CGM carried out risk assessments in coordination with the shipyard, the classification society and stakeholders in the project to ensure proper conduct of the project particularly in terms of the environment. To guarante the smooth progress of the project, risk mitigation measures were listed and should be

In 2018, the fleet’s SOx and NOx emissions were respectively 400,000 tons and 699,811 tons.
D. Alternative energy
The IMO’s decisions to limit the sulphur content of the fuel used by vessels as of 1 January 2020 to 0.5% and the ambitious strategy recently adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% in 2050 have directed the sector towards the search for alternative solutions to conventional fuel. In fact, there is clear global phenomenon towards the reduction of CO2, NOx, SOx and particulate emissions.
In light of these challenges, energy transition is a major issue for the shipping industry as a whole and the CMA CGM Group in particular. The main challenges associated with the use of these alternative fuel solutions lie in the compatibility of their various environmental benefits with regard to pollution, the availability of the required quantities for the sector and the cost of the fuel.
The most promising solutions are LNG,

    implemented before the arrival of the first ship in the series scheduled for the first quarter of 2020.
A training programme in accordance with the codes in force has already been initiated to enhance the skills of all future seagoing staff who will be promoted on these giant ships. The documentary system is also being changed to include these new technical, operational and safety / environmental issues, associated with this technological development.
The prevention of these types of pollution is achieved through the equipment present on board, human management, all the operational and inspection procedures which have been put in place.
Firstly, the vessels are equipped with “SOPEP” (Ship Oil Pollution Emergency Plan) equipment comprising dispersants, rags, saw dust, protection goggles, shovels, buckets, portable pump, absorbent pads, gloves, bags, etc.
Liquid releases are controlled with instruments that comply with regulations, such as the oily water separator. It is used to control the maximum concentration of oil in the water released at sea when the vessel is en route, i.e. 15 ppm. Moreover, certain vessels feature a separator that is only 5 ppm. Human management and procedures are fundamental in the prevention of pollution.
The teams have entered into partnerships with:
• The Bataillon des Marins Pompiers (Naval Fire Brigade): firefighting and pollution exercises are organised on board as part of a commitment to continued improvement; • The Cedre (Centre de documentation, de recherche et d'expérimentations sur les pollutions accidentelles des eaux - Centre for documentation, research and experimentation on accidental water pollution). This centre is based in Brest (France) and CMA CGM personnel receives training there on an annual basis;
• Specific organisations, such as ECM, acting as the point of contact between the Group and the American Coast Guards.

and fauna
While the issue of protecting biodiversity mainly stems from managing the risk of liquid releases or solid waste at sea, container ships can potentially impact biodiversity due to the pollution caused to marine species.
a. Cetaceans and sea mammals
Several programmes have been set up in the United States and Canada for the protection of cetaceans. On the East coast, CMA CGM’s vessels must reduce their speed to maximum 10 knots in certain areas recognised as the breeding sites of cetaceans.
In addition, on the West coast of the United States, CMA CGM has voluntarily committed to the “Green Flag” speed reduction programme that was established in the sanctuary close to the Santa Barbara islands.TheLongBeachporthasrewarded CMA CGM for lowering the speed of its container ships with a compliance rate of almost 100%.
Furthermore, with support from the “Fleet Navigation Center”, the Group watches out for the areas where it is recommended to lower the speed of vessels. Whenever possible, the Group strives to lower its speed and thereby limit the risk of collision in these cetacean protection sanctuaries. – cf page 69 – Fleet Navigation Center: state- of-the-art technological resources.
 As part of a partnership with Yves Parlier and his company “Beyond the sea”, tests have been carried out to assess the feasibility of the Kite rig ship pulling system of the Group’s vessels.
2. OCEANS: preserving biodiversity
A. Accidental release to the sea and containers lost at sea
Accidental releases to the sea and in particular oil pollution from vessels or terminals operated by the Group are the biggest threat to the environment. A set of measures is in place to prevent this risk, such as fleet maintenance, routine drills and simulations between land and the vessels, and a strong crisis management policy. There are several types of marine pollution:
• Fuel;
• Oil;
• Chemicals; • Sludge.
According to the World Shipping Council38, 2,000 containers were lost at sea worldwide every year from 2006 to 2013 primarily due to difficult navigation conditions or a rare accident. In 2018, the CMA CGM Group recorded the loss of 139 containers at sea, of which 138 in a single event during a storm.
The loss of containers at sea is generally associated with the shipper’s declaring a lower weight of the container. The risk is also increased by bad weather. Every effort is made to prevent losing containers: weather watch, navigation centre, weather routing, onboard container security system. The CMA CGM Group began talks with Armateurs de France (French shipping association) and the relevant authorities to further reduce the risk of losing containers at sea. – cf page 73 – Cargo Security.

b. Endangered species
To limit the carriage of endangered species, the Group has set up procedures during the order intake process by which staff can give an alert to this type of cargo. – cf page 73 – Cargo Security
CMA CGM preempted the entry into force of this convention by installing ballast water treatment systems on most new vessels, thereby ensuring that the water released to the sea is fully free of any living organism which may affect the marine biodiversity.
The United States have also implemented local regulations on the treatment of ballast water. It approved 6 ballast water treatment systems that comply with American regulations, which are more stringent than international regulations. The CMA CGM vessels are equipped with approved systems and must treat their ballast water via one of these systems before releasing them into American waters.
The Group has put in place a schedule for installing the systems on its owned fleet, in accordance with the requirements of the international convention and American regulations. 81 vessels of the Group have already been equipped.
b. Other eco-technologies: FORS system, dual hull, additional tank for bilge water
In addition to the ballast water treatment system, the owned fleet features many technologies serving to limit its impact on biodiversity.
The “ FORS: Fast Oil Recovery System”, a pollution management technology, is a simple, reliable and safe system that can be used at any time, via a system of standardised connections, to quickly recover the oil located in the vessel bunkers in the event of grounding,. This technology has been installed on 57 vessels.
Up until 2010, the fuel oil of container ships was generally stored in tanks with a single hull. Since the MARPOL 12A rule (circa. 2010) took effect, they are now equipped with a double hull. As a matter of fact, the installation of a second wall, around the fuel tanks, prevents the risks of maritime pollution in the event of collision or piercing of the ship’s hull. Additional tanks, installed during the building of our new vessels, make it possible to better process bilge water and grey water.
3. Circular economy
Circular economy refers to an economic concept which forms part of sustainable development and which is aimed at producing goods and services while limiting consumption and the waste of raw materials, water and energy sources. As a shipping and logistics operator, CMA CGM is an active player of the circular economy by providing services at all phases involved in the transport of raw materials, intermediate and finished consumer goods as well as end-of-life products, depending on the needs of its customers. The Group pays special attention to the responsible use of resources, raw materials and consumables.

a. Ballast water treatment system
Ballasts are tanks filled with sea water located on both sides of a vessel which are used to ensure stability and structural integrity. The ballast water contains living species which, when released, may disrupt the balance of the local fauna and flora.
The IMO ballast water management convention adopted in February 2004 was ratified in 2016 and took effect on 8 September 2017. 88
A. Recycling solution and waste treatment process
A variety of waste is produced by the fleet:
•Solid waste made up of food waste, domestic waste, maintenance waste;
• Liquid waste from sewage, oily water and sludge.
a. Solid waste
The Group has committed to an innovative, environmentally-friendly and exemplary approach to exceed the requirements of the MARPOL regulation: the “Green Ship” Programme. All the Group’s owned vessels now take part in this programme, i.e. 179 vessels.
This initiative is structured around four key aspects:
➊ Selective sorting of all waste;
➋ The replacement of incinerators by
new-generation compactors, thereby
preventing the emission of polluting gases; ➌ The formal prohibition of disposing of
waste overboard (excluding food waste); ➍ Optimisation of waste recycling systems
on shore.
Therefore, the quantities of waste produced are monitored, updated and reported, and specific training sessions are conducted onboard the ships as well as on land.

 Environmental protection 2018 Corporate Social ResponsIbility Report

 In 2018, a ship produced an average of 10 m3 of solid waste per month.
The programme also enables vessels to share “good practices” or “issues encountered”. As such, the ports collecting the waste for recovery are listed by the type of waste they collect (ink cartridges, plastics, etc.); while other ports are not recommended. The goal is to draw up a central map of ports that provide the best selective sorting process.
In addition, the programme also makes it possible to set up waste treatment systems. This year, a mapping of the companies able to treat asbestos waste, as well as electrical and electronic waste, based on the best available techniques, had to be drawn up. This documentary system for the management of waste on board has been amended to take into account these 2 new types of special waste. In particular, it includes a module to train and inform seagoing personnel of these new risks for their health and the environment.
b. Liquid waste
Liquid waste is primarily due to the use of fuel oil. Vessels run on “residual” fuel that contains water and heavy metals. To be combustible, it has to be centrifuged on board. The centrifugation process requires water to be added to the water and heavy metals extracted from the fuel. All this waste creates “sludge” which is considered as hazardous waste. It is discharged on land and managed by land-based waste streams. CMA CGM takes care of the sludge generated by the owned fleet but it depends on the charter party for chartered vessels. It may be managed by the ship owner or the charterer.

as research with dismantling sites in Europe and Asia. The sites can be audited in accordance with the guidelines as stipulated in the Hong Kong Convention. It should be noted that the Group’s fleet is one of the youngest in the industry and the vessels are usually sold before their end of life. Nevertheless, whenever a vessel must be sent for dismantling, the Group takes measures to send it to a dismantling site that complies with international and local health, safety and environmental regulatory standards. In 2018, one Group vessel was sent to a certified site for dismantling in accordance with international standards, this vessel was the APL PHILIPPINES (aged 21 years).
C. Water consumption at the terminals
Water consumption is not a significant issue for the CMA CGM Group’s maritime transport activity. Indeed, water consumption on ships is neutral as sea water is pumped in, desalinated and treated for everyday uses on board.
For the Terminals, water consumption is mainly associated to the washing of handling vehicles, the quays and containers. Most of the sites are located close to other port industries which produce a lot of dust, thereby requiring frequent washing of the working environments. In 2018, within the Group’s scope of consolidation, total water consumption amounted to 214,896 m3.

 The waste production from the CMA CGM Group’s offices and branches is comparable to standard office activities. The waste generated at dry ports and terminals mainly involves non-hazardous waste (pallets, wood, shrink wrap) and accounts for less than 1,200 m3 per year within the Group’s scope of consolidation (Finance).

These eco-containers include three main technologies:
• Bambou flooring:
standard containers have wood flooring to receive goods. The wood used traditionally comes from an exotic tree that takes 60 years to mature and which is becoming increasingly rare nowadays. New wood species have been sought and bamboo was selected for its exceptional properties: bamboo grows back once it has been cut and
only requires 4 to 5 years to reach
maturity. At present, 14% of the
container fleet used by the Group
(owned and leased) is comprised
of containers with bamboo
flooring.
• Low-consumption reefers:
reefers are refrigerated containers that are
specially designed for the transport of food
and perishable goods requiring energy 91 and refrigerating gases. Low-consumption
reefers feature a more efficient motor
serving to reduce its electricity costs and
fuel consumption by a factor up to 3. At
present, 65% of the reefer fleet used by the
Group (owned and leased) is comprised of
low-consumption reefers.
• Light-steel containers:
light-steel containers are as
resistant as standard containers
but are lighter and therefore help
to optimise fuel consumption
and limit greenhouse gases as well as air pollution. At present, 3% of the container fleet used by the Group (owned and leased) is comprised of light-steel containers.
              A special team was put together in June 2015 to monitor the discharging of sludge which served to refine the method for assessing the quantity of sludge produced. For 2018, a ratio of 2.3% of the fuel oil consumed was defined to assess the total quantity produced.
The significant increase in water consumption is due to a broadening of the scope and the heightened exhaustiveness of data collection.

 4. Customer solutions A. Carbon optimisation studies
Transporting goods on container ships creates a lower ton-kilometre carbon footprint than other methods of transport.
To capitalise on this advantage, the environment department offers the Group’s lines technical support in order to add value to their offers of new maritime services. The goal is to quantify the excellence of the environmental performance with respect to other rival maritime or land solutions. For example, a study was conducted in order to promote the modal shift from road to “short sea” for a shipment of tomatoes in refrigerated containers between London and Morocco.
In addition to maritime transport and port operations, the CMA CGM Group designs and implements multi-modal logistics solutions and these pre- and post- shipmentsolutions enable the Group to offer customers comprehensive transport solutions that are also environmentally- friendly.
B. CO2 services for customers
Maritime transport customers are increasingly asking for environmental information on the services they buy. Customer requests concerning the environment and the CSR relate to approximately 20% of the total volume carried. The growing significance of the carbon footprint criterion when selecting their transport provider explains the Group’s efforts to offer a broadening range of premium customers tailored services that are focused on their various impacts.
This trend is manifested by the growing number of shippers joining the Clean Cargo Working Group. At the Autumn 2018 session, we noted the presence of major operators such as DECATHLON, LEVIS and PROCTER & GAMBLE as observers and who may integrate the working group in 2019.
As in previous years, the most frequent customer requests pertain to the carbon footprint of their shipments with CMA CGM. Historically, with a view to meeting this requirement, in 2011, the Group developed an eco-calculator that can estimate the carbon footprint for maritime transport between two ports. The eco-calculator is
92
Since 2013, in compliance with French legislation, for every booking, the customers connected to the e-commerce platform have been given a calculation and automatic display of the carbon footprint of their shipment both at sea and inland.
For the third consecutive year, the Group also provides a service of customised CO2 reports indicating the carbon footprint for all the bookings of an individual customer. In 2018, 85 customers of the Group selected based on the volume achieved as well as environmental involvement received an analysis of the breakdown of their total carbon emissions, by trade and by mode of transport.
The goal in the upcoming years is to develop these reports in a more dynamic format.
To ensure that we deliver highly reliable environmental data to customers, the methodology of all the CO2 information provided has been checked and certified by KPMG, acting as an independent third party.

For the customers that are more advanced in their CSR approach, the Group offers the signature of a sustainability pact. This non-legally binding document is the concrete expression of a principle agreement on the implementation between two signatories of all methods likely to minimise their common impact on the environment, such as the identification of “green corridors”. Moreover, the partners undertake to actively pursue synergies and opportunities for practical positive action in the community, wherever they are established.
In September 2018, a new pact was signed with PANALPINA. This is the 3rd agreement of this type signed between the Group and one of its customers, after Borouge and Schenker. 4 others are being prepared for 2019-2020.
The Panalpina pact is centred on 4 main thrusts: the environment (both partners have official carbon reduction goals for 2025 and will systematically strive to pursue any joint opportunity for timely achievement of these goals), the social policy within both groups, observance of an officially documented Code of Ethics and serious examination of the company’s role within the broader community.

5. Employee commitment A. Dedicated training
CMA CGM invests in training courses designed to make environmental protection an integral part of all business activities. Upon hiring, all the Group’s new employees receive safety and environment training for their particular job so that they can do their work in full compliance with these rules. Depending on their job, every employee then has to attend specific training modules for their field (for example: ISO 14001 for internal auditors, chemical risks for workers who handle chemicals, etc.).
Moreover, for all seagoing employees of the Group, a training schedule is determined based on the rank and employee’s potential impact on the environment. This training course is conducted through e-learning and each employee may connect to the programme on board as well as on land. Special seminars for officers are also routinely organised at the Group’s head office to inform, raise their awareness and train officers on issues relating to health, safety, security and the environment. The seminars are held twice per year at the head office.
An e-learning module that is accessible to all employees and which lists the key points of the Group’s environmental policy to be presented to customers, has been created on the Academy portal. This training module lasts 30 minutes and was taken by over 4,500 employees worldwide in 2018.
   B. Conferences and workshops
CSR Days: Environmental
conferences
On 5 June 2018, during the sustainable development week held at the head office, a conference open to all employees laid down the Group’s CSR policy.
This conference, which was followed by a question and answer session, was supplemented by two workshops intended more specifically for the Key Accounts sales teams. The aim was to inform these teams, who are in contact with the Group’s largest customers, of the environmental projects as well as the latest technological developments to be put forward. – cf page 21 CSR days: raising the awareness of employees to the Group CSR approach.
  Sulphur CAP 2020 conference
On 25/10 and 9/11 2018, two conferences were organised for the pricers of the lines, and the key accounts sales teams in charge of calls for tenders, in order to review the regulatory obligations concerning sulphur emissions for 2020 and the direct consequences on their jobs, especially as regards the inclusion of BAF (Bunker Adjustment Factor) clauses in sales contracts.
 6. Awards and
certifications
The Group helps to further a large number of voluntary initiatives that contribute to preserving the environment and as such is recognised for its commitment each year by
95
 both customers and local authorities.
A. Voluntary environmental initiatives
The CMA CGM Group is an active member of diverse environmental programmes focused on ocean preservation, the protection of fauna and air quality.
Below are some of the highlights of 2018:
•The CMA CGM Group was honoured by ISO 14001 in Spain, Green Flag in California, Clean Vessels Incentive in New York and Blue Circle in Vancouver;
• Environmental Ship Index - ESI. The Group has been taking part in this initiative for several years in 14 ports in Europe, the United States and in Asia. In 2018, two new agreements were signed with the Port of Marseilles/Fos and the Port of Pointe des galets in Reunion Island.
    ESI Focus – Environmental Shipping Index
WPCI – World Ports Climate Initiative is an initiative that was launched by the main ports worldwide, which have committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions via the ESI – Environmental Ship Index. The ESI is a platform that collects and rates the environmental information of ships regarding greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants. Based on the data that is updated quarterly, the ports “reward” the vessels with the highest performance. It should be noted that the ports of Longbeach (Green Flag Incentive Programme), New York (Clean Vessels Incentive Programme) and Vancouver (Blue Circle) rely on the ESI rating to reward the ships with the highest performance based on their own local programmes.
Between 1 May and 15 November 2018, CMA CGM took part in a voluntary campaign to reduce the speed of ships which was organised by the NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS).
The goal was to reduce the speed of vessels to maximum 10 knots in the breeding sanctuaries of sea mammals on the West coast of the United States in order to avoid collisions.

It helps these regions to develop economically and socially by making investments to create jobs and additional business opportunities. Alongside its business activity, the Group has embarked upon a civic approach through the provision of financial and in-kind support to NGOs and local associations via the Foundation as well as employee initiatives. Moreover, the Group also takes part in solidarity initiatives during natural disasters through the implementation of emergency action projects.
1. The CMA CGM
Foundation
Mrs Naïla Saadé started the CMA CGM Foundation in 2005 to sponsor advocacy projects for children. Since its inception, it has helped over 200 associations. Its mission is to foster personal development for disabled children, improve the daily life of children with illnesses and trauma victims and promote equal opprortunity for disadvantaged youths; through the the “Containers of Hope” campaign, it is helping humanitarian transport operations for the most vulnerable children all over the world.
A. Containers of Hope
In 2018, the Foundation resumed its humanitarian transport campaign, Containers of Hope, which provides NGOs with maritime transport for around one hundred containers per year on the CMA CGM Group’s ships to deliver aid to populations in conflict zones or areas exposed to health and humanitarian threats. The first campaign was launched in October 2012 with Action against Hunger and Doctors Without Borders and then
expanded in 2014 to include the French Red Cross and other NGOs which so request.
Since the start of the campaign and the end of 2018, 700 containers carrying 5,000 tons of humanitarian supplies have been transported to partner NGO programmes in some thirty-five different countries, primarily in Africa. The supplies have helped to fight against infant malnutrition, improve access to water and satisfy the healthcare needs of the most vulnerable populations and mostly children.

B. Call for projects
18 associations were supported in France and Lebanon in 2018 via a call for projects and the awarding of the Foundation Prize.
In 2018, the Foundation continued to back projects helping at-risk children in France and Lebanon. As part of this effort, it launched its sixth themed call for projects focused on promoting
the equal opportunity of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The various projects of these associations will provide assistance to 8,000 children.
Of the 180 applications received, the Board of Directors ultimately selected 16 associations (10 French and 6 Lebanese), awarding a total of € 220,300:
Lebanon:
> Société Saint-Vincent-de-Paul: renovation and modernisation of the library to transform it into a documentation centre.

The Foundation is committed to supporting local actions carried out in the areas surrounding the CMA CGM Tower. Indeed, one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Europe, the 3rd arrondissement in Marseilles, is located near to the head office. Three public elementary schools in this district applied to the Foundation for the organisation of nature trips (classes vertes) and ski trips for the various classes. Many pupils live below the poverty line and have never been outside of their disadvantaged neighbourhoods. These schools, through the OCCE13 association, will receive subsidies which will allow over 200 children to be able to experience a complete change of scenery and discover other horizons.
Set-up of the skills-based sponsorship program.
In 2018, the CMA CGM Group also launched the skills-based sponsorship programme through its Foundation.
Within this context, a test phase was initiated for a group of 10 CMA CGM employees, based in Marseilles. These employees got the opportunity, during their working time (paid for by the Group), to spend two half-days working alongside a partner association, from the month of September to late December 2018. – cf page 50 – Skills- based sponsorship program
Many associations are in need of administrative, technical, organisational and support expertise. The volunteers provide their skills in these areas.
D. Other local actions:
Support of 3 elementary schools in Marseilles
    C. Awarding of the Foundation Prize
The Foundation awarded its 2018 Prize to two associations working for disadvantaged children.
To mark the 10th anniversary of its Prize, the CMA CGM Foundation decided to call on a prestigious patron: Martine Vassal, President of the Bouches-du-Rhône Local Council and President of the Aix- Marseilles-Provence Metropolitan Area. On 29 November 2018 at the CMA CGM Tower in Marseilles (France), Martine Vassal and Naïla Saadé, President of the CMA CGM Foundation, presented the 2018 Foundation Award to the heads of the Ecole des XV association. This Award recognises the work carried out by this association to fight against school drop- out and school failure amongst secondary
school pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, by offering them an after- schoolprogrammeassociatinghomework assistance, tutoring and rugby sessions.
In Lebanon, the 2018 Foundation Award was presented to Arcenciel, on 26 December, during a ceremony held at CMA CGM head office in Beirut. Since 1985, Arcenciel has been contributing to the sustainable development of the Lebanese society by providing support to fragile populations and working towards the integration of marginalised people. 50,000 people have received assistance from this organisation and pioneer of social and solidarity-based economy in Lebanon. All their projects include the consideration of people with difficulties, the preservation of natural resources, business profitability and financial independence.
 In 2018, the skills sponsorship programme allowed employees from the Group to lend their expertise to four associations based in Marseilles:
•Relais Enfants-Parents helps to foster relationships between incarcerated parents and their children;
 • Ecole des XV fights against school drop- out through rugby;
•SOS Méditerranée organises rescue operations in the Mediterranean sea;
• Secours Populaire has been fighting
against poverty since 1945.

Partnership with the Télémaque Institute
As part of the same effort to foster the engagement of employees, the CMA CGM Foundation set up a partnership with the Télémaque Institute in connection with its 2018 call for projects. This association works to promote equal opportunity in education from the secondary school level by assisting deserving and motivated youth from disadvantaged backgrounds via a dual “company-school” sponsorship (for each young person: a mentor at the company + a supervisor in his or her school).
The goal of this support is to enable these young people to broaden their social and cultural horizons and learn about the working world and to encourage them to stay in school and develop self-confidence.
Through this partnership, the Foundation offered 5 Group employees the chance to mentor one young person during their free time for a renewable period of one year. Mentors help their mentees to develop their potential and to open up to the cultural and business world so that they can have all the opportunities that they deserve. This takes place along three lines:
- By offering them cultural and sporting outings (museums, theatre, sports game, etc.) once per month;
- By teaching mentees about their job, encouraging the mentees to think about their own career path and meet other professionals; - By encouraging mentees to believe in themselves and to aim for studies that are in line with their potential.
Tragic incident at Rue d’Aubagne in Marseilles
The Foundation also responds to emergency situations.
The CMA CGM Group was very affected by the tragedy that occurred on 5 November at rue d’Aubagne in Marseilles and, via its Foundation, was keen to express its full- fledged solidarity to the victims and those most affected. This support was provided through:
• a donation of EUR 1,500 to Destination Familles, an association located in rue d’Aubagne which works for social cohesion in the Noailles district. This donation will be paid over in full to the family of a child who lost a parent in the incident;
• a donation of EUR 10,000 to Croix-Rouge française intended to assist the families who have been relocated;
 • a donation of EUR 30,000 over three years to the Fondation Abbé Pierre Provence Alpes Côte d’Azur to work towards a sustained action against poor housing conditions.
International Day of Persons with Disabilities
In 2018, the Foundation organised events for supported associations and CMA CGM employees.
On October 9, 2018, on the International Day for Persons with Disabilities, the Foundation organised a Round-Table Discussion at the Head Office in Marseilles centered on disabilities. 20 Marseilles employees took part in this discussion and shared their views on improving the daily life of persons with disabilities, and their families, as well as the difficulties encountered for their inclusion into the workforce and how hard it is to assert yourself when you are disabled.
Forum of associations
On November 29, on the same day as the Fondation France Prize giving ceremony, a first edition of the Forum of associations was held in the CMA CGM Tower.
Of the 10 French associations whose applications won the 2018 call for projects, nine came to present their actions to the CMA CGM employees and offered volunteer missions. This forum was well received and was an opportunity for interaction and the sharing of views between the associations and employees.
E. Cultural sponsorship
The Foundation remains loyal to sponsoring cultural events.
In 2018, it once again supported educational activities at the Aix-en-Provence Festival. It sponsored Bach’s Mass in B minor by the “collegium musicale choir corelli baroque orchestra” and Gianluca Marciano, at the Festival Al Bustan; the concert given by Mathieu Chedid at the Baalbeck Festival and, as part of the Festival International de Piano de La Roque d’Anthéron, it sponsored the piano recital given by Nelson Freire and Sinfonia Varsovia (Mozart) in the Parc du Château de Florans. 50 tickets for this recital were offered to CMA CGM employees.
2. Actions carried out within local communities
For CMA CGM, local action involves a voluntary, one-off or recurrent initiative, carried out by a CMA CGM entity, involving CMA CGM employees, that has an environmental, social or societal theme and which directly impacts the local communities in which the Group or its subsidiaries carry out their operations.
This year, the Group was involved in over 38 local community actions across 20 countries, i.e. 90% more local actions reported compared with 2017.
The following map shows a few of the 2018 initiatives, with the countries where the Group carried out the action shown in blue:
 
 Below are a few examples of initiatives carried out in 2018:
• In August 2018, the Kerala region in India was severely affected by flooding. The CMA CGM Group carried a container filled with basic necessities such as food and medication to assist the victims.
• In October 2018, after a tsunami hit Indonesia, CMA CGM Indonesia rallied to help the victims: the employees on site
In times of crisis, the CMA CGM Group works in conjunc- tion with governments and humanitarian organisations worldwide to provide aid to affected populations and meet their immediate basic needs. The CMA CGM teams strive to make a difference in the lives of extre- mely vulnerable populations and demonstrate their wil- lingness to assist those most in need by providing logis- tics expertise for the transport of aid and by collecting donations in kind such as water, food and clothing.
raised 15 million Indonesian Ruppies to buy products such as food, water and hygiene products. These goods were transported by CMA CGM to be distributed to the affected areas.
• In Saipan, devastated by the super typhoon Yutu in October 2018, the Group transported a cargo of emergency aid which was received by the Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

 Humanitarian Services Office
In late 2017, CMA CGM decided to create the Humanitarian Services Office to offer international organisations and NGOs a single point of contact. This office allows the Group to offer “tailored” solutions to these emergency organisations, such as:
• Giving them direct access to CMA CGM’s services and global network of agencies;
• Centralising and rationalising their specific transport needs and requirements;
• Providing them with professional advice by leveraging on the Group’s experience and expertise in handling logistics issues;
• Offering them guidance in the shipment of humanitarian aid supplies, via appropriate transport methods, reliable end-to-end solutions and procedures at competitive prices;
• Helping them to maximise the effect of the aid they provide and take part in their mission to overcome humanitarian crises.
Since the Humanitarian Services Office was launched, NGOs and international organisations have praised the initiative and have worked with the office on a daily basis to devise appropriate solutions. In 2018, the office enabled the humanitarian transport of 10,665 twenty-foot equivalent (TEU) containers.

CSR goals, 2018 achievements, directions
The aim of the Group in 2018 was to enhance the CSR approach. Therefore, the following table outlines for each of the Group’s CSR thrusts and challenges, the main goals, the results for 2018 and the directions.

Finally, as the reporting methodology has changed in relation to calculation of e-learning hours, the 2017 data was not reused; as it cannot be compared with the 2018 values.
Period: The reporting period is from 01/01/2017 to 31/12/2017 and from 01/01/2018 to 31/12/2018.
Methodological note
Social :
Social indicators were defined in 2013 and updated in 2018. Established based on GlobalReportingInitiative(GRI)criteriaand designed to meet French legal requirements (NRE Act of 15 May 2001 and Article 225 of the enforcing decree dated 24 April 2012), while including current international maximum standards.
Scope:
The reporting of the CMA CGM Group’s non-financial data pertains to a consolidated scope (excluding French and international seagoing personnel).
The Total Workforce and breakdown of workforce per region indicators apply to the consolidated entities in the global scope as of 31 December of the reference year. Gender, Age, Hiring & Departure indicators are made available for a limited portion of the consolidated scope because some subsidiaries have not been reported.
• Gender and geographical area - Information available for 81% of the Group consolidated workforce
C&Me reporting tools (excluding seag-oing personnel and international employees scope):
The indicators are collected and consolidated by the HR C&Me information system. C&Me relates to 81% of the Group consolidated workforce. Excel spreadsheets supplement the reporting for the office- based employees – relate to 6% of the Group workforce.
Workforce:
Note 1 : The workforce broken down per individual relates to the Group consolidated world scope as of 31 December of the reference year. They include employees with an employment contract at one of the CMA CGM Group‘s companies as of 31 December of the reference year. The following are included: indefinite-term work contracts, fixed-term work contracts, expatriates (by site of secondment), employees on maternity or paternity leave, interns and VIE participants (excluding France).
Note 2 : The workforce broken down by gender includes the percentage of male employees and the percentage of female employees. The distribution by age is broken down as follows: younger than 20 years old, 20 to 29 years old, 30 to 39 years old, 40 to 49 years old, 50 to 59 years old, 60 years and older. These categories were established based on available data. Some branches and subsidiaries do not report due to specific local regulatory constraints (or inclusion in scope).
Note 3 : The breakdown of workforce by geographic area pertains to the following categories: France, Europe (excluding France), Africa – Middle-East, the Americas, Asia – Oceania.
Hirings and dismissals:
Note 1 : Hiring pertains to the number of employees who joined the company between 01 January and 31 December of the reference year, depending on the contracts as defined in Note 1 / Workforce. Someone is also considered a new hire in their company when they are reassigned and signed a new employment contract with a different company within the Group or have an amendment to the original contract that results in a permanent assignment to a different Group company.
115
• Hiring & Departures - Information available for 81% of the Group consolidated workforce
Methodological Note 2018 Corporate Social ResponsIbility Report

Note 2 : Dismissals relate to the number of employees leaving the workforce due to the company’s decision between 01 January and 31 December of the reference year, employees under contract. This includes redundancies, dismissals for actual and serious cause, dismissals for gross misconduct, dismissals for unfitness (further to a work accident, occupational disease) or for non-professional reasons. The dismissal rate is calculated based on the number of dismissed persons / total workforce.
Training
Note 1 : All types of training courses are included (internal and external) and all training methods (classroom, e-learning) are counted, as long as the training action contains an educational objective, is tracked and is administered by an employee of the CMA CGM Group.
•The classroom-based training courses are taken into account as of 1 hour. The calculation is based on the hours of training provided to employees and not the planned or budgeted hours.
• The e-learning courses (interactive content) is calculated as from 4 minutes, and the 116 educational videos as from 30 seconds of connection. The calculation of the e-learning hours are tracked based on the hours completed, unless the connection time is not consistent (i.e. more than 2 x the theoretical time and 1.25 for IMDG). In this case, the theoretical duration is reported. /!\ - Caution: as the methodology changed for calculating the e-learning training time, the 2018 data cannot be compared with
the 2017 data.
Regarding French Crewing: The payroll tool specific to French Crewing is used to obtain all the information concerning the HR data of the French seafarers.
Regarding International Crewing: The workforce counted in the International Crewing HR indicators correspond to seafarers with a permanent employment contract or a contract with CMA CGM or all its subsidiaries: these seafarers work on the vessels of the CMA CGM Group fleet, the vessels of other shipowners, which carry out one-off jobs at the other entities of the Group. If the shore-based assignment is definitive (via a change of contract), the employee is therefore counted in the shore- based workforce.
Training of French and international Crewing: The number of training hours for the French and international seagoing personnel corresponds to the sum of the number of e-learning training hours, added to the number of classroom-based training hours:
• The number of classroom-based training hours is obtained by applying an average duration of 7 hours of training per day of training administered
• The number of e-learning training hours is obtained via the online training software
Note: the change in the number of training courses between 2017 and 2018 is primarily associated with the change in the calculation method.
Safety
Workplace safety: Fatal accidents and accidents with leave longer than 1 day are tracked and consolidated at the Group level by CMA Ships, for the owned fleet maritime activity, and by CMA CGM HO SSE Terminals, for terminals under management. Accidents that occurred on chartered vessels are not reported or consolidated, since they are under the responsibility of the respective ship owners.
Frequency rate of maritime work accidents:
LThe frequency rate for work accidents is calculated for the maritime scope (fleet owned by CMA Ships) based on the number of accidents with sick leave and the total number of hours worked.
It includes accidents among the seagoing staff employed by the Group, as well as the seagoing staff employed by Manning agencies. An accident with leave is considered to be any accident that results in leave from work onboard ship. Accidents that result in work leave only after disembarkment are not taken into account.
Number of hours worked of the shipping activity: sum of the actual number of days on board x 24 hours
Frequency rate = number of work accidents / (number of hours worked) x 1,000,000.
The number of hours worked corresponds to the number of hours spent on board including at night, hence a low frequency rate with respect to other industries.
Severity rate of maritime work accidents:
Number of days’ sick leave further to a workplace accident per thousand of hours worked over a period of twelve sliding months. For seagoing staff which are no longer in the workforce as of 31/12/reference year, the days of leave which occurred during the reference year are not taken into account in the calculation of the severity rate.
Frequency Rate of accidents with bodily injury with sick leave for terminal employees: The frequency rate is calculated over the scope of the terminals subject to the CMA CGM Corporate Terminals QHSSE policy as of the number of work accidents with sick leave of more than 1 day and the total number of hours worked. FR = (number of accidents / number of hours worked) x 1,000,000
Scope of the terminals subject to the CMA CGM HO Terminals SSE policy: Dutch Harbor APL Terminal Unalaska / Kingston Freeport Terminal / SAMR La Réunion / GMM Martinique / GMG Jarry Terminal Guadeloupe / SOMARIG Guyane / TGO Montoir / TDF Dunkerque / BKP Odessa / Medeurope Terminal Marseilles / Marseilles Manutention / Malta Freeport Terminal / Terminal Sevilla / Thessaloniki / Lattakia / Umm Qasr Berth n°5 / Casablanca / Kribi / Mundra / Yokohama /

Environnement
The reporting period runs from 01 January 2018 to 31 December 2018.
Maritime fuel oil consumption: The fuel oil consumption is monitored for the entire fleet in operation. Fuel oil consumption for land activities are considered insignificant in comparison. The fuel oil consumption of the maritime activity is expressed in tons of fuel oil and represents the total consumption of different types of fuel oil used by the fleet (HSFO / LSFO / MGO-DO).
Q consumed per voyage = ∑ ROB beginning voyage – ROB end of voyage + ∑ voyage bunkers purchase
Maritime CO2 emissions: : The CO2 emissions relate to the entire operated fleet and are expressed in tons of CO2. They are directly calculated from fuel oil consumption. The following emission factors are applied to fuel oil consumption for the maritime activity: •1tonHFO=3.114tonsofCO2 •1tonLFO=3.151tonsofCO2 •1tonMGO/DO=3.206tonsofCO2
Ref.: “RESOLUTION MEPC.245(66) 2014 117 GUIDELINES ON THE METHOD OF
CALCULATION OF THE ATTAINED ENERGY
EFFICIENCY DESIGN INDEX (EEDI) FOR
NEW SHIPS”
Definition of Scope 3:
Scope 3 emissions are emissions resulting from the building of vessels and containers, vessels solid and liquid waste production, employees business trips, fuel oil consumption specific to the pre- and post-shipment services and upstream emissions stemming from the actual production and transport of fuel burnt on our vessels.
• Ship building: For each vessel built in the year, we consider the weight of the vessel (no ballast, fuel, oil, cargo) in tons and we apply an emission factor of 1.75 (1.75 tons of CO2 emitted to produce 1 ton of steel);
• Container building: For all the containers built during the year on behalf of CMA CGM, we consider the empty weight (tare weight of a twenty-foot container = 2.2 tons) and we apply an emission factor of 1.75 (1.75 tons of CO2 emitted to produce 1 ton of steel);

• Solid waste: Owned vessels take part in our Green Ship programme. Within this context, they report the solid waste produced. We apply an emission factor of 182 kg of CO2 for 1 m3 of waste to the total volume of solid waste reported;
• Liquid waste: mainly sludge produced by the vessel. For 2018, the estimated sludge produced was 2.3% of the consumed fuel oil, therefore we consider 2.3% of CO produced. 2
• Employee business trips: the CMA CGM Group in-house travel agency supplies the CO2 emissions stemming from trips (train / plane) of the Group business travellers outbound from France. This corresponds to the Head Office scope.
• Fuel oil consumption for pre- and post- shipment services: we extract this information from the Group’s booking management system with a transport mode criterion = Barge / Rail / Road / Third-Party Feeder which incorporates the transport carried out on behalf of the Group by external service providers. We then apply the standard emission factors for each transport mode in order to calculate the corresponding carbon footprint. (Source: CO2 emission of transport services, Methodological Guide / Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy. 2017 for rail, road and barge; CMA
118 CGM Source for feeder).
• Upstream phase fuel emissions: we use
the emission factors of the EcotransIT base
which applies the default factors of the
EN16258 standard. For the MDO: 0.68 kg
time. NOx emissions are expressed in tons of NOx.
NOx = total fuel consumption by type * NOx emission factor by type of fuel
The following emission factors are applied to the fuel consumption for the maritime activity:
•HSFO/LSFO:86kgofNOx/tonsoffueloil •DO:56kgofNOx/tonsoffueloil
(Source: 3rd IMO GHG study 2014)
Accidental releases: Accidental releases relate to unintentional releases of hazardous or non-hazardous liquid discharges from the owned vesselsl, whether or not the CMA CGM Group is liable. The reporting scope pertains to the owned fleet of the Group and is based on the feedback from the Report of Notification (RON) sent in by the vessels.
Solid waste: The volume of solid waste (hazardous and non-hazardous) is reported by the ships based on waste reduction programme called “Green Ship”. Each vessel sends a summary by category of solid waste generated on board on the basis of the crew’s visual estimation. They are expressed in m3 or in pieces, depending on the category. These reports are then compiled and the figures are analysed to determine the total volume of waste generated by the owned fleet. Sludge is not taken into account in this indicator.
Sludge: The production of sludge covers the entire operated fleet. Sludge is expressed in tons. The quantity of sludge is calculated using a ratio that is calculated annually by the Sludge team based on the quantities discharged and inspected during the sludge unloading operations. This ratio is applied to the total quantity of fuel oil burnt over the year in order to calculate the quantity of sludge produced.
Terminal energy consumption: The energy consumption of the Terminals relates to the Terminal activity subject to the CMA CGM HO Terminals SSE policy.
Terminal water consumption: The Terminal water consumption pertains to the Terminal activity subject to the CMA CGM HO Terminals SSE policy
Scope of Terminals subject to the CMA CGM HO Terminals SSE policy: Dutch Harbor APL Terminal Unalaska / Kingston Freeport Terminal / SAMR La Réunion / GMM Martinique / GMG Jarry Terminal Guadeloupe / SOMARIG Guyane / TGO Montoir / TDF Dunkerque / BKP Odessa / Medeurope Terminal Marseilles / Marseilles Manutention / Malta Freeport Terminal / Terminal Sevilla / Thessaloniki / Lattakia / Umm Qasr Berth n°5 / Casablanca / Kribi / Mundra / Yokohama / Kaohsiung / VICT Vietnam / Natal
CSR challenges
The identification of the major CSR challenges for the Group was developed in partnership with various Group departments: Environment, Security, Safety, Human Resources, Ethics & Compliance, Purchasing Risk.
An initial list of material CSR challenges for the maritime transport sector was drawn up using a documentary and regulatory analysis.
The following challenges were identified:
• Business ethics: Economic sanctions and embargoes, free competition, corruption, conflict of interests, fraud, data confidentiality and protection
• Value chain: Customer Centricity, Innovation and sustainable added value, Long-term partnerships with our suppliers
• Social: Diversity – Mixity & inclusion, Employee working conditions, employee development
• Safety and security: maritime safety, occupational safety (H&S), goods safety, safety of assets, international security
• Environment: Energy, Resources, Materials & Waste, Pollution and releases, Oceans: biodiversity
• Societal: Territorial development and integration, sponsorship, local actions, philanthropy, Emergency Relief
Assessment of importance for CMA CGM
Each of the challenges determined is assessed by the various departments based on 4 criteria: finance, legal/regulatory, Operation/ Business, Image/Reputation. The challenges were then ranked by priority depending on the following criteria:
+++: CMA CGM identified the importance of CSR challenges and has made them one of its priorities. The Group implements the necessary resources to address this challenge ++: CMA CGM has identified that this CSR challenge is important and has put actions in place
+: CMA CGM has identified that this CSR challenge is not a priority for the moment, and has implemented limited actions / or has not put any actions in place for the moment
Assessment of importance for CMA CGM stakeholders
For this assessment, the stakeholders were not directly contacted. The stakeholders have been identified depending on the interest in the Group’s activities. They are divided into 2 sub-groups:
Priority stakeholders: Government, Public Authorities, Investors, Customers, Shareholders, Employees / Trade Unions, Suppliers, Subcontractors
Secondary stakeholders: NGOs, Media, Professional organisations, Local communities The challenges were then ranked by priority based on the following criteria:
+++: The stakeholder has determined that the CMA CGM CSR challenge is a fundamental challenge from its standpoint
++: The stakeholder has determined that the CMA CGM CSR challenge is secondary from its standpoint
+: The stakeholder has determined that the CMA CGM CSR challenge is not a priority for the moment from its standpoint
Note: In 2018, 80 Group and subsidiary employees and 4 customers were surveyed and gave their views on the CMA CGM CSR approach.
> therefore, the risk is more important than the challenge itself, given the procedures and work underway.
CSR risks
CO e/kg;fortheHFO:0.26kgCO e/kg. 22
- Based on the activity and the scope,
several risks have been grouped into a “risk
category”, of which the current risk level is 119 defined by the average of the frequencies
and the average of the severity rates.
- If a challenge is covered by 2 risk categories, the final risk level is the higher of the 2 categories.
http://www.ecotransit.org/download/ETW_ Methodology_Background_Report_2016.pdf (p. 96).
> Comparing the assessments of the challenges vs the risks. In this exercise, differences were identified and explained as follows:
SOx emissions: SOx emissions cover the entire operated fleet. SOx emissions are expressed in tons of SOx. SOx emissions are calculated based on fuel oil consumption per type of fuel oil, average ratio of sulphur concentration per type of fuel oil, emission factors between sulphur and SOx: 2 t of SOx are emitted for every 1 t of sulphur (S) in the fuel oil. (Source: EEMS Atmospheric Emissions Calculation).
The sulphur ratios are taken from data from the fuel purchasing and management control department and from 2018 Bunker Delivery Notes (BDNs). An average sulphur ratio weighted by the quantity is calculated for each type of fuel oil.
NOx emissions: NOx emissions cover the entire operated fleet. NOx emissions for land activities are considered insignificant in comparison and are not consolidated at this
-
-
The challenge is higher than the position of the risk: the challenge is strong and known. CMA CGM has undertaken actions to limit the risk inherent to the challenge > therefore, the risk is controlled and the challenge remains strong.
The challenge is less than the position of the risk: the challenge is emerging. CMA CGM is implementing actions to mitigate the risk
With support from the Risk Management Department, a CSR risk mapping in connection with the materiality matrix is being prepared. The 2018 work involved:
> Identifying the existing Group risks in connection with one of the 15 Group CSR challenges and determining the challenges with no associated risks
> Compiling the “CSR” risk mapping for the risks and associated challenges. The rules applied are:

 Report by the Statutory Auditor

Report by one of the Statutory Auditors, appointed as an independent third party, on the consolidated non-financial performance statement in the Management Report
For the year ended December 31st, 2018
To the Annual General Meeting
In our capacity as Statutory Auditor, appointed as an independent third party, of CMA CGM S.A., certified by the French Accreditation Committee (Comité Français d'Accréditation or COFRAC) under number 3-104943 , we hereby report to you on the consolidated non-financial performance statement for the year ended 2018 (hereinafter the “Statement”), included in the Group Management Report, in accordance with the legal and regulatory provisions of Articles L.225 102-1, R. 225-105 and R.225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).
Responsibility of the Company
It is the Management Board's responsibility to prepare a Statement in accordance with legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of policies applied to mitigate these risks and the outcomes of those policies, including key performance indicators.
The Statement has been prepared applying the procedures of the Company, (hereinafter the “Guidelines”), the most significant aspects of which are presented in the Statement and available upon request at the Company’s headquarters.
Independence and quality control
Our independence is defined by the provisions of Article L.822-11-3 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Moreover, we have implemented a quality control system that includes documented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable ethical rules, professional standards, laws and regulations.
1.Statutory Auditor’s responsibility
On the basis of our work, it is our responsibility to express a limited assurance opinion about whether:
• the Statement complies with the provisions of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce);
• the information provided (hereinafter the “Information”) is fairly presented in accordance with Article R.225-105-I and II of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) concerning policy outcomes, including key performance indicators and actions relating to the main risks;
It is our responsibility to express, at the request of the Company and outside of the scope of accreditation, reasonable assurance that information selected44 by the Company and identified with the symbol √ in the Management Report has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.
However, it is not our responsibility to express an opinion on:
• the Company’s compliance with any other applicable legal and regulatory provisions, relating, in particular, to the duty of care requirement;
• the compliance of products and services with applicable regulatory provisions.
Nature and scope of our work
We performed our work described below in compliance with Article A.225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), defining the conditions under which the independent third party performs its engagement, and with the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes or CNCC)

We gained an understanding of the activity of all companies in the consolidation scope of the exposure to the main social and environmental risks relating to the business activity and, if applicable, , including any related policies and their outcomes;
We assessed the appropriateness of the Guidelines in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and clarity, by taking into consideration, where relevant, the sector’s best practices;
We verified that the Statement covers every category of information required under Article L.225-102-1, Paragraph III concerning social and environmental;
We verified that the Statement presents the business model and the main risks relating to the activity of all companies in the consolidation scope, including – if relevant and proportionate – risks due to its business relationships, products or services, in accordance with the disclosures required under Article R. 225-105-I, and policies, due diligence procedures and outcomes, including key performance indicators;
We verified that the Statement presents the disclosures required under article R. 225-105-II if they are relevant given the main risks or policies presented;
We obtained an understanding of the process for identifying, prioritizing and validating the main risks;
We enquired about the existence of internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the Company;
We verified that the Statement covers all companies in the consolidation scope in accordance with Article L. 233-16 [where applicable: within the limits specified in the Statement;
We assessed the data collection process implemented by the Company to ensure the completeness and fair presentation of the policy outcomes and key performance indicators that must be mentioned in the Statement;

comptes or CNCC) relating to this engagement and with ISAE 3000 (International standard on assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information). We conducted work to form an opinion on the Statement’s compliance with legal and regulatory provisions and the fair presentation of the Information therein:
Opinion
Based on our work, and given the scope of our responsibilities, we have no material misstatements to report that would call into question the Statement’s compliance with the applicable regulatory provisions, or the fair presentation of the information, taken as a whole, in accordance with the Guidelines.
Comment
Without qualifying our opinion, in accordance with article A. 225-3 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we draw your attention to the following matters:
The reporting scope and comparability of training indicators present significant limits, as mentioned in the Statement.
2. Reasonable assurance on a selection of CSR information.
Nature and scope of our work
With regard to the information selected by the Company and identified with the symbol √, we conducted the same procedures as those described in the paragraph “Nature and scope of our work” (for the most important Information). However, these procedures were more in- depth, particularly regarding the number of tests.
Consequently, the selected sample represents 100% of environmental information.
We believe that these procedures enable us to express reasonable assurance regarding the information selected by the Company and identified with the symbol √.
Conclusion
In our opinion, the information selected by the Company and identified with the symbol √ has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.
For key performance indicators and the other quantitative outcomes that we considered the most important, we set up:
> analytical procedures to verify that data collected are correctly consolidated and that any changes to the data are consistent;
> tests of details based on sampling to verify that definitions and procedures are correctly applied and to reconcile data with supporting documents. The work was carried out with a selection of entities contributing to the reported data and represents between 24% and 100% of consolidated data of key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these tests;
Georges Maregiano Partner
  We referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the due diligence procedures that we deemed the most important (organization, policies, actions, qualitative outcomes);
We assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our understanding of the Company.
We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have used, based on our professional judgment, are sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance opinion. A higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the Statement cannot be totally eliminated.
Means and resources
Our work drew on the skills of six individuals
To assist us in conducting our work, we called on our firm’s sustainable development and corporate social responsibility specialists. We conducted around twenty interviews with the individuals responsible for preparing the Statement.
45 Social indicators: Total headcount at 31/12 split by age, gender and geographic area; Number of recruitments; Number of leavings; Number of training hours.
Safety indicators: Frequency rate of lost-time accidents for Terminals and Crewing workforce; Severity rate of accidents for Crewing workforce.
Environmental indicators: Fuel consumption of the maritime fleet; Number of accidental discharges to the sea; Number of containers lost at sea; Production of sludge from unburnt fuel.

Quality leadership guides us on a path to
­success. We have formalised this aspiration
once again in our Strategy 2023. We focus
on permanently providing the best service
possible. This keeps us moving and ensures that we can ­r­eact quickly to all kinds
of change.
We continued on this path in 2019 – in the
interest of our stakeholders, and especially
for the benefit of our customers.

ON COURSE TOWARDS COMPETENCIES
The working world is becoming more complex. The ­level of digitalisation is increasing, and with it the amount of ­technology in our working environment. This means
our ­employees’ tasks and skill sets are also changing.
We take an adaptive approach towards further education, imparting specialist
knowledge – of occupational health and safety or compliance, for example –
­through innovative teaching methods. This keeps our employees up-to-date. At the
same time, they have every possible opportunity to progress both personally and
professionally – which is entirely in our company’s interest.

ON COURSE TOWARDS THE ENVIRONMENT
Social pressure on environmental issues is intensifying. It shows: The days of purely profit-oriented management are over. Today, we are also measured against other
standards. One of the expectations we have of ourselves is to further minimise the
environmental impact of our actions.
To achieve this, we combine the proven with the new. Global quality and environmental management standards form the basis of our activities. Through cooperative
research and development projects and our involvement in initiatives, we make a significant contribution to promoting global environmental standards in liner shipping.

ON COURSE TOWARDS DIGITALISATION
The digital transformation is proceeding rapidly. Technological innovations make it
possible to link processes and systems along the value chain more effectively than
ever before. This offers us the opportunity to equip ourselves for the future, which
will also benefit our customers and the environment.
The people who actively shape the digital transformation and implement it in the
company play an important role. We provide them with the trust and the space they
need to carry out their tasks.

As globalisation progresses and the speed of business processes grows, so do the
demands of our customers in regard to the quality of our work. In this environment,
we ensure the satisfaction of our customers by providing quick and reliable transport handling, meticulous documentation and personal contact.
In order to meet these high customer demands, we further developed our internal
processes and digital infrastructure in 2019. This allowed us to increase the level
of transparency for our customers and to improve our service. In the course of this,
we ensure the highest safety standards at all times – on land and at sea. Also in
other areas, digital solutions help us to unlock new efficiency and user potential
that will benefit our customers.

ON COURSE TOWARDS COOPERATION
The consolidation process in the industry currently appears to be largely complete.
To remain competitive in these times, one must be flexible and capable of efficiently
utilising available resources. Cooperation can help make this possible. We maintain a diverse range of partnerships which enable us to offer our customers further
added value. However, our main focus is using collaborative relationships to ensure
the best possible outcomes for the environment and society.

FOREWORD OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

ON COURSE TOWARDS THE FUTURE

“

We want to be
the number one
for quality.”
ROLF HABBEN JANSEN,
CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dear Friends of Hapag-Lloyd,
Without container shipping, there would be no global trade. Roughly 90 percent of all internationally traded goods are transported by sea. At the same time, society’s demands on us as a
shipping company are growing – especially when it comes to sustainability. Our stakeholders
want to know: How is Hapag-Lloyd contributing to protecting the climate and the environment? How are we conserving resources? And how committed is the company to ensuring
that human rights are respected along the supply chain?
Our answer to these questions is an approach that reconciles our four dimensions of sustainability – the environment, the economy, quality and social issues. But what does that mean in
concrete terms for our sustainability-related activities? As a liner shipping company, we can
exert the greatest leverage for effective climate-protection measures in how we operate our
fleet. One of our most important goals is to reduce our emissions. We intend to achieve this in
several ways, including by boosting energy efficiency in the operation of our current and future
vessels as well as by reducing bunker consumption. And our measures are making a genuine
impact: Compared to the reference year 2008, we have succeeded in reducing our specific
CO2 emissions – meaning CO2 emissions per TEU-kilometre – by 50 percent.

In addition, we are contributing to improving air quality. Regarding this issue, the International
Maritime Organization (IMO) issued new specifications on the maximum sulphur content of
marine fuels, which have been in force since 1 January 2020. As a result, preparing for the
so-called IMO 2020 regulations was one of the main focuses of the 2019 reporting year. We got
started with our planning early and made the necessary conversions to our fleet. Since the beginning of the year, we have been using low-sulphur fuels, which emit more than 70 percent less
sulphur oxides than the fuel previously in use.
We are also actively committed to protecting the oceans, and we are a signatory to the Arctic
Shipping Corporate Pledge of the US sporting goods manufacturer Nike and the environmental
advocacy group Ocean Conservancy. Participating companies pledge to refrain from using shipping routes through the Arctic in order to protect the unique ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean.
Respecting human rights and treating our environment with care are givens for us. Hapag-Lloyd
is accordingly in favour of a binding supply chain law to regulate human rights and environmental
due diligence obligations. In a related matter, we support a corresponding declaration by the
Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, which aims to pave the way for a German as well as
a common European solution and thereby create uniform market conditions.
The issue of sustainability also encompasses the economic success of Hapag-Lloyd. In the
reporting year behind us, we enjoyed positive business developments. Furthermore, we have
implemented additional elements of our Strategy 2023 in order to differentiate ourselves in
the market and to become the number one for quality among carriers. For example, we have
adjusted our organisational structures and created a new Region South Europe. We have
invested in the digitalisation of our products and services. And we have established more Quality Service Centers in order to be able to offer our custo­mers even better and quicker service.
As you can see, during the 2019 reporting year, we advanced one step further in all dimensions of sustainability. But one thing is also clear: Far-reaching changes do not happen overnight. Especially in an asset-intensive industry such as container shipping, investment decisions must be carefully weighed. A ship that we order today must meet all the environmental
requirements not only of tomorrow, but also of the next few decades, and it must be able to
operate in a way that covers its costs.
Thus, we will “Stay on Course”. We have our sights firmly set on our sustainability projects and
our corporate goals, and we intend to achieve them safely – together with our approximately
13,000 employees, customers and shareholders. After all, this is the only way that we can fulfil
our social responsibility and thereby ensure the success of our company – both today and in
the future.
We hope you enjoy reading our sustainability report.
Hamburg, 19 March 2020
Sincerely,

Rolf Habben Jansen
(Chairman of the Executive Board)

This is the third sustainability report (SR) issued by the
Hapag-Lloyd Group and Hapag-Lloyd AG. It contains the
combined separate non-financial report (NfR). In line with
the requirements of the German CSR Guideline Implementation Act (CSR-RUG), the statements complete the
financial reporting of Hapag-Lloyd with disclosures on significant non-financial aspects in accordance with Sections
315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e of the German
Commercial Code (HGB). — NfR
The sustainability report provides extensive information about the Group’s sustainability activities and goes
beyond the legal requirements. All disclosures which are
part of the NfR and serve to ensure compliance with CSRRUG are marked “NfR”. — NfR

Unless otherwise indicated, all disclosures in this report
relate to the entire group of consolidated companies.
The group of consolidated companies, which comprises
the Hapag-Lloyd AG companies and affiliated consolidated companies, is listed in the 2019 Annual Report,
p. 168 et seq. — NfR
The group of consolidated companies also comprises the
companies of UASC Ltd. (United Arab Shipping Company). They were included in the consolidated financial
statements of Hapag-Lloyd AG at the time of the transfer
of control on 24 May 2017. As a result, the financial indicators for 2017 presented in the NfR can only be compared to the 2016 and 2018 figures to a limited extent.

The scope of disclosures regarding the ships deployed is
indicated by the following phrasing.
–	If the disclosure pertains to the entire fleet including
charter ships, the phrases “all ships” or “the entire fleet”
are used.
–	If the disclosure pertains to all of our own ships from all
Fleet Management organisations, we say “our ships” or
“our fleet”.
–	In some cases, the disclosure only pertains to our ships
registered under the German flag. In such cases, we
speak of “ships registered under the German flag” or
“ships under the German flag”. — NfR
Disclosures relating to marine personnel refer to our own
staff. — NfR
References to disclosures outside the Group management
report constitute additional information and are not part of
the NfR. — NfR
The social requirements under CSR-RUG are of major
importance to Hapag-Lloyd but do not fulfil the materiality
criteria of CSR-RUG. — NfR

The content of the NfR was subjected to a voluntary
operational audit in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised)
with limited assurance by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft. The audit assignment
and result can be found in the Independent practitioner’s
report on a limited assurance engagement on non-financial reporting at the end of this SR. — NfR
The NfR is based on the internationally recognised Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI Standards). We based our reporting on GRI
Standard 103 as regards the presentation of concepts for
the NfR-related aspects. Non-financial indicators based
on the relevant GRI Standards have also been reported
for these aspects wherever such standards exist. Some
of the content of the report is marked for the NfR as well
as for the GRI Standards. This content was not checked
against the requirements of the GRI Standards. — NfR
This report (SR) has been prepared in accordance with the
GRI Standards Core option.
The information was requested electronically and the data
were predominantly recorded using area-specific software.
When adding up and transferring data, rounding differences may occur. All forward-looking statements in the
NfR are based on the assumptions valid at copy deadline.
Due to unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors,
the actual results, developments or performance of the
company may differ from our forecasts, assessments and
announcements (see Management Report, p. 50 et seq.).

The formulation of topics has changed slightly compared with the previous year. New topics have also
been declared relevant under CSR-RUG. The reason for
this is the materiality analysis conducted in 2019 (see
­Hapag-Lloyd, p. 05 et seq.). — NfR

— NfR

An essential connection relevant for understanding the
amounts in the consolidated financial statements was not
established. — NfR

To ensure legibility, we do not use gender-specific double
pronouns in the NfR. This is not intended as indicative. All
pronouns should be regarded as gender-neutral. — NfR

The topic of supply chain refers to all aspects which have
been identified as being subject to mandatory reporting;
the topic itself, however, does not require reporting. It is
covered in a separate chapter. — NfR

This report frequently refers to the industry-specific
­twenty-foot equivalent unit (abbreviated TEU), which is
an international standard unit for shipping containers.

The NfR is published every year in English and German on
the Hapag-Lloyd website. In it, Hapag-Lloyd reports on
the progress made in the financial year under review, from
1 January to 31 December. This NfR concerns the 2019
financial year. — NfR

The statements on the group of consolidated companies
and on the reporting period as well as on the gathering of
information and on legibility also apply to the SR.
You can find further information at Hapag-Lloyd.com/en
and in the annual report. The next sustainability report is
scheduled for publication in April 2021.

Our profile
Hapag-Lloyd is one of the world’s leading container ­liner
shipping companies and a high-performance partner.
With our Strategy 2023, we want to differentiate ourselves through our exceptional quality and customer
orientation, and further strengthen our position on
the market. To do this, we will draw on our many years
of experience, broad service network, digital solutions
and agile working methods. — NfR
OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP
Hapag-Lloyd’s core area of business primarily concerns
the shipping of containers by sea. We also offer door-todoor transport services around the world, and support
our customers with pre-carriage and on-carriage by inland
waterway, rail and road. With these services, our global
market coverage, transported container volume and
transport capacities, Hapag-Lloyd has positioned itself as

one of the world’s leading container liner shipping companies. We ensure our high quality standards with long-term
partnerships and proven suppliers. — NfR — 102-2
Since the company was founded in 1847, the H
­ apag-Lloyd
headquarters have been located in Hamburg. Today,
around 13,000 employees (Hapag-Lloyd AG: around
3,500) work for us in 59 countries. We have 239 modern
container ships (previous year: 227) and ship an annual

transport volume of around 12 million TEU1. Globally, we
operate 121 liner services, which enable us to offer fast
and secure connections. — NfR ­— 102-3, 102-7
Since 2019, we have conducted operations in six regions
– Asia, Middle East, North Europe, South Europe, North
America and Latin America. The Mediterranean region
gained significance for us as a result of our merger with
the United Arab Shipping Company (UASC) in 2017,
so that we divided our former Region Europe into the
Regions North Europe and South Europe. By doing this,
we hope to strengthen our competitive position in this
attractive growth market and take advantage of new
opportunities. We will also be able to increase our quality,
efficiency and profitability through more proximity to the
customer. — 102-4, 102-6, 102-10
Each of the six regions has its own regional headquarters.
These are in Hamburg (Germany), Genoa (Italy), Piscataway (USA), Valparaiso (Chile), Singapore and Dubai
(United Arab Emirates). The organisational structures of
the regions are based on a highly efficient principle that
is identical worldwide: each regional headquarters has
its own Business Administration, Operations and Sales
as well as Customer Service departments. — 102-4, 102-6,
102-10

The regions are in turn divided into areas which also
cover the functions mentioned above. Due to restructuring activities in the Europe, Middle East and Asia regions,
we have reduced the number of areas from 35 to 32.
— 102-4, 102-6, 102-10

and the composition of the Supervisory Board, as well
as Hapag-Lloyd’s diversity concept, in our latest annual
report (see 2019 Annual Report, pp. 28 et seq., 30 et seq.
and 54 et seq.). — 102-5, 102-18, 405/103
Improved customer service through Quality Service
Centers — 102-10
Quality is a key cornerstone of our Strategy 2023. Therefore we are creating more Quality Service Centers (QSC),
which will improve our organisational structure and future
processes. The QSCs centralise the selected functions
Customer Service, Operations and Business Administration at a site. This enables us to bundle expertise and
create additional synergies such as improved consistency
and service quality. It also simplifies ongoing improvements in processes. Due to the size of the units, we are
able to significantly improve our training, representation
and coverage of spikes in workload, thus ultimately providing our customers with better service.
Our long-term goal is to establish a QSC in every region.
In October 2019, for example, we opened a new QSC in
Area Brazil and relocated the Customer Service, Operations and Business Administration departments of five
cities to the Santos site. In the process, we also created
new jobs there.
We now have QSCs in Suzhou (China), Atlanta (USA),
Mumbai (India) and Santos (Brazil). In 2020, four additional
QSCs will probably go into operation in the Asia, Latin
America and Middle East regions.

Our services — 102-2, 102-4, 102-6, 102-7
Around the world, our 392 sales offices (2018: 407) and
sales partners as well as our headquarters managed
transports for around 30,600 customers in the 2019 financial year (2018: around 30,200). — NfR
We ship goods from eleven product categories, from food
to engineering products. The transport volume is divided
roughly evenly between the categories: the smallest product category accounts for 5%, the largest for 16% of the
transport volume (see 2019 Annual Report, p. 71 et seq.).
This makes our business relatively unaffected by economic
cycles within individual industries, allowing us to maintain
steady growth under normal economic conditions. — NfR
In principle we transport all authorised goods; however,
we exclude the transport of controversial goods which we
have defined in an exclusion list (see Environmental and
water protection, p. 77 et seq. and Dangerous goods,
p. 57 et seq.).
We do not currently call in Iran or Cuba for geopolitical
reasons.
Group-wide Strategy 2023
In late 2018, we created guidelines for Strategy 2023,
which will support our long-term, profitable and organic
growth in the coming years. Key cornerstones of Strategy
2023 are securing Hapag-Lloyd’s position as a global
player and establishing our company as the quality leader
in the industry. — NfR

We measure the success of our initiatives on the basis
of developments in the transport volume and the key
performance indicators of EBITDA and EBIT, as well as
by non-financial indicators such as a Net Promoter Score
(NPS), which provides us with information about customer
loyalty. — NfR
In the course of implementing our strategy and to promote
customer satisfaction, in 2019 we carried out two customer surveys and took measures to optimise the entire
door-to-door transport route. The goal is to improve the
punctuality of our deliveries and to project arrival times
more precisely. In future, we want to use digital solutions
to standardise the recording and measurement of our
punctuality (see Customer focus, p. 89 et seq. and Digitalisation, p. 60 et seq.). — NfR
In addition, we want to increase our profitability – another
key aspect of Strategy 2023 – across the entire transport
route. We will accomplish this by increasing the proportion
of door-to-door business in conjunction with our partners
by 2023 for example (see Digitalisation, p. 60 et seq. and
Sustainable procurement, p. 82 et seq.). — NfR
We will rely on systematic digitalisation, increased automation and agility to achieve these targets. By using new
digital technologies and agile methods, we will achieve
continual optimisation of our internal processes and
systems (see Digitalisation, p. 60 et seq. and Customer
focus, p. 89 et seq.). — NfR

O U R P R O F I L E | H A PA G - L L O Y D

We have also included environmental awareness in the
new Group strategy. Our high internal environmental
standards will contribute to our differentiation in the market over the long term. It is a matter of course for us to
comply with all environmental requirements and to implement the necessary technical and organisational changes
with the greatest care and attention (see Climate protection and reduction of emissions, p. 69 et seq.). — NfR
For a more detailed presentation of the Group strategy,
please see the 2019 Annual Report, p. 56 et seq.
Strong partner in THE Alliance — 102-7, 102-13
Hapag-Lloyd is a founding member of THE Alliance.
Together with our partners in Asia, we link 75 ports (2018:
74) worldwide with a fleet of 251 ships (2018: 246) covering 29 major east-west routes (2018: 30). Our customers
also benefit from our extensive port coverage, efficient
fleet and fast transit times. Regular communication within
the alliance ensures optimal, flexible ship deployment
in the network. As of 1 April 2020, the Korean shipping
company HMM (Hyundai Merchant Marine) will join THE
Alliance; the collaboration will continue until 2030.

09

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT — 201-1
In 2019, we recorded an increase in the fleet from
227 ships (2018) to 239, and a corresponding increase
in transport capacity from 1.64 million TEU (2018) to
around 1.71 ­million TEU. Our container capacity amounted
to around 2.54 million TEU in the reporting year (2018:
around 2.56 million TEU). Our transport volume increased
from 11,874 TTEU the previous year to 12,037 TTEU,
partly due to new services in Africa and India.
Our revenue increased by around 9% to EUR 12,608 million (2018: EUR 11,618 million), while EBITDA for the financial year reached EUR 1,986 million (2018: EUR 1,139 million). Our operating result (EBIT) of EUR 811 m
­ illion in 2019
was higher than in the previous year (2018: EUR 444 million)2. The freight rate was 1,072 USD/TEU in the 2019
financial year and thus above the previous year’s level of
1,044 USD/TEU (2018).
For more information, please refer to the 2019 Annual
Report, p. 81 et seq.

2	Due to the change in presentation of the consolidated income statement, the
previous year's figures have been adjusted. As a result, EBIT in 2018 increased by EUR 0.5 million from EUR 443.0 million to EUR 443.5 million. EBITDA
in 2018 also increased by EUR 0.5 million from EUR 1,138.1 million to EUR
1,138.6 million. Revenues in 2018 were adjusted by EUR 102.4 million from
EUR 11,515.1 million to EUR 11,617.5 million.

INTERVIEW WITH
ULF SCHAWOHL

Quality through
cooperation:
Achieving more
together
So far, collaboration with our partners has been positive in
every respect. Of course, there have also been occasional
challenges which have arisen in the course of day-today operations, usually driven by divergent commercial
interests, but at the end of the day, we always manage
to work together to find a solution. These challenges are
especially great during the early stages of a new alliance.
Each shipping company has different areas of focus,
which are pooled together to form a complete product.
For our customers, this is reflected especially in the
expansion of the service network and thus in the flexibility
of ship deployments and the reliability of scheduling.
Ulf Schawohl has worked for Hapag-Lloyd in a number of different
roles since 1980. In 2011, he took over as head of the Network &
Cooperations Department, before being appointed manager of the
central Network Department in 2014. Network & Cooperations focu­
ses on the global deployment and coordination of Hapag-Lloyd ships
and charter ships in order to manage bottlenecks and high cargo
volumes. This department is also responsible for joint services and
alliances with other shipping companies.

THE Alliance was founded by Hapag-Lloyd,
the three Japanese shipping companies NYK,
MOL and “K” Line, and the Taiwanese shipping company Yang Ming. This collaborative
relationship began on 1 April 2017. What has
your experience of collaboration within the
alliance been like over the past few years? Did
the start of the collaborative relationship bring
with it any challenges? Does THE Alliance
offer any particular benefits for customers?

When one looks back to 2017, which was an
eventful year, it is interesting to note that this
was the year in which the merger of the three
aforementioned Japanese shipping companies was agreed, resulting in the establishment of ONE. That same year, Hapag-Lloyd
merged with UASC. Do you believe that the
major consolidation phase within container
shipping is now over? What are your reasons
for this?
I think that for the time being, there will not be any further
consolidation within the sector among the largest shipping companies, as a merger between these companies
would not yield increased benefits proportional to the
new company size. For us specifically, this means that we
are choosing to focus on quality aspects. Our strategy
for 2023, which is centred around the customer, includes continuous and efficient improvement of scheduling,

11

ensuring that we will continue to be able to offer competitive products in future.
THE Alliance is set to be strengthened further
in future with the addition of another important partner, the South Korean shipping company Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM). What
do you think the positive effects of having a
new member will be for THE Alliance and thus
Hapag-Lloyd?
For one, this will expand our service network. The main
benefit is most certainly that over the next two years, HMM
will bring new ships in the 23,000 TEU and 15,000 TEU size
segments to the alliance. As these newly built vessels are
state of the art, Hapag-Lloyd will be improving its ecological
footprint for containers transported on these ships.

Top image:
In the interest of the customers, all those
involved in the alliance are pulling in the
same direction.
Bottom image:
Cooperation will enable our partners to
transport even more containers worldwide.

Sustainability
management
Responsible corporate governance is a part of our identity.
We want to work in such a way that the opportunities
and outlook for future generations are not jeopardised.
To guarantee this, we have introduced relevant ­s tructures
and processes and actively promote the sustainable
thinking and behaviour of our staff using a wide range of
measures. — NfR

SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES
As a traditional Hanseatic company, value-based, responsible actions are firmly anchored in our corporate culture.
Our sustainability policy defines our concept of sustainability in the form of binding guidelines and principles. In
them, we commit to protecting the environment, to providing our customers with the highest quality, to securing
satisfactory returns for our owners and to ensuring the
health and safety of our employees. They supplement the
content of the Global Code of Ethics, in which we have
formalised our aspiration to comply with all laws and internal codes of conduct, without exception.
Hapag-Lloyd’s management continually develops the
company’s strategic direction with an eye towards raising
awareness and fulfilling our quality and environmental
objectives. We are engaged in ongoing, open dialogue
with our various stakeholders. This helps us to continuously improve our quality, environmental and safety standards (see Hapag-Lloyd, p. 05 et seq.).
Our employees around the world are the cornerstone
of our company’s success. As an employer, we want to
encourage their long-term loyalty. We therefore invest in
their training and further education and offer additional
attractive benefits (see Employees, p. 29 et seq.) as well
as a safe and healthy working environment (see Health
and safety, p. 47 et seq.). In the interest of a healthy
employee structure, we have our HR conditions and processes checked via internal and external audits.

We make targeted investments in the digitalisation and
automation of our work in order to constantly improve the
quality of our service. The Digital Business and Transformation (DB&T) department plays a major role in shaping
the digital transformation of our company, supporting the
optimisation of our processes throughout the Group (see
Digitalisation and digital security, p. 59 et seq.).
Our aim is to keep our impact on the environment and
climate as low as possible. We have implemented high
environmental standards for this purpose and use cutting-edge technology as one method of ensuring compliance with them. Our activities focus on reducing our
energy consumption and the CO2 emissions of our fleet.
We review the efficacy of our measures through internal
and external audits (see Environmental and climate protection, p. 67 et seq.). We also implement various preventive measures in order to protect people, the environment,
cargo, and property, plant and equipment. These include
audits according to ISO standards, the implementation of
the safety management system on all our ships and the
inclusion of environmental protection in the emergency
manual. — 102-11
The high standards that we set ourselves also apply to our
suppliers and subcontractors. Together with our business partners, we continually seek solutions for improved
sustainability in our transport chain (see Supply chain and
customer focus, p. 81 et seq.).
With our social involvement, we actively contribute to society in many different ways above and beyond our direct

13

business activities (see Corporate social responsibility, ­
p. 91 et seq.).
Certified quality and environmental management
— 302/103, 305/103, 306/103

One major aspect of our sustainability management
strategy is our quality and environmental management
(QEM) system, which is certified in accordance with ISO
9001 (quality management) and ISO 14001 (environmental
management). Certified sites in the regions and our headquarters are audited annually by DNV GL with regard to
requirements. — NfR
Components of the ISO 9001 audit include occupational
safety, employee training, customer focus and evaluation
of service providers. The ISO 14001 audit includes topics
such as the efficient utilisation of resources and reduction
of negative environmental influences. The existing certification confirms our compliance with requirements. Nonetheless, we use the audit results in line with their objective
in order to continually improve our processes. — NfR
In 2019, around 160 (Hapag-Lloyd AG: around 90) internal
and external audits were conducted worldwide. Because

new areas and one region formed in 2019 since the last
monitoring audit, they have not yet been included in the
QEM certificate. In general, we integrate new regions,
areas, locations and ships into the QEM system in a timely
manner. Shore-based staff are trained in QEM via mandatory Web-based training sessions, ensuring that they too
meet our high standards of quality and environment. — NfR
There are more than 130 QEM delegates active worldwide in the regions, areas and/or central departments,
as well as on ships (Hapag-Lloyd AG: more than 60).
They support the operational sustainability work of Sustainability Management by coordinating QEM and other
sustainability activities and ensuring that the QEM system
is implemented at the global sites. They participate in
annual QEM meetings in which Sustainability Management reports on the progress of external audits and any
deviations, as well as on our reporting in the context of
the sustainability report. — NfR

14

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 9

The fleet management for our 41 ships registered under
the German flag has carried the “DNV GL Excellence
– 5 Stars” certification for 12 years. Certification unites
the requirements of several standards to go above and
beyond these recognised standards and regulations:
implementation of workplace safety measures in accordance with MLC 2006, and certifications in accordance
with ISO 9001, ISO 14001, the International Safety
Manage­ment (ISM) Code and the International Ship and
Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code on the prevention of maritime security risks. Hapag-Lloyd was the first container
liner shipping company to be awarded this standard. — NfR
Continued development of sustainability
management
As in previous years, we made gratifying progress with
our sustainability management in 2019. For example, we
developed our sustainability reporting and communication,
worked on CO2 calculations and intensified the management of our QEM system. We will also aim at continued
development of sustainability management in the future.
At the core of our efforts is the implementation of our
measures in line with Strategy 2023.

Another focus is the expansion of our contribution towards
protecting people and the environment. For this reason, in
2018 and 2019, Sustainability Management dealt extensively with the United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) and linked them with our business activities.
We communicated the results to all staff on the intranet
and asked them to take part in the global survey on sustainability and the SDGs of our partner, Hamburg-based
sustainability consultants Schlange & Co.
We analysed in detail how competitors and companies
from other industries contribute to achieving the SDGs.
Subsequently, we compared the existing activities, measures and initiatives from a number of our different areas
with the content of the SDGs. We wanted to know which
positive contribution Hapag-Lloyd makes towards the
17 SDGs and their 169 subgoals. Hapag-Lloyd already
contributes to the following United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals:

WE SUPPORT THE SDGS

ORGANISATION OF SUSTAINABILITY
MANAGEMENT — 102-18
Sustainability management at Hapag-Lloyd is the responsibility of the Sustainability Management department,
which is part of Corporate Development and reports
directly to the Executive Board. It coordinates and supports all our sustainability activities including environmental management of land-based operations as part of our
Group-wide QEM system, as well as ISO 9001 and 14001
certifications on land. Environmental management of seabased operations is the responsibility of Fleet Manage­
ment and the Environmental Management department.
— NfR

Sustainability Management is also in charge of preparing the Group’s sustainability report, answers questions
on sustainability-related topics, and coordinates working
groups on topics related to sustainability. — NfR
Sustainability Management informs the Sustainability
Committee – which comprises divisional managers and
regional representatives – about ongoing sustainability
activities. It assists with efforts to identify sustainability
opportunities and risks, promotes the sharing of information across divisions and is involved in coordinating
sustainability-related measures. The Head of Corporate
Development chairs the meetings of the Sustainability
Committee and reports directly to the Executive Committee, which the Executive Board is part of. — NfR

Material
topics
and risks
As a global service provider, our business and day-today decisions are heavily influenced by developments in
society, the environment and the global economy. Our
stakeholders communicate their concerns to us in a
­v ariety of ways. We carefully analyse which topics and
associated risks are of particular significance for our
­c orporate governance and focus our work on them. — NfR

We carried out a materiality analysis again in 2019,
which enabled us to update the results from 2016 (see
Material topics, p. 16 et seq.). We also carried out a net
risk ­analysis as part of our Group-wide risk management system in order to identify relevant risks3 (see Risk
­management, p. 18). — NfR

MATERIAL TOPICS — 102-43, 102-46
In late 2019, we carried out a materiality analysis in order
to obtain a current overview of the most relevant sustainability-related topics for our company and our stakeholders.
To do this, we first compared existing material topics with
the competition and discussed them with the involvement
of an external consultancy. In doing so, we revised the
distinctions between the topics and took up new ones.
The list comprised a total of 23 potentially material topics
from the areas of social commitment, the environment and
economy. — NfR

3	Risks are deemed to be relevant if they are associated with Hapag-Lloyd’s
business activities, business relationships, products or services; they are
deemed very likely to occur; and they have serious negative effects on
aspects such as the environment or social involvement, for example. Other
topics that are relevant for the risk analysis include employee matters, observance of human rights and efforts to combat corruption and bribery.

Hapag-Lloyd wants to
contribute fairly to society
and is involved in numerous associations, working
groups and institutions.
For example, we are an
active member of Clean
Cargo and the Ship
Recycling Transparency
Initiative.

We then carried out an anonymous online stakeholder
survey on which international external and internal stakeholders could evaluate the relevance of the topics to
Hapag-Lloyd’s business activities. They were also asked
about their perception of Hapag-Lloyd’s potential for
improvement. External stakeholders include suppliers,
customers, shareholders, the media, and representatives
from the general population, science and politics. Internal
stakeholders include employees, senior staff, and members of the Works Council, trade unions, and the Supervisory Board. Over 230 external and internal stakeholders
took part in the survey. — NfR
The results of the survey were then transferred to a materiality matrix. In this Sustainability Report (SR), we report in
particular on the topics identified as material. — NfR

The material topics under CSR-RUG were identified by
Sustainability Management on the basis of this information. In the process, criteria were taken into account which
dealt with the impact of business activities on the non-­
financial matters, and their relevance to H
­ apag-Lloyd’s
business activities. The identified topics were categorized
according to the following relevant aspects: e
­ nvironment,
employees, combating corruption and bribery and
obser­vance of human rights. These are included in
­Hapag-Lloyd’s ­non-financial report (NfR) (see Index on
the non-financial report, p. 03).4 — NfR
The topics “Business strategy considering both sustainability opportunities and risks” and “Service/process quality” are each addressed directly within the NfR sections
when relevant. The social matters under CSR-RUG are
of major importance to Hapag-Lloyd but do not fulfil the
materiality criteria of CSR-RUG. Beyond the NfR itself,
this SR also reports on other topics that are important
to us but do not meet the materiality criteria of the CSRRUG, such as our diverse activities in the social arena (see
Social, p. 91 et seq.). — NfR

RISK MANAGEMENT
Awareness of sustainable approaches and actions with
regard to quality, the environment and occupational safety
is a fixed component of our corporate policy and thus
also our risk management. The prerequisite for our lasting
success is the integrity of our corporate and risk strategy,
which ensures early identification and proactive management of the risks and opportunities that result from our
business operations. — NfR
Risks to the Company’s existence will be handled responsibly by means of a Group-wide Hapag-Lloyd risk management system, which represents the procedure for the
identification, analysis, management and control of our
corporate risks. — NfR

4	Sections containing topics which require reporting under CSR-RUG
are marked NfR.

The risk management system
In order to effectively manage increasingly complex financial and non-financial risks, and to further increase the
value of the Company, Hapag-Lloyd uses its risk management system as an important tool for corporate governance. — NfR
The risk management system has a multi-level structure.
The identification of material risks is the responsibility of
the divisions or regions, who communicate these within
the organisation. The relevant Risk Manager consolidates
the risk information and continually monitors it or initiates
risk mitigation measures. The risk managers in the regions
and specialist departments are experts in their respective
areas, and their awareness goes beyond the operational
and financial impacts of risks to include social and ecological aspects such as compliant fuel, ship recycling and
training and further education. — NfR
The material risks and analysis of the risk portfolio are
compiled by the Group risk management system. This
serves the Risk Committee as the basis for monitoring the
overall risk situation. The Risk Committee reports quarterly
– or on an ad-hoc basis where required – to the Executive
Board, which is responsible for safeguarding the efficacy
of the risk management system. The Audit Committee
monitors risk management at the highest level and reports
to the Supervisory Board. — NfR
Systematic recording and evaluation
of non-financial risks
During the reporting period, Sustainability Management
honed the process for systematically recording and
evaluating non-financial risks. Since December 2018, all
areas and central departments covered by the QEM ISO
certificate have been required to list relevant non-financial
risks or risks from the areas of quality, the environment,
social commitment, human rights, employees and corruption that exceed USD 100,000 net in a register for QEM
risks. Methods and opportunities are also documented.
The register is evaluated at least every three months for
its accuracy and the effectiveness of the individual measures. In the process, an ongoing dialogue is maintained
with Central Risk Management in order to avoid parallel
or divergent processes becoming established, and also to
create synergies. — NfR

In the course of the first quarter of 2020, preventive
measures were taken and corresponding actions in connection with COVID-19 implemented. Due to the uncertainty regarding the containment of the viral disease, the
corresponding effects of COVID-19 have not yet been
conclusively assessable. In this year’s risk assessment, no
risks subject to a reporting obligation were identified which
were associated with our own business activities, business relationships, products or services or were deemed
very likely to have serious negative effects on the non-­
financial matters, either now or in the future. The consideration of COVID-19 did not change this assessment. — NfR

STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE
— 102-40, 102-42, 102-43, 102-44

Hapag-Lloyd sees itself as a transparent company. As
such, we maintain an active dialogue with our various
stakeholders and include findings in our corporate governance. We use various formats to regularly communicate
with them so we can discover their expectations and perceptions and hear their comments and ideas, then identify

CPO

CFO

areas for improvement and translate them into actions.
An important aspect of this is our sustainability reporting,
which we use to lay out a comprehensive view of our sustainability performance that goes beyond the legal requirements. When critical issues are addressed, we always
communicate them in a clear and comprehensible way.
In 2019, Hapag-Lloyd was voted as having the best press
office in the German logistics industry by the “Wirtschaftsjournalist” business magazine.
Shareholder dialogue
As a listed company, it is our aim to provide transparent,
timely and in-depth information about our strategy and
perspectives on the company. The Executive Board and
Investor Relations (IR) team regularly inform shareholders,
analysts and potential investors about the development
and direction of the company, as well as current potential
risks, via the publication of annual and interim reports as
well as personal discussions at events or at the Annual
General Meeting. The IR area of our website also provides
extensive information.

We currently see an increasing demand for ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) topics on the part of
investors. We meet this demand with one-on-one conversations at conferences or by answering specific questions,
for example. In 2019, we also held separate conversations
with investors and analysts which referred only to ESG
topics. The key issues were air emissions and pollutants –
primarily CO2 and sulphur emissions – ballast water and
contaminant leaks, governance and, increasingly, cybersecurity.
Dialogue with our employees
We actively foster an open dialogue with our employees,
and it is our aim to reduce (perceived) hierarchies within
the company. In addition to the annual employee meetings
(Global Staff Dialogues), we do this in part using unusual
formats like the weekly Lunch with the Management,
breakfast with the Executive Board in Hamburg, and
regular meetings where staff present their activities to
their colleagues. By organising tours of container ships for
employees based in Hamburg, we also promote dialogue
between our marine and shore-based personnel.
We inform our staff around the world about key topics
and interesting activities on an ongoing basis via the
intranet, as well as through our quarterly employee magazine. The regular dialogue between the Executive Board

and the Works Council is another major form of internal
dialogue.
As part of a global employee survey, we integrated our
staff into the process to redefine our corporate values
during the reporting period. The topics of environmental
protection and sustainability were rated as very important
(see Corporate values, p. 44).
Dialogue with customers and
business partners
We engage in regular dialogue with our customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition to cargo and data
security, our customers are increasingly interested in topics related to sustainability – particularly our environmental
impact and CO2 emissions. The information requested
may extend from a calculation of our CO2 footprint to
answering questionnaires about emissions. We engage in
dialogue with our suppliers in the course of shared projects such as terminal partnering (see Sustainable procurement, p. 82 et seq.).
In 2019, we primarily exchanged information with our customers and business partners about IMO 2020 requirements and our implementation strategy. Two customer
surveys were carried out during the reporting period (see
Customer focus, p. 89 et seq.).

M AT E R I A L T O P I C S A N D R I S K S | H A PA G - L L O Y D

Dialogue with non-governmental
organisations
In communicating with non-governmental organisations
(NGOs), we aim to facilitate mutual understanding of
important and critical topics and to actively contribute our
expertise in order to work on solutions together. We do
this through personal discussions, participation in conferences and collaboration with committees. The topics
we focus on here include ship recycling, pollution emissions and the transportation of controversial goods (see
Environmental action, p. 93 et seq.). We work in partnership with the environmental organisations ­OceanCare
and WWF and conduct open discussions with NABU.
Hapag-Lloyd employees are also available to German
environmental organisations as speakers. Thanks to our
membership of the World Shipping Council, we are in dialogue with the International Foundation of Animal Welfare
in order to protect blue whales in Sri Lanka. Together with
the environmental organisation Ocean Conservancy, we
have also engaged in dialogue with the Nike sportswear
manufacturer and have signed the Ocean Conservancy’s
voluntary Arctic Shipping Corporate Pledge. This pledge
commits us to avoid the use of Arctic shipping routes (see
Environmental and water protection, p. 77 et seq.). During
the reporting period, we also entered into dialogue with
Hamburg-based representatives of the Fridays for Future
movement.
Dialogue with policymakers
Hapag-Lloyd is one of the world’s biggest container liner
shipping companies and Germany’s largest liner shipping
company. Our ongoing dialogue with politicians at the
European, state and municipal level is very important for
us because we want to bring our stringent Group-wide
environmental standards into the industry.
At the European Union (EU) level, we are actively involved
in the political decision-making process, for example with
the formation of sustainable environmental legislation. In
doing so, we want to ensure that our investments in more
efficient and environmentally friendly ships do not put
us at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we want
to prevent a situation whereby modernisations no longer
meet newer environmental requirements after just a short
period of time. In 2018, we entered a five-year membership in the European Commission’s European Sustainable

21

Shipping Forum (ESSF). The forum discusses the restriction of sulphur content and many other topics, in order to
minimise the environmental impacts of commercial shipping. During the reporting period, Hapag-Lloyd was active
in two working groups which collaborated on four submissions to the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
These submissions primarily related to the implementation
of the new IMO 2020 regulations for low-sulphur fuels. In
order to make our political involvement within the EU clear
and comprehensible, we are listed in the Transparency
Register of the European Commission.
At an international level, we have also discussed the
possibility of applying to set up an Emission Control Area
(ECA) with the Ministry of Transport of China.
At a state and municipal level, we conduct frequent discussions with the City of Hamburg, which is part owner
of Hapag-Lloyd and a central stakeholder. As part of our
accountability obligations, we regularly provide the city
with information about the Company’s economic performance and Hapag-Lloyd’s strategic objectives. In a
political context, we communicate our perspectives on
infrastructural matters, such as the expansion of the port,
the dredging of the Elbe and the modernisation of rail
infrastructure. For this purpose, we publish the political
newsletter “Hapag-Lloyd Inside” three times a year and
send it to around 3,000 recipients in politics as well as
various associations and chambers.
In December 2019, we once again organised a parliamentary evening for delegates from the Hamburg Parliament
and members of the German Bundestag from Hamburg.
During the course of the year, we also regularly seek out
dialogue with the various political parties. Our Chief Executive Officer, Rolf Habben Jansen, is also frequently invited
as a speaker to events in the field of politics or those held
by politically active associations.

Dialogue with the local community
Hapag-Lloyd is a traditional Hamburg company, which
is why maintaining a dialogue with our local citizens is
close to our hearts. Every year, for example, we open our
doors to interested Hamburg citizens as part of the Supply
Chain Day (Tag der Logistik) and the Heritage Day (Tag
des offenen Denkmals) and invite them to public cultural
and informational events. In 2019, we organised the Albert
Ballin Forum, a public podium discussion on the topic of
globalisation in which prominent guests took part (see
Albert Ballin Forum, p. 93). We also stay in touch with
the public through the local press at our sites around the
world.
Memberships — 102-13
Hapag-Lloyd is a member of various associations, working groups and institutions, and is committed to shaping
and working on various topics. One example of this is the
Präventionsfachausschuss See (Maritime Expert Committee for Prevention) of the German Employers’ Liability
Insurance Association (BG)-Transport. Another example
is our joining the Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative
(SRTI) in 2018. By joining the initiative, we want to guarantee environmentally friendly ship recycling with safe
working conditions. In 2019, we joined the Digital Container Shipping Association and provide it with its Deputy
Chair. The aim of the organisation founded in April 2019
is to harmonise standards between the major shipping
companies and make it easier to exchange information on
topics such as container tracking, port processes, cyberattacks, etc. At the end of the reporting year, we also
joined the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre,
an international non-profit organisation. This non-profit is
committed to compliance with human rights in a business
and corporate context and promotes dialogue and the
exchange of information on this topic. It also tracks and
documents current national and international trends in
terms of mandatory due diligence regarding human rights
and the environment.
In this report, we focus on memberships where we have
made a notable contribution or where major topics were
advanced during the reporting period. Not all of our memberships are listed here.

Corporate
governance and
compliance
It is only when our business partners trust our
company and its management, and look on
Hapag-Lloyd as a credible partner, that we can be
economically successful over the long term. We
achieve this through Group-wide corporate governance and compliance requirements, one of which is
our Global Code of Ethics.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE — 102-12
Good corporate governance forms the core of responsible
management that is geared towards sustainable appreciation. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board use the
applicable laws, in particular the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the German Corporate Governance
Code (GCGC) to manage and monitor the Company.
Both boards affirm their commitment to the GCGC every
year with a Declaration of Conformity in accordance with
Section 161 AktG. In addition, the Executive Board and
Supervisory Board report on corporate governance in the
yearly Corporate Governance Report (see 2019 Annual
Report, p. 19 et seq.), which is published along with the
declaration on corporate governance. It also lists the
members of the Executive Board. — NfR

­

23

One of Hapag-Lloyd’s funda­
mental goals is to provide
humane working conditions.
Amongst other things, the
Global Code of Ethics regulates compliance with appropriate working hours, minimum
wages and fair remuneration.

We are expressly committed
to fair competition as well as
compliance with all applicable national and international
laws, in particular with regard
to corruption, bribery and
price fixing. Compliance with
laws, the avoidance of corruption and bribery, and compliance with human rights are
guaranteed for our business
partners via the Global Code
of Ethics and the Supplier
Code of Conduct.

“Contributing fairly to ­society”:
Hapag-Lloyd is aware of
its responsibility to provide
fair, transparent company
­taxation, for example through
its tax compliance
management system.

COMPLIANCE
— 205/103, 205-2, 206/103, 307/103, 408/103, 409/103, 412/103, 419/103

We attach great importance to compliance with laws,
standards and requirements throughout the entire company, without exception. Compliance not only ensures that
we act within the law but is also of growing importance to
third parties. — NfR
Regulatory frameworks continue to develop, however. For
us as a global company, adapting to them is a continual

challenge as the increase in the legislative burden requires
us to revise our processes and measures so we can
implement applicable law throughout the Group and monitor compliance. — NfR
Our company also expressly supports fair competition.
This includes compliance with all applicable national and
international laws, particularly with regard to corruption,

24

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 9

bribery and price fixing. We do not tolerate any violations
of laws that are associated with them. We also take legal
action to pursue violations. A relevant statement from the
Executive Board affirms our position on this. As a new
member of the Executive Board, Dr Maximilian Rothkopf
also signed this compliance statement during the reporting year. — NfR
Hapag-Lloyd joined the global anti-corruption network
MACN (Maritime Anti-Corruption Network) in 2018. This
underlines our mission to take an active role in combating
corruption in the maritime industry. More than 100 players in the maritime industry have joined MACN since late
2018. MACN works with major stakeholders, including
national governments and supranational organisations
such as the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP). The aim is to identify and minimise corruption
in the maritime shipping industry. Joint projects form the
basis for the success of MACN, which focused on India,
Argentina and Nigeria during the reporting period. — NfR
— 102-12

Compliance organisation — 205-2
We implement our compliance organisation measures as
part of Hapag-Lloyd’s compliance programme, through
which we ensure compliance with laws and external
and internal guidelines. The Chief Compliance Officer
heads the central Compliance department and reports
to the Chief Financial Officer. Our compliance officers are
responsible for implementing the Group-wide compliance
programme in the regions and national affiliates. The

Executive Board and the Supervisory Board are regularly
updated via compliance reports. — NfR
Global Code of Ethics — 102-16, 406/103, 407/103
The intrinsic values of our corporate culture form the basis
for the work of the Compliance department. We have formalised them in the Global Code of Ethics and integrated
them in numerous Group-wide and regional regulatory
frameworks. In its Global Code of Ethics, Hapag-Lloyd
defines the behaviour we expect from management and
employees when working with colleagues, customers and
partners, and which principles underlie this behaviour. The
guideline is available in German, English, Chinese, Portuguese and Spanish. — NfR
The first basic value of the Global Code of Ethics is the
observance of human rights. In this regard, the guideline draws directly on the United Nations’ Universal
­Declaration of Human Rights. The code also reflects the
content of the International Labour Organization’s core
labour standards, such as the prohibition of all forms of
discrimination, as well as the prohibition of child or forced
labour and sub-standard working conditions. It also formalises the right to freedom of association and collective
bargaining. — NfR
The Ethics Committee is responsible for compliance with
the Global Code of Ethics. It comprises the heads of the
Compliance, Corporate Audit and Human Resources
departments. — NfR

statement satisfy external compliance regulations and

scenarios that are highly recognisable to the participant.
Participants rated the revised training design very positively, singling out the interactive, entertaining nature of the
training and its practical relevance. — NfR

The content of the Global Code of Ethics also corresponds to the regulations of the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC). In order to ensure that these regulations
– and our Global Code of Ethics – are complied with at
sea as well, audits are carried out for the entire fleet by the
respective flag state or classification society. In addition
to this, there are audits by the Port State Control. The
International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) carries
out on-board inspections on ships under its auspices to
ensure compliance with these regulations. — NfR — 412-1

Training is a major component of the compliance programme and is mandatory for all employees on land.
Around 100% of staff have already completed training.
In some cases, for example, newly hired employees have
not yet completed any training in the year under review.
— NfR

PROPORTION OF EMPLOYEES TRAINED IN COMPLIANCE
( 2 0 1 9 ) — NfR — 205-2

We also expect our business partners to comply with
our values and code of conduct. Our suppliers are thus
required to commit to the content of our supplier code
of conduct (see Sustainable procurement, p. 82 et seq.)
— NfR

Compliance training — 205-2, 407-1, 408-1, 409-1, 412-2
With our compliance management system, we implement
measures that enable us to specifically prevent breaches
of compliance. — NfR
An extensive training concept enables us to instruct our
employees in compliance-relevant expertise and to raise
awareness of the topic. The concept includes both faceto-face and online training and is continually enhanced.
On-site training is divided into compliance management
training, regular and topic-specific compliance training.
One major topic covered by this training is corruption.

Around 100%
(Hapag-Lloyd AG:
around 99%)

of our shore-based personnel participated in Web-based
­training on the topics of compliance and corruption required for 2019.

— NfR

All of our shore-based personnel are required to take part
in compliance training. In the past two years, we trained
almost all of our shore-based personnel in on-site compliance training sessions. — NfR
The training concept also includes regular online training
on the Global Code of Ethics. In 2018, we continued to
develop the online training on competition law, anti-bribery
and anti-corruption, as well as internal and external fraud.
The training was launched in February 2019 for employees
at all of our sites. In addition to the new content, we focus
on highly interactive audiovisual training. The new training
is generally based on simulations of potential business

We inform the marine personnel on board our ships, who
are supported by Fleet Management, of compliance topics
via the electronically distributed fleet circular and the
owner’s manual. Captains were trained on-site during the
reporting period. — NfR
A new on-site training concept for our shore-based personnel is planned for 2020. We began developing the
existing training programme in late 2019. The aim is to
be able to offer module-based training in future. This will
allow us to address specific topics more intensively in the
training, depending on the function. — NfR

26

Notification mechanisms
Internal and external informants can notify us of potential
breaches in compliance via our whistle-blower system.
— NfR — 205-3, 406-1, 419-1

We specifically encourage our staff to report compliance violations, or suspected ones to their superiors,
their local compliance officer or the central Compliance department. We assure them that they will not
be ­disadvantaged by reporting, regardless of whether
the violation proves to have occurred or not. The same
applies to business partners that report a potential
­violation in good faith. — NfR
Our employees and business partners can also report violations to local law firms which have been commissioned
by us. The law firms act as points of contact and mediators and ensure that the discussions are held in the relevant local language. The information may be anonymised
in accordance with locally applicable whistle-blower
protection laws and regulations before being forwarded to
the Compliance department. — NfR
Our marine personnel can report compliance violations
via a defined process known as the complaints procedure. The Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) provides
the legal framework for this process, as well as a clear
structure for reporting information to superiors, ship owners and/or external authorities, and for the resolution of a
conflict. — NfR — 102-12

No significant violations in the areas of corruption, discrimination or child and forced labour were reported via
the described whistle-blower system in the reporting
period. — NfR
Handling violations — 406/103
The Ethics Committee meets regularly, reviews suspected
violations and arranges for measures to be taken. For serious breaches or suspected cases of child labour or forced
labour, the committee meets immediately. Other than this,
it meets once a month. If necessary, it can initiate suitable
measures to address the issue (e.g. an investigation by
Corporate Audit or external specialists). If criminal violations occur, we report them to the local authorities where
appropriate. In addition, violations are prosecuted under
labour law. — NfR
We investigate all suspected cases thoroughly. If there is
credible evidence with a legal basis, we initiate the necessary legal or disciplinary measures. — NfR
If employees are found to have committed violations, this
can lead to sanctions under employment law, such as an
official warning. If a gross violation occurs, the employee’s
contract may be terminated, the matter reported to the
relevant authorities or other legal steps taken. In the event
of a serious, confirmed violation by a business partner,
we reserve the right to terminate our relationship with the
business partner immediately. — NfR

C O R P O R AT E G O V E R N A N C E A N D C O M P L I A N C E | H A PA G - L L O Y D

During the reporting year, there were no violations with
criminal implications. — NfR — 205-3, 206-1, 406-1, 419-1

RESPONSIBLE TAX POLICY — 201/103
Our principles for a responsible tax policy
Responsible tax policies are coming under greater scrutiny
in international corporations. Part of this is due to increasingly stringent legal requirements, though increasing public
awareness is also playing a role. Due to events such as
the “Panama Papers” and public investigations into the
tax policies of corporations, public perception of this issue
is highly critical.
As a traditional company, Hapag-Lloyd is aware of its
responsibility to ensure fair and transparent company
­taxation and acts according to the guiding principle of
“paying its fair share to society”. Our strategy pursues
clearly defined principles:
–	Transparent dialogue with stakeholders, particularly with
the relevant tax authorities
–	Strict compliance with all legal requirements regarding
the relevant country-specific tax situation
–	Punctual and correct payment of all corporate taxes,
under consideration of the protective effect of any bilateral agreements for the avoidance of double taxation on
corporate earnings
–	Rejection of artificial company structures created solely
for the purpose of lowering the tax burden
–	Transparency with regard to our necessary operational
presence in low-tax countries
–	Implementation of structures and processes to ensure
permanent monitoring and compliance with legal
requirements with regard to company taxation (tax compliance management)
Special tax characteristics of the shipping industry
In 1999, Hapag-Lloyd AG decided to make use of the
possibility of having its commercial activities taxed in the
Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of the transport
capacities utilised (“tonnage tax”). Under this system, the

27

tax burden is determined by the capacity of the fleet, not
by the earnings actually achieved. It requires a certain
percentage of the fleet to be registered and managed in
Germany and deployed as an international liner service.
The tonnage tax enables Hapag-Lloyd to limit its tax
burden in the Federal Republic of Germany, particularly in
periods of high earnings. On the other hand, the tonnage
tax must also be consistently applied during economically
difficult years, which results in payment of income taxes
regardless of whether the company has made a profit. The
decision to pay tonnage tax is binding for a period of ten
years. As a result, a review of the ten-year overall application period is necessary to determine whether the tonnage
tax is, or was, beneficial or detrimental.
In 2019, income tax expenses for the Hapag-Lloyd Group
under IAS 12 amounted to around EUR 43 million (see
2019 Annual Report, p. 201 et seq.). In addition, Hapag-Lloyd AG also pays cargo tax in various countries, i.e.
income tax that is not based on net profit but on various
parameters such as revenue, transport volume, etc. Total
cargo tax expenses in 2019 came to EUR 19 million.
Measured by the result before income taxes (including
cargo taxes), the tax rate of the Hapag-Lloyd Group thus
comes to approximately 14%.
Hapag-Lloyd continues to benefit from the wage tax
exemption that was introduced in Germany in 2016 for
marine personnel on ships registered under the German
flag. The regulation was initially introduced for a limited
period of five years.
There are also comparable taxation systems for shipping
companies in other European countries. As government
subsidies, they are subject to regular reviews by the
European Commission (Directorate General for Competition; DG Comp) and must comply with the EU’s State aid
guidelines. By using these provisions, Hapag-Lloyd can
remain competitive at an international level while continuing to operate ships registered under the German flag
and maintain the associated high standards under labour
and social law. In its planning for the coming financial
years, Hapag-Lloyd assumes that the Federal Republic of
Germany will continue to maintain these subsidies, and
that the European Commission (DG Comp) will consider
these German benefits unobjectionable under EU State
aid guidelines.

Tax compliance management system
As a result of its global business activities, Hapag-Lloyd
is liable to pay taxes in many countries and is subject to
highly heterogeneous regulatory requirements. Within the
context of the tightening of German criminal tax law, companies are obliged to implement a tax compliance management system for the protection of the company and its
legal representatives. The more stringent regulations mean
that even insufficient tax payments caused through negligence may still lead to the legal representative of the company being held personally liable. With the implementation
of this kind of system, the company executives meet the
increased demands in terms of the company’s internal tax
organisation, the selection of suitable specialists and the
ongoing monitoring of company processes with regard to
compliance with legal requirements in tax matters (duties
of due diligence and control).
Hapag-Lloyd started implementing its tax compliance
management system in late 2018. In doing so, Hapag-­
Lloyd is basing its system on the existing internal control
system (ICS) and integrating the monitoring of tax processes into this system. These kinds of extensive, legally
mandated tax control systems are by no means standard
everywhere in the world. Hapag-Lloyd meets very high
standards in terms of control and compliance with the
requirements of tax law. The implementation of the system
is expected to be completed by the second quarter of
2020.
Hapag-Lloyd is subject to regular tax audits around the
world and these may lead to the payment of tax arrears.
To the extent that the Company can expect to incur
charges and these charges are quantifiable, these were
accounted for by creating corresponding provisions.

Country-by-country reporting
Because Hapag-Lloyd is active around the world and
its Group revenue exceeds EUR 750 million, the company is subject to new requirements on the disclosure
of certain country-specific corporate indicators, known
as ­country-by-country reporting. This legal reporting
requirement for the mutual disclosure of information draws
on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development’s (OECD’s) initiatives under the BEPS (base
erosion and profit shifting) programme. Hapag-Lloyd is in
full observance of the legal requirements for submitting
­country-by-country reports in the national ­headquarters
of its Group parent company (Germany). As such,
­Hapag-Lloyd reports transparently about all of its company results and tax payments in the countries in which
it is represented by its affiliates.
Alongside the traditionally complex German tax law,
requirements in terms of transparency and documentation are also increasing in other countries such as the
UK, where the publication of a company’s tax policy or
­strategy is mandatory. In addition, the European Union
(EU) is also setting new transparency standards in DAC6
reporting with regard to cross-border transactions in
international corporations. This reporting standard
requires that a wide range of cross-border arrangements
and transactions to the affected EU member states be
reported automatically by the companies themselves and
their external consultants. The internal implementation of
the new requirements in 2020 will require the expansion
of our reporting requirements within the company, as well
as the implementation of technical solutions for external
notification to the relevant EU states. Hapag-Lloyd will, of
course, fully comply with its new obligations.

Management
approach
— 401/103

We want to be a responsible and attractive employer to our
staff worldwide. Their contribution makes it possible for
us to provide our customers with the best service. We invest specifically in the training and further education of our
skilled workers and managers, as well as in the professional and personal development of young talent. Maintaining a
positive corporate culture and a healthy and safe working
environment are very important to us. — NfR
Around 13,000 people are employed by Hapag-Lloyd
around the world. This results in a range of challenges
for our human resources management. One that we are
confronted with in many countries is ensuring the right
level of qualification for our staff. The size of the ships is
increasing while crew numbers remain stable. This means
that their workload is higher and our marine personnel are
subject to new, more demanding requirements. In order to
ensure that our employees are still able to work in a safe
environment despite these developments, we increasingly
use digital training tools. Particularly in the marine division,

and requests.

recruit qualified specialists globally and ensure they stay
with us over the long term. We do this by presenting ourselves as a future-oriented, modern employer that is still
aware of its heritage, implementing numerous ­measures
to boost our appeal as an employer. In Germany and
other countries, we carry out targeted recruitment campaigns to counter the lack of qualified staff. Our own
training in both the shore-based and marine divisions,
global job opportunities, international work, transparent
holiday and shift planning, family-friendly policies and
permanent contracts in the marine division are other
important factors. Our employees’ long average period of
employment shows us that our measures are successful.

Recruitment and retention of qualified employees is also
fundamentally challenging in our industry. We want to

ORGANISATION OF HUMAN RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT
The remit of the central HR Management team is to
ensure that there are globally uniform standards for the
relevant employee issues to the greatest extent possible,
and to provide appropriate support to our regional units
in their own HR activities. — NfR
The Human Resources (HR) area at our headquarters is
responsible for our employees on land. It is divided into a
German HR Management department (HR Germany) and
an international department (Corporate HR and Global
HR). A third area, Marine Human Resources (Marine HR),
is responsible for our employees at sea. — NfR

Multi-stage restructuring in human resources
management
One organisational challenge in 2019 was the multi-stage
restructuring of roles within human resources management at our global headquarters. This process saw the
individual areas of responsibility and HR processes more
clearly defined and differentiated from one another. The
aim is to strengthen interaction and cooperation with the
regions and to create the framework for cross-regional
application of best regional practices. In this way, we can
pursue a consistent global approach. These adjustments
will continue in 2020. — NfR
Clear responsibilities in all departments
In addition to our senior executives, Corporate HR supports employees sent abroad (expatriates) and is responsible for the application of global policies and guidelines.
These are also implemented in the marine division if
appropriate and legally possible. Global HR is responsible
for remuneration policies and global HR-­related change
initiatives. This department also lends conceptual support to employee development, both globally and for
the German organisation. It includes advice, coaching,
training and chairing, as well as international development programmes such as the Talent Development Programme (TDP) and the Agile Leadership Programme at
Hapag-Lloyd (ALPHA). Global HR acts as an advisor to
the regional HR areas when needed, and manages uniform global performance reviews within the framework of
our Global Staff Dialogue (GSD) (see Training and further
education, p. 38 et seq.). This area is also responsible for
recruiting and training. — NfR
The HR departments of the individual regions are responsible for human resources management at a regional
level. They cooperate with Corporate and Global HR, are
in direct communication with the HR departments at the
local sites and manage the implementation of employee
development measures at the local level. — NfR

HR management together with the Executive Board.
This department is subject to the International Safety
Management (ISM) code (see Safe ship operations, p. 53
et seq.) and undergoes internal and external audits every
year, for example by Hapag-Lloyd’s Corporate Audit or
global Compliance departments. During the reporting
period, the Marine HR department continued to standardise its processes. It is now able to offer standardised
training across the regions, for example. — NfR
There were some organisational changes in the Marine
HR area in 2019. In Ship Management in Dubai, the
organisational structures were improved, task assignment was adjusted, workflows were standardised and
responsibilities clearly assigned. The primary aims of
these adjustments were to:
–	Increase efficiency in the recruitment, deployment
­planning and support of marine personnel
–	Improve communication with internal and external
­partners
–	Improve documentation and reporting
–	Enhance identification with Hapag-Lloyd as a company

The HR Germany and Marine HR departments advise
company management and managers on HR issues and
work with the co-determination bodies. — NfR
Marine HR is in charge of HR matters pertaining to the
sea-based organisation, the planning and ­implementation
of training and further education programmes and certifications (see Health and safety, p. 47 et seq.). The

In 2019, around 13,000 people (2018: around 12,800
people) were employed by Hapag-Lloyd. 10% of our
employees on land1 are based in the global headquarters,
16% in North Europe, 9% in South Europe, 12% in North
America, 12% in Latin America, 30% in Asia and 11%
in the Middle East. The number of employees increased
slightly in 2019. This is due to investments and changes
associated with setting up Quality Service Centers. The
changed allocation of our Global Service Centers in India
from the Middle East region to the Asia region explains the
year-on-year change in the figures for these two regions.

EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION | EMPLOYEES

Employee recruitment and retention
One of the most important tasks of our human resources
management is the recruitment and retention of employees with relevant qualifications. We can only do this if we
are seen as an attractive employer. We offer appealing social benefits, measures to reconcile career and family life,
and support programmes for young professionals, where
local conditions allow.

EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT — 401/103, 404/103
In addition to good training, we want to offer young people a long-term perspective with interesting opportunities
for personal and professional development, and to motivate them to stay with the company for a long time. For
this reason, we approach trainees early, within the framework of vocational training and instruction or a degree
programme.
We continue to observe a downward trend in applicants
for classic apprenticeships on land in Germany, and find
that more young people are choosing to study instead.
Competition is particularly intense when it comes to
trainees in the area of IT. It is all the more important that
we impress them with our company so we can cover our
needs. We aim to appeal to this target group with marketing initiatives, primarily via digital channels such as our
trainee Instagram account. We also continue to take part
in various career orientation events and specifically target
young talent at fairs, on career portals and in personal
meetings. In addition, we offer annual scholarships to IT
students.
In the marine division, the trainees on our ships registered
under the German flag generally take up a course of study
following their apprenticeships. As a result, there is no
decrease in trainee numbers to report. If the number of
graduates and/or people returning from studies is low,
we may hire external nautical and technical officers in
exceptional circumstances. We continue to recruit chief

engineers and captains on ships registered under the
German flag only by supporting and promoting our own
young professionals. On ships that are not operated under
the German flag, we recruit trainees with the relevant qualifications. Prior to graduating from degree programmes,
future employees complete a 12-month stint on board the
ships to gain practical experience.
There are many arguments in favour of choosing to work
at Hapag-Lloyd, which we communicate intensively. For
example, we offer our employees the company’s internal
social benefits and promote a pleasant work atmosphere
and an appropriate work-life balance. Thanks to our international orientation, our employees also have the opportunity to work all over the world. The increasing financial
success of our company is also a strong argument in
favour of choosing Hapag-Lloyd. With its Strategy 2023,
Hapag-Lloyd has developed a credible and long-term
strategy for the future that distinguishes our company
from the competition (see Employee retention, p. 34 et
seq.).
Our goal is to also create an attractive working environment at sea. For example, all newly hired EU sailors on
our ships under the German flag receive permanent
­contracts with long-term career perspectives – not a given
in our industry (see Employee retention, p. 34 et seq.).
As part of our efforts to develop new young employees,
we work closely with the Hamburg School of Business
Administration (HSBA) and the Nordakademie. We offer

34

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 9

four places per year on a combined vocational training
and degree programme at the Nordakademie and are
represented on the Employers’ Advisory Council. At the
HSBA, we offer eight places on a combined vocational
training and degree programme and are also involved in
the company work group, speed networking events and
information days. We also support the accreditation/re­accreditation of its courses and international programmes
such as the HSBA summer school.

In order to strengthen loyalty to the company, we offer
all our employees worldwide attractive benefits in their
employment contracts.
Social benefits
In addition to competitive remuneration and employee participation in the company’s success, our attractive country and region-specific social benefits are an important
instrument for employee retention. For example, unlike in
Germany, in some countries, statutory health insurance
for general healthcare is insufficient for our employees on
land. Where possible, we compensate for this with additional voluntary health insurance. Also available are voluntary accident insurance that exceeds statutory protection,
and pension and life assurance options.

In Germany, we also provide capital-forming benefits
and an extra month’s salary. Also a matter of course for
us are paid leave in certain situations such as after the
birth of a child or the death of a parent, and assistance in
emergency situations through the Präsident-Achelis-Elisabeth-Wiegand-Stiftung foundation. Since late 2019, we
have offered all of our German employees a public transport allowance.

 s at 31.12.2019 – marine and shore-based personnel, excluding apprentices –

Employees on ships registered under the German flag
receive permanent contracts and are entitled to capital-forming benefits. Senior staff receive an employer
contribution towards sick pay. Social benefits on board
ships registered under other flags are determined by the
relevant ship management company or the agency that
hired the seafaring staff.
Modern working environments
We want to offer our employees around the world an
attractive working environment with modern workplaces.
With its modern open-plan concept, the Knowledge
Center in Poland follows the standard of the Quality
Service Center that opened the previous year in Suzhou
(China). Open-plan spaces facilitate personal exchange,
while mobile, versatile dividing walls enable a more
focused working environment. With various-sized meeting
rooms, collaboration zones and glass acoustic booths,
we have created spaces for getting together and working
alone. The new spatial concept thus fulfils all requirements
for agile project work.

EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION | EMPLOYEES

Supporting marine personnel
At Hapag-Lloyd, we promote the retention of our marine
personnel through various measures. One-on-one conversations with the captains are an important step in the
debriefing process following a voyage. If requested, we
carry out these conversations with any other employee
as well. We discuss the technical side of the journey, the
performance of the employee, and further deployment
planning, accounting for social aspects such as the
compatibility of career and family life. We look together at
existing systems and processes in order to improve the
working environment, regarding the increasing administrative burden, for example.
Marine personnel who fall under the Fleet Management
department in Germany and Dubai are supported by our
crew managers on land. We place particular value on the
expertise of the crew managers and their unrestricted
contactability for the employees. Many of these crew
managers have gone to sea themselves and can therefore
contribute a great deal of experience and knowledge.

35

Promoting the relationship between shore and
sea-based personnel
We promote the relationships between employees on
shore and at sea. We do this via a shared starter week for
apprentices, for example. Shore-based apprentices also
have the option of sailing on a ship for two or three days
for training purposes to get a better idea of the workflows. We also regularly give our shore-based personnel
the opportunity to visit Hapag-Lloyd ships to gain a better
understanding of the work done by their colleagues at sea.
As part of a Board Management meeting this year, Fleet
Management employees from the Hamburg headquarters
met with nearly 70 captains and senior management at
sea to discuss current issues and develop better understanding by gaining insight into each other’s work. We
also organise annual crew conferences in Manila for the
Filipino marine personnel who are hired via agencies.
These events are attended by representatives from the
Marine HR team. Ship Management in Dubai organises
similar events.
We encourage every manager in the company to assess
how satisfied employees are in their day-to-day roles and
to take suitable action if needed. They are supported by
the HR departments, which monitor development measures in various teams. In 2019, this primarily took the form

36

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 9

of overseeing and moderating change processes – generally with external, professional facilitators. Training also
took place on the topic of “Staying healthy in times of
change”. Team building is an essential topic, particularly
on board our ships. Appropriate actions are planned and
carried out on a ship-by-ship basis.
Work-life balance — 401/103
We are convinced that our employees can only work to
the best of their abilities and develop their potential when
a balance between work life and home life is achieved
and they can reconcile the demands of their work and
personal lives. We have established a parent/child office
at our headquarters, for example. Outside of Germany,
we also offer flexitime, the option to work from home and
other working time arrangements if this is legally possible
and compatible with work processes.

to travel on board with them. This option was used by
around 15 employees in 2019. With these measures,
planning reliability is increased for our company and our
employees, thus making career and family life more compatible.
Shore leave, on-board leisure activities and – where possible – internet access at sea increase the range of leisure
options during deployment times. To support the crew’s
welfare, we also organise events, provide bereavement
assistance and ensure health care on board.
Personnel on our ships under the German flag are
employed for an average of around eight years1, which is
above the industry average. This shows that we are adopting the right measures for employee retention.
S TA F F

If we send shore-based personnel abroad, we make
every effort to make these postings transparent and fair.
During their placement abroad, we provide professional
advice and support to our employees. For example, we
facilitate “look and see” trips so they can prepare for the
placement abroad as effectively as possible. Placements
abroad, which generally last between two and five years,
are managed throughout the Group via the Global Mobility
Policy. We also adhere to defined standards in terms of
remuneration, employee benefits and support services
(for example, with regard to tax law) and provide adequate safeguards. Family members who will be joining the
employee are also taken into account.
Our marine personnel in particular are often separated
from their families and social networks as a result of their
jobs. Irregular working hours, seven-day working weeks
and limited leisure activities are also challenging for them.
For this reason, we introduced flexitime and relatively
short deployment times on our ships under the German
flag. Also, in accordance with the “one for one” regulation
of the collective bargaining agreement for the German
shipping industry, marine personnel receive one day off
on land for each day they serve on board to compensate
for the additional burden. Where possible, we also consider personal requests such as holiday planning when
drawing up our rosters. In addition, family members of the
crew, such as spouses, partners or children, are allowed

Co-determination — 102-41
Many employees want to take part in important decision-making processes and suggest their own ideas. This
strengthens their loyalty to the company. In accordance
with the local legal situation, works councils and similar
bodies in Germany and other countries enable employee
and employer representatives to communicate in a confidential and constructive manner. All employees can make
suggestions on improvements via the company suggestion scheme.
Our management staff throughout Europe work together
closely with the national works councils. In Germany, the
works council plays a significant role in the implementation
of a wide range of topics, such as integration, restructuring, reorganisation or agreements on employee review
systems. In other countries (mainly Europe), works councils or similar bodies (Latin America and the west coast of
the USA) also usually have co-determination and/or information rights in the event of reorganisations and mergers
if they will result in job changes or job losses.
All employees on ships registered under the German flag
are also represented by the marine works council. Furthermore, the staff from the entire fleet are represented by the
International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) (see Fair
pay and salaries, p. 37).
Fair pay and salaries — 102-13, 102-41
Paying our staff a fair wage is a key element in providing an attractive working environment. Under our Global
Code of Ethics (see Compliance, p. 23 et seq.), we are
committed to complying with all local guidelines on working times, minimum wages and fair pay throughout the
Group. — 102-16
We are members of the employers’ association Hamburg
Shipowners’ Association (Verein Hamburger Rheder),
which in turn is a member of the collective bargaining
community that concludes contracts for employees of
the Hamburg Transport Industry. The Community of
Employers’ Associations has negotiated independent
pay agreements with the service workers’ union ver.di
for our land-based staff in Germany. These agreements
cover minimum working conditions and minimum wages,
among other things. As per Section 5 (3) of the German
Works Constitution Act (BetrVG), senior executives are not
covered by these agreements.

A total of around 63% of all personnel (Hapag-Lloyd AG:
around 96%) are covered by collective bargaining agreements (as at 31 December 2019).
Our marine personnel are covered by independent pay
agreements which we have entered into with ver.di
­­
through our membership in the collective bargaining
community of the German Shipowners’ Association (VDR)
and through the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF). In accordance with the requirements of the
ITF, 100% of marine personnel in our entire fleet receive
remuneration commensurate with collective agreements.
In Germany, the seafarers’ collective bargaining agreement
also applies to marine personnel on ships registered under
the German flag.
We also apply all the regulations of the Maritime Labour
Convention (MLC), thus going far beyond the legal minimum requirements. — 102-12
For employees on ships registered under the German flag,
we also grant profit-sharing and anniversary bonuses,
as well as other bonuses and an extra month’s salary,
depending on the position.
When calculating and agreeing on remuneration in line
with duties, performance and the market in general, it is
irrelevant to us whether the employee is male or female.
The equal treatment of women and men means that gender cannot, of course, be a factor in determining salaries.

We offer our employees
a range of training and

of our ALPHA and TDP
international development measures.

As a company, we are highly committed to learning and
further education. We set great store by the continued
development of our employees and offer them high-quality
education options. — NfR

In 2019, we invested a total of EUR 4.9 million2 globally
(Hapag-Lloyd AG: around EUR 2.5 million2) in the training
of our employees. We also implemented a wide range of
additional internal qualification and training measures. — NfR

For several years, the annual employee dialogue processes (Global Staff Dialogue) have formed an important basis for dialogue on areas for development and
employee potential. Furthermore, the range of education
options is continually being expanded and improved,
whether by new development programmes or specific
training topics. — NfR

In terms of training and further education on land, the
focus during the reporting year was on launching a new
learning management system (LMS). At sea, the focus
was on training in LNG (liquefied natural gas). Through
training we have prepared the crews for the operation of
the container ship “Sajir” with LNG (see Environmental and
climate protection, p. 67 et seq.).

internal presentations on specialist topics are also part
of Hapag-Lloyd’s high-quality training programme. Close
mentoring of the apprentices by internal coaches is also
very important to us. — NfR
Outside Germany and the German apprenticeship system,
onboarding of new employees takes place individually
depending on the region, position, and employees’ experience.
Apprenticeships at sea
For anyone interested in working at sea, Hapag-Lloyd
trains ship mechanics, nautical officer’s assistants and
technical officer’s assistants. There is a particular need
for apprentices in electrical engineering, e.g. for electrical
engineering and automation technology assistants. — NfR
Our German apprentices at sea undergo a three-week
starter training course together with the apprentices on
land. This is followed by group training lasting several
months in a training centre and on our training ships. The
topics of team building and health and safety are key
focus areas. Shore leave and leisure activities are also an
important component of this time spent together. Various
specialist training sessions and courses such as basic
safety training or metal-working apprenticeships round
off the group training. During the entirety of their training,
apprentices are looked after by the Marine HR department. — NfR

Open communication and comprehensive support during
the training phase is very important to us. For this ­reason,
Hapag-Lloyd apprentices take part in regular interim
feedback meetings and receive help preparing for exams
through internal and external courses. — NfR

INTERVIEW WITH
DEMOSTHENES C. QUINONES

Repairing instead of
replacing: Working
sustainably on board
been repeatedly started for testing. Using my electronic
diagram, I figured out that this caused a fuse to blow,
which prevented the engine from starting. We didn’t have
the right spare parts on board, but we had to come up
with a solution, as we were worried that there might be
an inspection at the next port. I managed to temporarily
bypass this fuse with what we had on board. When we
were in port two days later, we were able to correct the
fault with the right spare parts.

Demosthenes C. Quinones worked for more than 20 years as an
electrical engineer on board various Hapag-Lloyd ships. Today, he
mainly recruits electrotechnicians and electrical engineers for Jebsen
Maritime, the crew-management agency of the Abojeb Company of
the Jebsens Group. Hapag-Lloyd has already been working with the
Filipino agency for 22 years.

You worked on board as an electrical
engineer for a long time. Today, you recruit
engineers and electricians. What makes a
good technician?
Electricians and electrical engineers have a lot of responsibility on board. After all, whether it has to do with the
engine controls, nautical devices, refrigerated containers
or anchoring equipment, technical problems can pop up
anywhere. And, if they do, it can present a major risk to
safety.
For example, when I was sailing on the “Kyoto Express”
many years ago, the lifeboat didn’t work properly. You
could start it, but the battery was weak because it had

For me, that’s what distinguishes a good electrician:
having the will to figure out what the defect is and then,
if possible, to work with spare parts. As a result, you can
keep the device. That saves money – but, most importantly, it’s sustainable.
How do you determine whether an applicant
is suitable for the job?
I built myself a switching box here that is similar to the one
I used to always have with me on board for training purposes. After tinkering with it, I present the applicants with
practical problems that they then have to solve.
In the process, I always learn something new myself –
but, on the other hand, I like to teach my counterparts
something, too. That’s how I always did it on board, and
anyone who was interested in learning something was
welcome to do so. My last cadet went from being able to
solve problems in 10 minutes at first to only needing two
minutes. Something like that naturally fills me with pride.
What was your approach to dealing with
­problems in your everyday life at work?

41

The first thing I did was to take a look at the wiring diagram. For me, this is the starting point for every challenge:
It displays the circuitry and how the various wires should
be connected to each other. By doing so, I can pinpoint
possible sources of the problem.
Once, when I arrived at the port of Kuala Lumpur on
board the “Ludwigshafen Express”, I wanted to say hello
to the crew of the “Frankfurt Express”, which I had worked on for a long time. There was a periodically recurring
alarm on board, and nobody knew how to fix it. So, I had
a look at the wiring diagram. It turned out that the only
thing wrong was the time setting – a simple solution to a
seemingly complex problem that had plagued the team for
some time.
It sounds like you’ve already earned a reputation for being a reliable “fixer”?
Well, I guess you could say that. Thanks to stable internet
connections on board, I still often receive inquiries about
technical problems from former colleagues. That makes me
very happy – and, of course, I’m glad to help. If everything
is working on board, especially the technical equipment, it
also has a positive impact on the quality and safeness of the
work. And I’m happy to do my part to make this happen.

FURTHER EDUCATION

— 404-1

The demands on our employees in their day-to-day
work are growing all the time. With our further education
programmes, we want to prepare our employees worldwide for new tasks and challenges. The comprehensive
qualification options available are a way of strengthening
their ties with Hapag-Lloyd. The range of further education formats available includes Web-based and virtual
classroom training as well as on-site events. In 2019, we
invested an average of around 21 hours (Hapag-Lloyd AG:
around 17 hours) per employee in further education. We
review the success of the measures at regular intervals
and adjust them as necessary. We also offer local training
sessions. — NfR
Global Staff Dialogue — 404-2, 404-3
All shore-based personnel worldwide engage in a Global
Staff Dialogue (GSD) with their supervisors at least once a
year; this is a structured discussion of their performance,
skill sets and areas for development and potential. This
annual discussion took place with nearly 100% of shorebased personnel in 2019 (the remainder were recent
hires or cases of illness). During the meeting, participants
discuss developments during the year, joint targets for
work and development, and suitable further educational
measures. These may include training in Microsoft Office,

travel safety and intercultural skills, or tailored development measures to be implemented by the HR department.
The aim of the GSD is to gauge employee potential for
their future professional development and to identify and
implement developmental measures together with the
senior executive. — NfR
Past staff dialogues show that the biggest development
requirements are in subject-specific topics, languages
and soft skills. As a result, in addition to specialist training,
more language courses and soft skill development measures have been implemented. — NfR
Learning management system
In 2019, preparations for the launch of a learning management system (LMS) were largely completed. The unified
system will manage and track the measures agreed to in
the GSD. The central system will support staff dialogues
based on globally consistent standards, while still allowing
for them to be held locally. — NfR
The new LMS will be used by senior executives and participating employees over the course of next year to keep
an overview of the content discussed. This will increase
the transparency of the agreed objectives and will promote dialogue. The system is slated for global roll-out in
mid-2020. — NfR

Talent Development Programme — 404-2
We offer a locally managed, three-year Talent Development Programme (TDP) for employees on land with excellent performance and high potential for development. The
TDP provides our employees worldwide with support on
both an individual and collective level. They are mentored
by instructors from the areas of HR management and
development, the supervisor and internal mentors. — NfR
The programme has been a complete success: more than
500 employees have already participated in the TDP. — NfR
Agile Leadership Programme at Hapag-Lloyd — 404-2
The Agile Leadership Programme at Hapag-Lloyd
(ALPHA) was implemented in 2018 as the successor to
the Management Career Program (MCP). The international development programme, managed centrally in
Hamburg, is tailored to management staff working on
land. It lasts three years and focuses on a different topic

team in the areas of software development and the implementation of processes (see Digitalisation, p. 60 et seq.).
Further education at sea — 404-2
The crews on board our ships also have access to expert,
targeted further education. To this end, we have implemented an expertise management system on ships registered under the German flag. In regular dialogue with their
superiors, the management and employee work out their
individual development requirements and agree on suit­
able training measures. This results in an ongoing expansion of our need-oriented training sessions. — NfR
Employees on board our ships receive training on a wide
range of topics. In 2019, the focus of further education for
employees at sea was on training in LNG (liquefied natural
gas). These measures aimed to prepare our crews for the
retrofitting of the “Sajir” so that it can be powered by LNG
(see Environmental and climate protection, p. 67 et seq.).

Agile methods
The working environment is increasingly complex and
unpredictable. Agile and flexible working methods are
increasingly important so that individuals can act quickly
and actively. Agile methods are therefore a fixed element
of the development programmes for our management
staff. The significance of these methods becomes clear in
our daily work. For example, an agile project management

Further education on board ships registered under the
German flag takes several forms: marine personnel, for
example, take part in e-leaning modules or multi-day
courses on legislation, language courses, and training
in the Electronic Chart Display and Information System
(ECDIS). — NfR
The ongoing training and further education of our employees pays off in particular during critical situations at sea.
During a fire on one of Hapag-Lloyd’s ships in 2019, the
well-qualified, trained staff on board were able to avoid
injuries or even loss of crew and the sinking of the vessel.
An important prerequisite for the marine personnel's fast,
correct action was their proper training and their compliance with our high safety standards for operation at sea
(see Health and safety, p. 47 et seq.). — NfR

Open corporate
culture
Hapag-Lloyd is a traditional Hamburg company and
active around the world. Hanseatic values are just
as important to our business success as the cultural
and social diversity of our staff. We’re convinced that
these qualities are what make our corporate culture
truly special.

CORPORATE VALUES
For Hapag-Lloyd, the successful implementation of Strategy 2023 will involve subjecting our own corporate culture
to an intensive appraisal. During the second half of 2019,
we carried out a global employee survey on this subject
as well as a range of workshops with different groups of
employees. Based on this, a global roll-out of our corporate values, and their integration into existing HR tools, is
planned for 2020.

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
— 405/103, 406/103

Hapag-Lloyd is a global company with employees on all
five continents. Our marine and shore-based personnel is
correspondingly diverse. Our employees come from various cultures. They bring differing social backgrounds and
different ways of thinking, perspectives, and experiences
to our company. Hapag-Lloyd sees this as great added
value, which we want to maintain and promote over the
long term. In our day-to-day communication with our customers and partners, we benefit from the cultural, social
and linguistic differences of our employees and achieve
better results over the long term thanks to the varying approaches and perspectives. Furthermore, our employees
develop a better understanding and greater tolerance of
distinctive cultural features and differences. This also benefits them outside the organisation. Global projects enable
us to strengthen cooperation between different nationali-

Equal opportunities for all employees — 102-12
We are expressly committed to the diversity recommendations of the Government Commission for the German
Corporate Governance Code (GCGC). We have firmly
incorporated the objectives of the Diversity Charter into
our corporate culture. Throughout the Group, we foster
the talents of all our employees irrespective of gender,
nationality, ethnic origin, religion and ideology, disability,
age, sexual orientation and identity. We hire new employees solely on the basis of their qualifications, social
skills and their readiness and ability to perform the work.
This also applies to people with disabilities, who we want
to include in our operational workflows and the social
environment of our Company in the same way we do
any employee. Our hiring processes are governed by
country-specific regulations in this respect, such as the
German General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG). The

do this, we hold regular events, such as self-marketing for
women and the Women’s Business Forum. The Women’s
Business Forum is one of our most successful formats
and has been held since 2015. It enables us to support
young female skilled workers and managers through
opportunities for further education and networking. They
are also able to engage with experienced female managers at the third and fourth management level.

Women in management positions — 405-1
As at 31 December 2019, the percentage of women
in management positions on land (levels 2 and 3) was

up for. Events such as the weekly “Lunch with the Management” enable our staff to get to know our second and
third-tier management better.
Through ALPHA and TDP, we also ensure regular dialogue and networking between top management and
participants.
We promote dialogue between management and
employees at sea through various formats such as
“Board Management Tables”, open forums and crew
conferences.

THE HAPAG-LLOYD MANAGEMENT CULTURE
— 404/103

A positive relationship between senior executives and
employees is particularly important to us. Flat hierarchies,
efficient decision-making pathways and easy communication between the various management levels are therefore
key elements of our corporate management strategy.
In 2019, leadership was a key topic in the development
of our organisation. This focus will continue in 2020. We
want to develop a unified understanding of leadership
throughout the Group.
In 2019, the two-day Global Management Meeting which
took place in Hamburg was attended by 150 senior executives (senior management and young managers) from
our sites around the world. 22 nationalities were represented. The focus was on the implementation of Strategy
2023 and the progress made so far.
Our top management adheres to an open-door principle
throughout the company. Any employee can approach
any executive. In addition, we hold the “Breakfast with the
Executive Board” in Hamburg, which employees can sign

Our feedback culture is based on the principle of open
communication. This allows employees to learn from their
mistakes. We thus carry out training in which managers
learn to provide their employees with regular, prompt
feedback. And naturally, we also ask our employees to
give feedback to their managers. The annual employee
meetings which take place as part of the Global Staff
Dialogue offer a formal framework for exchange between
management and employees.
In order to strengthen the dialogue beyond the company itself, Hapag-Lloyd has been working with the
charity Common Purpose since 2018. One of its aims is
to facilitate dialogue beyond the professional arena for
­management staff in Hamburg working in a variety of
fields. With our joint Navigator programme, young managers are offered a wide range of learning and networking
opportunities.

Management
approach
— 403/103

Our employees have a wide range of tasks and are correspondingly also exposed to dangers and risks in their
day-to-day work. In view of this, maintaining their health
and safety is our highest priority. We implement high
standards of health and safety which we continue to develop. One means by which we confirm the effectiveness
of these standards is through external audits of the health
and safety management system. — NfR — 403-1
Health and safety topics for the shore-based and marine
personnel in the Group, as well as in the individual
regions, are primarily anchored in the HR department. Our
management is also responsible for ensuring compliance
with the relevant regulations and for implementing internal
guidelines. — NfR — 403-4

contacts at our company headquarters. Under the direction of the health and safety officer, who is also the internal auditor for health and safety management systems
according to DIN ISO 45001, the current health and safety
situation was determined during the reporting period and
targets were set. Processes are now being established
for all health and safety-related topics that will collate the
existing individual solutions in one overall concept. The
long-term aim is to set up a certified health and safety
management system. — NfR — 403/103, 403-7

Occupational health and safety on land
In Germany, a Health and Safety Committee ensures the
health and safety of our shore-based personnel. The committee comprises the company management, the health
and safety officer, the company doctor, representatives
of the Works Council and the safety officers. At regular
meetings, the committee discusses occupational health
and safety issues, agrees on areas of action and takes
decisions on measures to be implemented. Necessary
measures for the protection of the health and safety of our
shore-based personnel are also taken in other countries.

In principle, our health and safety regulations also apply
to external employees and service providers. Responsibility for compliance with these regulations lies with the
relevant external service providers. When working at a
Hapag-Lloyd AG site, external employees are familiarised
with our health and safety requirements via an internal
form, “Guidelines for external companies and individuals
on Hapag-Lloyd AG property”. This form is signed by the
external employee and kept by us. — NfR

measures. Each SMS on board our ships is verified and
certified by international requirements. Using risk assessments and review reports, risks are documented and the
effectiveness of actions is recorded. — NfR
The need for action on health and safety is identified both
preventively and correctively through structured review
processes. The results are used to derive appropriate
protective measures. — NfR

RISK ASSESSMENT FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL
STRESS — 403-2
In 2018, we initiated the Risk Assessment for Mental
Stress (RAMS) to evaluate psychological health. It was
introduced in 2019 on ships registered under the German
flag. RAMS is a scientifically validated stress analysis
based on the EU directive on safety and health at work
and the German Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Both pieces of legislation go above and beyond international standards. The process also takes into account
findings and models from occupational psychology; its
degree of detail makes Hapag-Lloyd’s ship management
unique in the industry. — NfR
The risk assessment includes a survey, evaluation and
objectives, as well as the implementation, evaluation and
documentation of measures. It records both external
stress factors for the employees and their perceived stress
levels. — NfR
During 2018, more than 600 employees from various
areas and ranks on 38 ships were surveyed at random.
— NfR

We were able to identify risk factors such as highly repetitive tasks in the analysis. With the help of a professor of
occupational psychology as well as seafaring staff, we
then derived objectives that include alternative working
methods and topics of leadership and cooperation on
board. The measures are to be implemented starting in
2020. Ships registered under other flags fulfil the IMO and
MLC standards under international law; a wider roll-out of
RAMS measures may take place in future in the form of
specifications in the Owner’s Manual. — NfR

CERTIFIED HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ON BOARD
— 403-1, 403-3, 403-4, 403-7, 403-8

Generally speaking, health and safety on board all ships is
safeguarded by the requirements of the ISM (International
Safety Management) code. — NfR
The health and safety management system is an integral
part of the SMS and ensures a safe working environment
on board all our ships. The flag state authorities regularly
audit compliance with internationally recognised ISM
standards. — NfR
The success of the system and its acceptance among
employees on board are significantly influenced by their
active participation in regular review processes. The
systems continue to be developed based on employee
feedback. — NfR

Occupational
health and safety

— 403/103

The field of work and location of our employees determine which measures we adopt to ensure their health
and safety. These measures are both preventive and
corrective. The aim is always to maintain the long-term
ability of our employees to work. — NfR
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY

— 403-3, 403-5

There is only a low risk of injury or illness for the majority
of our employees who work in offices at our sites. The
risk is much higher for occupations in kitchens, warehouses or ports, as well as for people on business trips.
For this reason, we provide specific instruction, for example, travel safety training in which we inform people about
particular safety risks in the destination country. Since
2017, our employees worldwide have also been able to
call a central emergency number. — NfR

We contribute towards
ensuring humane working
conditions under SDG 8
through our health and
­safety measures and
activities for shore-based
and especially marine
personnel.

Ongoing improvements to fire protection
We have significantly improved the fire protection of our
headquarters in Hamburg by modernising the building
control system, which enables us to detect and eliminate
potential risks more quickly. We are currently revising
and updating our existing fire protection concept. One
particular focus in the initial phase is on the review of
our internal alarm system and processes. Since September 2019, the officers for fire protection and health
and safety have been provided by an external service
provider, which now trains employees in these topics
(see Management approach, p. 48 et seq.). Every year,

around 50 employees are trained as fire protection assistants, and as many again as first-aiders (including early
defibrillation). — NfR

Around 3.3 workplace accidents per 1,000 employees

involved. — NfR

In 2019, there were two fatal workplace accidents on

flag state authorities and will be investigated immediately
so we can identify possible causes and rule them out in
future. — NfR

Workplace accidents in 2019
We aim to continue improving workplace safety in the
company and preventing accidents. This involves recording and investigating safety-related incidents throughout
the Group and taking appropriate action to minimise workplace risks. In 2019, we recorded 0.57 accidents per ship
on all of our own ships (Hapag-Lloyd AG: 0.73 accidents
per ship)1. — NfR

HEALTH PROTECTION

— 403-6

The greatest health risks for our shore-based personnel
include lack of movement, postural damage, vision disorders and psychological stress. A wide range of regular
measures to promote health and prevent illness enables
us to actively counter these risks. For historical reasons,
Hapag-Lloyd in Germany cooperates with pronova BKK,
on whose Administrative Board we are represented, in
terms of company health care. In this way, we can help
shape the work and orientation of the health insurer, working with it to establish measures to promote health and
medical check-ups for our employees in Germany.
At least once a year, we organise free exercise initiatives
for all our employees in Germany, as well as other preventive measures. In Hamburg, these measures are supple­
mented by a wide range of fee-based sports offered
through our company sports club, and the option to make
fee-based massage appointments.
Prevention on land
One central element of our health management on land
is our health awareness day in Hamburg, which we have
held regularly since 2017 with pronova BKK and other
partners. At this event, we inform employees about
workplace design, ergonomics and preventive measures,
among other things. The key topics for 2019 were ergonomics and eye health. Employees were able to obtain
advice on ergonomic workplaces, for example. We also
inform employees about topics such as occupational
safety via online tutorials.
In 2018, we launched the “Health after work” programme
in Hamburg – a range of free health talks which take place
outside working hours. The format was continued this
year, focusing this time on the topic of breathing. For the
first time, there was a talk in English in order to reach our
colleagues with little knowledge of German. “Health after
work” was also launched at our Frankfurt site in 2019. We
carry out similar preventive measures in the other regions.
In Hamburg, additional health services are available
through our company doctor, such as first aid for acute
symptoms and risk factor assessment by means of blood
testing. Services also encompass individual counselling
on topics of health and nutrition – including information
on psychological health and addictions – as well as free

vaccinations. We evaluate psychological stress in the
workplace and take appropriate action where necessary.
Since our global sites frequently do not have staff suited to
provide these services, we offer our employees the opportunity to obtain medical advice from Germany.
Employees in Hamburg have the opportunity to consult the health and safety officer or company doctor in
person at their workplace regarding all topics pertaining
to occupational health and safety. Occupational health
care is regularly provided and carried out in line with the
Ordinance on Occupational Health Care (Verordnung zur
arbeitsmedizinischen Vorsorge, ArbMedVV).
We continually adapt all health care measures to the
needs and distinctive features of our regions, for example,
through regular participant questionnaires. For instance,
in Austria and other countries, we are required by law to
evaluate psychological stress in the workplace. — 403-6
Our range of health care options is continually being
expanded. In the future, we plan to standardise occupational health and safety as well as health promotion across
all sites in Germany.
Health management at sea
The medical care of our marine personnel is a particular
challenge for our health management team and requires
specific measures.
A basic prerequisite for deployment on ships is that the
employee be certified as fit to work at sea in accordance
with the requirements of the Maritime Labour Convention
(MLC). Fitness to work at sea is confirmed by certificates
and is monitored continually. — NfR
If necessary, medical emergencies can be supported by
land-based medical centres.

Under all circumstances, all ship managers follow the
three fundamental principles of “saving and protecting
human lives”, “safeguarding the environment and property” and “preserving our reputation”. — NfR
All Hapag-Lloyd managers and marine personnel accept
our Group-wide principles on safety and environmental
protection. For us, this is a major prerequisite for efficient
implementation of the SMS. Clear processes ensure that
our employees are familiar with the objectives of the SMS
and its principles, and that they always apply additional
standards and guidelines within their area of responsibility.
These processes are regulated and verified via the Safety
Management Manual, circulars and inspections, as well
as through the Owner’s Manual, Owner’s Circulars and
Owner’s Inspections. — NfR
Additional inspections to verify compliance with the SMS
on board include internal and external audits, flag state

Our employees are subject to specific health and safety
risks associated with ship operations. These include risks
posed by large, heavy moving equipment, stress caused
by noise and by travel through different time zones and
climates, the motion of the ship, and bad weather. There
is also a risk of accidents associated with working with
ropes and in shifts. — NfR — 403-9
The marine personnel on our ships are trained regularly
in health and safety topics specifically relating to the size
of the vessel and equipment used. Each member of the
crew is instructed in the safety features and procedures
when they start work. During sea deployments, there are
training sessions at least once a month on behaviour in
the event of a fire or evacuation. There is also training at
least once a year on various ship accident situations (such
as collisions or running aground). Regular training is also
carried out on land. For example, basic safety training
takes place every five years over the course of several
days and instructs staff in managing risks and hazards on
board. This covers survival at sea, fire extinguishing, first
aid and occupational safety training with a focus on PPE,
access to separate areas, accident prevention and health
protection. — NfR — 403-5

54

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 9

The SMS is reviewed and improved regularly to take
account of changes in the law, incidents and near accidents, and feedback from our ships. For the management
review, employees on board regularly note down relevant
points and notify their management on land. The findings
are used to help optimise ship operations. Decisions are
then communicated to the ships affected, with the instruction to implement appropriate measures. Their implementation is then monitored once again. — NfR — 403-2

AUDITS

— 403-8

We conduct internal and external audits in order to ensure
that all statutory and internal requirements regarding
occupational health and safety are met. Internal audits
take place on board our ships every year and monitor
compliance with the ISM and ISPS code2 as well as ISO
and MLC3 requirements. They also determine whether
deficiencies or areas for improvement exist. External ISM,
ISPS and MLC audits are carried out on each one of our

audits are carried out regularly on a set number of ships.
— NfR

In addition to all ships, the flag states or the classification
societies commissioned by them also verify and certify the
land-based ship management organisations every year. As
in previous years, all ship management organisations were
awarded the Document of Compliance (DOC) with no
reservations. Almost all management organizations of our
ships are also certified according to ISO 9001:2015 and
14001:2015 standards. — NfR — 403-2, 403-7

PORT STATE CONTROL
Within port state controls (PSCs), port states are permitted to establish whether all ships are in compliance with
the applicable international agreements on occupational
health and safety regulations which the port state has
ratified. The check examines the ships’ condition and
equipment and checks that they are being operated
properly. — NfR
Countries in nine regions around the world so far have
signed memoranda of understanding (MoU) regarding port
state controls. They also conduct concentrated inspection campaigns for certain key issues. In 2019, one such
MoU campaign in Paris, Tokyo, the Black Sea, the Indian
Ocean, the Mediterranean, Riyadh and Viña del Mar dealt
with emergency systems and procedures. — NfR

ACCOLADE FROM US COAST GUARD
As a result of the exceptional results of the PSCs carried
out by the United States Coast Guard (USCG), ships
under our German Fleet Management were included in the
Qualship 21 programme in 2018. Fewer than one in ten
ships operating in US waters under foreign flags manage
to fulfil the high quality and safety requirements to make
the cut. The accolade also means that the regular USCG
checks on board must now take place only once every
three years rather than every year, as was previously the
case.

CRISIS MANAGEMENT — 403-2

PIRACY AND TERRORISM — 403-2

In the event of a crisis, our Emergency Response Manual
serves as a guide to avoiding or minimising harm to people, our ships and the company. We have established the
following priorities in the manual: — NfR

Incidents falling under the category of piracy and terrorism
cannot be predicted. We comply with the guidelines on
risk avoidance, such as the Best Management Practices
to Deter Piracy and Enhance Maritime Security in the
Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea
(BMP5). The individual flag states are not in agreement
on the risk potential of the various regions and how to
respond to them. For us, this means that we have to
gauge each situation individually. Based on various independent sources of information available to us, we make
every effort to obtain the most comprehensive overview
possible of potential risks in the waters we navigate. At
the same time, we carry out individual and route-specific
risk assessments for our ships. We receive our information
from national sources such as the maritime safety report
from the Federal Criminal Police Office and the annual
report from the German Navy Command, as well as from
international institutions like the ICC International Maritime
Bureau and Flag State Advisories. We review and update
the risk assessments when necessary, but at least annually. This enables us to react quickly to changes in the
situation.

1. Save lives
2. Save the ship
3. Protect the environment
4. Prevent damage to the Company — NfR
With representatives from all relevant Hapag-Lloyd departments and external institutions, we have a team of experts
on hand to coordinate and provide assistance in the event
of an incident. The team is contactable around the clock
for our fleet and to support charter ships. Clear responsibilities and reporting channels ensure that, in crisis situations, the Executive Board can also be informed as quickly
as possible. — NfR
In early 2019, a fire broke out on board our ship “­ Yantian
Express” on its voyage from Colombo (Sri Lanka) to
Halifax (Canada). The well-trained crew was able to extinguish the fire. All crew members were unharmed. The ship
and the majority of its cargo were saved. The basis for
this exceptional outcome was the crew’s high standard
of training and further education (see Training and further
education, p. 38 et seq.). — NfR

During the reporting period for instance, we have been
closely following developments in the Strait of Hormuz,
which have been shaped by growing tensions due to
various national interests.

Dangerous
goods
— 306/103, 403-7

We transport a wide variety of goods worldwide. Some of
these must legally be declared as dangerous goods. We
implement special measures to ensure safe transport – for
our employees, the ship, the environment and the cargo.
This includes strict compliance with all laws and internal
­requirements by our shore-based and marine personnel. — NfR
We do not transport any dangerous goods unless they
meet all international, national and local laws and guidelines in full. This is our most important principle for the
transportation of any kind of dangerous goods. We are
guided by the IMDG code4, 49 CFR (US guidelines), the
German Ordinance on the Transport of Dangerous Goods
by Sea (GGVSee) and the German Dangerous Goods
Officer Ordinance (GbV). Apart from these, there is a range
of additional laws and regulations which apply to specific
modes of transport and which we adhere to. — NfR
Various aspects of a particular good are used to identify
the potential danger that it exhibits. These include its
physical and chemical properties, reactivity and stability,
and toxicological and environmental information. Following classification, all dangerous goods must be identified
using the dangerous goods class and global UN number. The combination of dangerous goods class and UN
number determine which specific requirements must be in
place when transporting the goods. — NfR
Overall, the transportation of dangerous goods accounts
for around 4% of Hapag-Lloyd’s total transport volume.
During the reporting year, Hapag-Lloyd transported more
than 500,000 TEU of dangerous goods. — NfR

REGULATIONS AND PROCESSES
The transportation of dangerous goods is highly complex
and requires careful planning by experts. For this reason,
following an extensive risk analysis, we have developed
4 IMDG Code = International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code

guidelines in line with the “Rules of Good Seamanship”
that exceed statutory requirements. For example, in order
to protect the staff and cargo, no dangerous goods may
be stored in front of or behind the crew quarters on board.
This also applies to the outsides of the ship in order to
protect the cargo from breaking waves, pirate attacks or
in the event of collisions. — NfR
All regulations and work processes relating to dangerous
goods are detailed in our Hapag-Lloyd Dangerous Goods
Manual. This manual is used by our dangerous goods
experts as well as by all relevant parties, such as ship
planners and Port Terminal Operations. The exclusion list
in the manual lists all goods we refuse to transport following a risk assessment, though it would be legally permissible to do so. If there are any changes in the risk assessment, the manual and/or the exclusion list are revised and
all relevant offices are informed immediately in writing or in
person. — NfR
Our dangerous goods experts in the regions ensure that
dangerous goods are handled properly and in compliance
with the law, both in the ports and on the ships. They also
report regularly to the central Hapag-Lloyd dangerous
goods officer. Cargo not declared as dangerous goods
is checked by our Cargo Patrol software. This software,
which was developed especially for our needs, has
already received several international awards. Systematic
searches for non-declared dangerous goods based on
keywords enabled us to identify around 3,900 bookings
during the reporting period. We then refused to transport
the goods. — NfR — 403-2

DANGEROUS GOODS TRAINING

— 403-5

Through legally mandated training in dangerous goods,
we inform our employees on board and in our offices
worldwide about the special requirements for the transport
of dangerous goods. We also describe the risks and help
employees in the best possible way to recognise irregularities and causes for concern. As a result, all employees
who deal with dangerous goods, such as captains and
cargo officers, are regularly trained by the Hapag-Lloyd
dangerous goods officer, in compliance with legal requirements under the IMDG code, the German Ordinance on
the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Sea (GGVSee), and
49 CFR. — NfR
Around 350 employees worldwide were trained in dangerous goods in on-site training sessions in 2019. Additionally we provided mandatory Web-based training, which all
relevant employees must complete. — NfR
We recorded two incidents pertaining to dangerous goods
during the reporting year, each on a charter ship. In both
cases, there was a fire in a container transporting dangerous goods. Both times, the crew managed to extinguish
the fires on board and enter a port in order to discharge
the container in question. Neither of the fires spread to
adjacent containers. As a consequence, in future we will
go above and beyond legal requirements to make sure
that containers with dangerous goods are positioned so
that they are not exposed to direct sunlight. — NfR

INITIATIVES AND MEMBERSHIPS

— 102-13

Hapag-Lloyd is a founding member and an active Executive Board member of the Cargo Incident Notification
­System (CINS). CINS is a non-profit initiative of carriers,
insurers and experts who came together in 2011 and
decided to record and evaluate cargo or container accidents in a single database. Its aim is to identify negative
developments and those requiring critical action at an
early stage, and to improve operational safety at all levels of transport. To this end, a transparent exchange of
experience and best practices has been initiated. This also
facilitates the handling of challenges resulting from leakages and incorrect declarations. CINS wants to overcome
these problems by issuing concrete guidelines. We use
our Cargo Patrol findings to inform our competitors about
cargoes with false declarations. CINS is also working
towards achieving IMO advisory status in order to play a
role in the negotiation of future provisions. — NfR
We continue to be an active member of the Association
of German Shipowners (Verband Deutscher Reeder) and
chair its Hazardous Goods committee. — NfR

Digitalisation
Strategy 2023 sets clear goals for our business success. One method of reaching these goals is to focus on
digitalising our work. By using digital solutions, we can
automate processes, continue to improve the quality of
our services and increase customer satisfaction through
more efficient interfaces.
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION SUPPORTS
STRATEGY 2023
Digitalisation is a key element of Strategy 2023 and is
reflected in our strategy goals. We are convinced that, by
improving existing systems and processes and developing
digital services and business models, we can offer our
customers the best possible quality and increase their
long-term satisfaction. For this reason, we have made
quality and customer focus goals of Strategy 2023. Based
on evaluation of customer feedback using digital solutions,
we can draw conclusions about customer satisfaction and
the quality of our services, and take appropriate action.
— NfR

The Digital Business & Transformation (DB&T) department, formerly the Digital Channel and Incubation Unit
(DCIU), provides Group-wide support for the realisation
of the digital transformation and the implementation
of ­Hapag-Lloyd’s digital business. The approximately
20 employees involved work closely with experts worldwide and keep our staff up-to-date on digital topics. They
provide support by collecting and evaluating customer
and usage data, as well as with product development and
sales and marketing optimisation.

IMPROVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
AND EFFICIENCY
In 2019, we added new features to our Quick Quotes
online tool for freight rate enquiries and bookings. For
example, we were able to simplify the booking process
based on customer usage data. The order volume via
Quick Quotes rose from around 6% in its first year to
around 10% in the reporting period.

During the reporting period, we also worked with our
customers to advance a pilot project involving the live
tracking of containers, which will be available from spring
2020. We also continued developing products such as
cargo insurance and navigation in the customer area of
our website.

INFORMING AND TRAINING EMPLOYEES
We want to make even better use of the opportunities
presented by digitalisation and are renewing our efforts to
raise awareness of digital topics among our employees.
One of the ways we do this is through the Digital Hub,
a Web-based internal platform that provides information about digitalisation and promotes dialogue among
employees on relevant topics. It also enables our employees to actively take part in the development of digital solutions in the company. The hub is becoming increasingly
recognised, and we saw a growing number of hits and
more interaction in 2019.
We now generally involve employees and customers
more closely in the product development process since
they can test products, for example. We hold deep-dive
sessions with our employees on digital products and
processes and train them on digital topics as part of staff
development. In 2018 for example, ten employees were
trained in agile project management and on topics such
as performance marketing, digital sales and digital data
evaluation. In 2019, these employees passed on their
knowledge to 100 more employees according to the “train
the trainer” principle. We will continue this approach in
2020.

INNOVATIVE DATA MANAGEMENT
In future, we want to conduct big data analyses, i.e. use
large amounts of data to quickly draw conclusions and
use the findings. With the data lake project, we are currently setting up a central database, thus creating the
technical and structural requirements for simplified evaluation and the provision of information for customers and
employees. The first pilot projects based on the data lake
were set up in 2019.
We also work together with external partners on blockchain solutions, i.e. on the decentralised, transparent
logging of processes. In July, for example, we joined the
blockchain-based platform TradeLens, whose members
are responsible for more than half of all sea containers
transported worldwide. TradeLens’s aim is to improve
cooperation within the supply chain by strengthening
networks. It facilitates transparent documentation of
transactions and data availability in real time for all of its
members. Smaller machine learning initiatives were also
established.

61

Digital route monitoring allows us to plan our routes optimally and to reduce our energy consumption and environmental impact. The various measures we are undertaking
in this context play a major role in Strategy 2023. For
example, we minimise the disturbance of marine mammals
in protected areas with specific speed profiles, and reduce
fuel consumption by monitoring fouling digitally (see Partnerships for protection of the marine environment, p. 78
and Efficient use of energy, p. 69 et seq.). — NfR
We increase planning reliability for us and our customers
through Voyage Control, a central unit that manages decisions affecting scheduling. Customer satisfaction will be
increased significantly since there will be fewer short-term
and unexpected changes. For Hapag-Lloyd, this process
will also lead to more efficient processes, cost savings and
a reduction in energy consumption. — NfR
In 2019, we also launched a tool for early identification
of berth occupancy conflicts, which enables ships in the
entire fleet and even our partners to react proactively to
occupied berths – for instance, by reducing their speed.
— NfR

DIGITAL SOLUTIONS IN SHIP OPERATIONS
We created the Fleet Support Center (FSC) department
for digital solutions in ship operations in 2013. The FSC
works continually towards improving the quality of avail­
able data. This is the case with cargo stowage planning,
i.e. the strategic planning of ship loading, as well as speed
and trim management at sea. — NfR
A software solution continually records fuel-related data,
such as quality, bunker supplies, daily consumption,
time of fuel conversion on journeys in protected areas
and event-related information, such as arrival, departure,
waiting times at sea and bunker processes. The use of
this tool enables us to guarantee standardised reporting
for the entire fleet. — NfR

Developments towards digitalisation of the industry will
continue to occupy us in the future. As an organisation,
Hapag-Lloyd will work in a more agile and automated way
and will increasingly offer the customer digital solutions.

INTERVIEW WITH
JAN BOVERMANN

© HHLA

Digitally successful:
with innovative
ideas for the benefit
of the customers

Jan Bovermann, Head of Corporate Development at Hamburger
Hafen und Logistik AG, is responsible for the company’s digital transformation. The essence of this is the development and implementation of the digitalisation strategy in close accord with the corporate
strategy.

How do you yourself define digitalisation?
Does HHLA have overall objectives?
I see digital transformation as an opportunity to adapt
business processes, business areas and business practices in such a way that the company is able to compete
successfully in an increasingly digitalised environment.
The aims are clear: customer-oriented continued development of the company, optimisation of operational and
administrative business processes, and development of
employees so they can master future challenges.

What challenges are there with regard to digitalisation in the shipping industry? What are
the factors for success in these projects?
Employee acceptance and openness towards innovative
technical ideas is the basis for approaching almost all
digital challenges. The integration of employees in digitalisation projects is a major factor for success. Furthermore,
it is important to have a good ecosystem, a network
of “like-minded companies” that have a similarly open
attitude towards networking and end-to-end customer
focus. This results in motivation to innovate and willingness to implement changes.
Which project are you working on at the
moment, and where might there be overlaps
with the future activities of Hapag-Lloyd?
We are working on a whole series of projects in all areas
which we believe will make HHLA even more competitive in the future. This includes projects to optimise our
operational processes by means of artificial intelligence,
customer loyalty programmes – which are measures
that generate added value for customers – and finally,
projects which will open up new sectors for HHLA. Since
Hapag-Lloyd is a major client and partner for HHLA, and
we are both part of complex supply chains in the sense
of our end-to-end customer approach, this of course
results in shared opportunities, and thus overlaps.

63

To what extent can digitalisation help reduce
environmental impacts and increase customer
satisfaction?
The customer-oriented approach anchors our digitalisation
strategy. This means that customer satisfaction is always
the focus of new digitalisation projects. At the same time,
digitalisation is also a highly effective means of making a
supply chain more environmentally friendly or even climate
neutral. For example, the use of innovative technologies
may make it possible to reduce CO2 emissions within the
transport chain. One example: HHLA already uses artificial intelligence to optimise container movements in our
container block storage areas. If we can reduce crane
movements through better planning, this reduces energy
consumption, which in turn has a positive effect on the
environment.

Container movements are reduced using
artificial intelligence.

Digital technologies make port logistics
even more efficient and easier to plan.

Data protection
and digital security
The protection of personal and commercial data will
­b ecome ever more important with the increased use
of digital solutions. Not only do strict laws and ­d igital
threats have an influence on our work; customers
and employees also increasingly expect reliable data
­m anagement with a high level of protection. As a result,
we make a particular effort to protect our IT systems
on land and at sea as effectively as possible. — NfR — 418/103

STANDARDS FOR THE PROTECTION OF
DATA AND IT SYSTEMS

systems. This allows us to generally remedy identified
security flaws during normal operations. — NfR

Due to our high technical and process-related standards,
we guarantee the security of IT and the often sensitive
data entrusted to us. These standards enable us to
comply with the relevant laws and meet our customers’
specific requirements, such as those placed on us by the
Compliance and Legal departments of major customers
as a result of the introduction of the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR). — NfR

As a result of our high transport volume, Hapag-Lloyd is
also subject to the requirements following from the European regulatory framework for the protection of critical
infrastructures. — NfR

In general, Hapag-Lloyd has observed a global tendency
to introduce or tighten data protection regulations. Many
states base their policies on the EU’s GDPR, such as
the state of California on introducing the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) on 1 January 2020. Because
Hapag-Lloyd complies with the high requirements of
GDPR as a minimum standard throughout the Group,
in many cases we already comply with the new legal
requirements. We also take the relevant standards into
account at new sites. In Asia, we are also observing a
trend towards stricter control of personal data and key
business-related data. — NfR
New IT threats also continuously confront our work;
we must protect ourselves and our customers against
them. In doing so, we rely on the ongoing training of
our employees and the monitoring of our technical

One major step in 2019 was the establishment of an
ISO 27001-compliant information security management
system for our systems on land. We received the relevant
external certification for this. As part of the certification
process, a vulnerability scan service was set up in core
systems for the identification and elimination of vulnerabilities in networks. The goal is to identify potential
vulnerabilities so that appropriate action can be taken.
Furthermore, a cybersecurity incident response plan was
developed and will be reviewed regularly. — NfR

ORGANISATIONAL INTEGRATION OF
IT SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION
At Hapag-Lloyd, responsibility for data protection and
data security lies with the individual business units worldwide. The Corporate Data Protection Office (CDPO)
advises the central departments, regions and areas about
compliance with data privacy legislation. To this end,
each region and area has its own data protection officer

International Association of Classification Societies, which
will establish minimum technical standards in the shipping
industry. This means cybersecurity will continue to gain
relevance as a ship-related security topic. — NfR
Through the Digital Container Shipping Association, we
are now championing the harmonisation of these standards to create an industry-wide framework in order to
meet the challenges posed by cybersecurity.

or coordinator who implements all legal requirements,
coordinates measures with the CDPO if necessary, and
acts as a contact person. — NfR
An IT security team monitors and improves our central
IT systems on land, and deals with security issues. By
engaging in discussions with external security experts, the
team is always up-to-date on the latest risks and developments. — NfR
For our own ships, IT security at sea is coordinated by the
central Maritime IT Security department and implemented
by regional Fleet Management. The safeguarding of IT
security on charter ships is contractually regulated with
the relevant service providers.

SECURITY OF THE FLEET’S IT-BASED
­O PERATIONAL SYSTEMS
The security of IT systems on ships is gaining significance
due to the digitalisation of our processes. The European
Commission’s Network and Information Security directive
(NIS Directive), which came into force in 2019, subjects us
to higher requirements regarding the regulation of critical
infrastructures. We are particularly required to take action
in terms of reporting and collaboration with public entities
on IT security. — NfR
External requirements for IT security on ships include
changes to the International Safety Management (ISM)
Code, which is valid as of 2021, and a cybersecurity
clause to be added to the classification programme of the

The security of on-board IT and networks and an appraisal
of associated challenges such as the lack of broadband
connections are becoming increasingly important in the
shipping industry. Nonetheless, we believe a ship should
be able to operate without IT support in an emergency.
The operational systems of our fleet are not yet connected
with the systems which are essential for ship operation
and Hapag-Lloyd’s IT. As a result, they are not at risk of
cyberattacks, and we monitor their security separately.
However, new acquisitions that have technical external
access capability are associated with these kinds of risks,
so that we will have to take preventive security measures
in the future. — NfR
For this reason, numerous measures were implemented
during the reporting period, starting with ships registered
under the German flag. The previously strict separation
between business IT systems on land and operational
IT on board will gradually be abolished, and the systems
will be planned and implemented together in the future.
A suitable IT platform for ships registered under the German flag is currently implemented. In order to address
challenges and risks of cyberattacks, a process is simultaneously being established to safeguard IT security at sea
and to respond to new reporting requirements. This will be
implemented by 2021. Existing IT security standards will
be harmonised in the coming months and will be applied
to our fleet in future. — NfR
In preparation for the new requirements of the ISM code
which will be valid from 2021 (see Safe ship operations,
p. 53 et seq.), in 2019 we carried out external audits of
IT and OT security on board in Hamburg and Dubai. As a
result of these audits, measures for improvement continue
to be implemented. — NfR

DATA AND INFORMATION TRAINING
We place great value on ensuring that our employees
throughout the company are familiar with the responsible
and legally compliant handling of information and data.
We have used a blended learning concept to train our
shore-based personnel since 2018. This combines several
training types such as Web-based and on-site training,
and is supplemented with course content and news on
the intranet. We thereby pursue the high standard of providing insight that goes far beyond the minimum required
under data protection law. Our experiences with the new
concept so far have been very positive. — NfR
Our data protection experts also train our shore-based
personnel in changes in the law and new employee hires.
Departments that handle sensitive data receive training
from us on specific issues as part of risk-oriented corporate management. We used on-site training events in
2019 to train various HR departments worldwide on the
GDPR and employee data; Sales and Customer Service
were also trained. Furthermore, we developed a user
awareness programme for phishing emails, which is to
be implemented in 2020. As part of the actions required
for the ISO 27001 certification of our information security
management system, we are currently developing an
interactive training concept that must be completed in the
event of repeated cases of misconduct. — NfR

The marine personnel on board our ships under the German flag are also trained and made aware of IT security
and data protection. By way of example, we implemented
an awareness campaign in 2019 that included mandatory
training on board and communication measures such
as posters. We cannot carry out Web-based training at
sea for technical reasons; our officers provide instruction
instead. — NfR

DATA PROTECTION ENQUIRIES
We communicate important information regarding data
protection in a transparent way, for example via our data
privacy statement on our website and in our Mobile App.
We also receive specific enquiries from employees and citizens regarding data protection and the processing of their
data by Hapag-Lloyd, including via our whistle-blower
hotline and email (see Compliance, p. 23 et seq.). New
processes, such as a ticketing system, have prepared
us for an increase in data privacy questions so we can
promptly provide detailed information to those concerned.
During the reporting period, employee enquiries regarding
data protection regulations increased in particular, while
we continued to receive relatively few notifications. — NfR
In 2019, there was one reportable IT security incident,
which was classified as insignificant after consultation with
the regulatory authorities. — NfR — 418-1

LEGAL COMPLIANCE WITH LOW-SULPHUR FUELS

Switching to low-sulphur fuels is labour-­

make the changeover on time: as of the end
of 2019, most our fleet already operates on
low-sulphur fuel.

Management
approach

— 302/103, 305/103

As a globally active liner shipping company, we are well
aware of our major responsibility towards the environment. We actively work towards minimising our impact on
the environment and climate as much as possible, both
on land and at sea. We achieve this by means of global
environmental and quality management standards, which
we continuously monitor with audits. — NfR

Our strategy and methods for reducing negative impacts
on the environment are defined in our long-term sustainability policy. This draws on a wide range of environmental
standards and certifications such as the global environmental and quality management standards ISO 9001 and
ISO 14001, which we fulfil both at our sites and on our
own ships (see Sustainability management, p. 12 et seq.).
On the other hand, certification of energy efficiency (EEDI1
certification) and of prevention of oil, water and air pollution
(such as IOPP, ISPP and IAPP2) refer specifically to ships.

modes of propulsion – for example, via our partnership with
the Hapag-Lloyd Center for Shipping and Global Logistics
(CSGL) at Kühne Logistics University, a research center,
and within the context of the Clean Cargo initiative (see
Lowering emissions through active membership, p. 76).
New technologies such as fuel cells cannot currently be
used for propulsion on our ships because the technology
is not yet sufficiently mature.
The EU’s Monitoring, Reporting and Verification Regulation
(MRV) was launched in 2018. This concerns the reporting
of CO2 emissions and fuel for ships of over 5,000 gross
tonnage that call at European ports. The IMO’s data
collection system (DCS), which prescribes the reporting of
this data on a global level, was launched in 2019. HapagLloyd naturally fulfils the requirements of both regulations.

Climate protection
and reduction
of emissions
As a liner shipping company, we are able to apply the
greatest leverage for effective climate protection ­s trategy
in our fleet operations. The reduction of greenhouse
gases is one of our most important goals. We want to
do this in part by increasing energy efficiency, introducing strict requirements for newbuilds and taking measures
to reduce bunker consumption. — NfR — 102-11

EFFICIENT USE OF ENERGY
— 302/103, 305/103, 307/103

We aim to achieve the highest possible transport capacity
with the lowest possible energy consumption. In doing
so, we will comply with all applicable regulations, even
though the increasing requirements are challenging for us
both technologically and financially. Having said this, we
see each new requirement as an opportunity to reinforce
our contribution to the protection of the environment and
people, and to reduce the negative effects on the environment. Moreover, Hapag-Lloyd is committed to ensuring
that the regulations are equally binding for all companies.
— NfR

We regularly invest in measures to maintain and increase
the efficiency of our ships. This enables our ships to
achieve a long service life of up to 25 years and has a
long-term positive effect on the environment and our
competitiveness. — NfR
Specifications for newbuilds and modernisations
When building new ships or modernising existing vessels,
we develop designs according to the latest technological efficiency and environmental standards. We monitor
the success of our measures using the Energy Efficiency
Design Index (EEDI). This index expresses the relationship
of the engine output, specific fuel consumption and CO2
factor with the capacity and speed of the ship. — NfR

69

Hapag-Lloyd wants to
reduce its specific CO2
emissions per TEU-kilometre by 20% by 2020
(base year: 2016). Fleet
Management continually
aims to reduce bunker
consumption, in part by
taking measures to minimise water resistance.

In 2017, due to the installation of the latest technologies,
the EEDI rating of the five new ships was around 40% to
60% below the IMO reference line for similar ships. No
new ships went into service in 2018 or 2019. — NfR
A remeasurement according to EEDI requires the relevant
ships to be out of service for several weeks. We therefore
forego a remeasurement following the modernisation of
a ship, though this would likely lead to much improved
EEDI ratings.

Energy use in fleet operations — 302-4
Fuel consumption is an important starting point when it
comes to the continual reduction of energy use in ship
operations. In our Safety Management Manual (SMM) and
Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP), we
have set clear guidelines to keep our bunker consumption
as low as possible. We continuously monitor adherence to
the guidelines and immediately inform our seafaring staff
in writing of any changes. In 2019, we trained our Board
Management team in fleet monitoring, speed regulation,
trim optimisation and reporting as part of an information
campaign to improve energy efficiency on our ships registered under the German flag. — NfR
The ongoing monitoring of data from ship operations
makes it possible for us to identify unused potential in the
utilisation rate of the ships with regard to carrying capacity (see Digital solutions in ship operations, p. 61). The
greater the utilisation of the ship space, the more efficient
the energy use. — NfR
Our specific bunker consumption for the entire fleet per
slot decreased from 2.75 tonnes in 2018 to 2.59 tonnes4
in 2019. — NfR — 302/3
Energy efficiency can be further increased by reducing
water resistance. To this end, we optimise the hydro­
dynamic design of the bulbous bow and propellers on
our ships. Ship-specific biofouling management plans
are drawn up to prevent fouling on ship hulls. By means
of a new digital solution, we can quickly initiate changes
in water resistance that stem from fouling and quickly
remove it. We were able to save around 9% on energy
in the form of fuel, only by removing the fouling on the
affected ships. Correspondingly, cleaning of 33 ships took
place during the reporting period. — NfR

a weighted monthly average of all ships operated for us in 2019.

2.59 t

of bunker consumption
per slot (in terms of the average annual container TEU capacities on a weighted monthly average of all ships operated for us
in 2019) — NfR

In 2019, the absolute bunker consumption (distillates
and residual oils) for the entire fleet was around 4.38 million tonnes (2018: around 4.40 million tonnes). 16% of
total consumption (2018: 13%) consisted of low-sulphur
bunker fuels (MFO5 low sulphur and MDO6). — NfR — 302-1
In order to reduce emissions and our energy consumption, we also consider the lowest possible environmental
impact when procuring goods and services. One means
of doing this is by using energy-saving reefer containers
(see Sustainable procurement, p. 82 et seq.).
Energy supply while ships are docked
Traditionally, docked ships use fuel known as “auxiliary
diesel” to cover their energy requirements. However, fuel
combustion pollutes the air in the port with direct emissions, for which reason onshore power is increasingly
being used instead. Having said this, in many ports it is
not possible to supply ships with onshore power while
they are docked because neither the ships nor the ports
have the requisite technical requirements.
We continually see how requirements are changing in
ports that are relevant to us: for example, in Californian
ports, 80% of electricity must be covered by onshore
power starting in 2020, with this figure likely to rise to
100% by 2021. In China, an increasing number of ports
are also being equipped with the necessary technical
infrastructure for the supply of onshore power. For ships
with the relevant infrastructure that call at these ports,
the use of onshore power has been mandatory since July
2019. —­NfR

5 MFO = Marine Fuel Oil
6 MDO = Marine Diesel Oil

71

In order to comply with more stringent legal requirements
around the globe, we are successively retrofitting our
ships on specific routes with onshore power connections. During the reporting period, one ship in our fleet
was fully converted for onshore power. The retrofitting of
two more ships has also begun. Currently, eleven of our
41 ships registered under the German flag and eight of
our 127 charter ships can now connect to onshore power
and are used on routes calling at Californian ports. — NfR
Hapag-Lloyd is testing other options to make the power
supply to docked ships more environmentally friendly.
One option are PowerPacs, i.e. containers that hold
gas-powered generators and a tank of LNG. While
berthed, the containers supply the ship with electricity,
which means fuel combustion can be avoided. This
results in far fewer emissions. We first tested the technology in the Port of Hamburg in 2018. In October 2019,
we carried out another test with a double PowerPac,
which resulted in double the output. In the next step, an
operational and commercial evaluation of the test will be
carried out in conjunction with our project partners.

Energy use at our sites
We set ourselves site-specific targets throughout the
world to reduce our energy use and emissions, since
energy use is managed locally. These goals include the
reduction of absolute or specific energy consumption at
sites. At our headquarters at Ballindamm in Hamburg,
100% of our electricity comes from renewable energy
sources. — NfR — 302-1

CUTTING EMISSIONS — 305/103
Bunker consumption and quality have the biggest influence on our emissions. This is where we make concerted
efforts to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases and
other air pollutants. — NfR
In addition to concrete optimisation measures on board
our ships, we also take part in voluntary environment
protection programmes in various ports. For instance, all
of our ships are registered in the Environmental Ship Index
(ESI), which evaluates a ship’s environmental impact with
particular regard to its emissions. Ships with an ESI score
that is much higher than the one specified by the local
port authorities benefit from reduced port charges.

Greenhouse gas emissions
Since 2008, we have cut our specific CO2 emissions by
around 50%8. This was only possible through the implementation of numerous measures such as the use of
larger, more efficient ships, improved water resistance,

the introduction of digital solutions, improved routing, and
planning along the entire transport chain. Measures for
more efficient use of container slots on board also had a
positive effect on reducing specific CO2 emissions. We
want to ensure that this trend continues. We continue to
get closer to our target of reducing specific CO2 emissions
per TEU-kilometre by 20% by 2020 (base year 2016):
compared to 2016, we were able to achieve a reduction of
around 17%9. — NfR — 305-4

of CO2 emissions

in total (based on fleet bunker consumption) — NfR — 305-1

Air pollutants
In addition to reducing greenhouse gases, our goal is to
reduce air pollutants and comply with legal requirements.
The combustion of fuel on board our ships releases air
pollutants, primarily nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur
oxides (SOx). In 2019, we received lab analyses of around
99% of our fuel delivery in order to determine its sulphur
content. During the reporting period, our fuel had an
average weighted sulphur content of 1.95% (previous
year: 2.26%). This put our levels below those specified by
the IMO threshold of 3.5% that was valid until 31 December 2019 for marine areas outside emission control areas
(ECAs). — NfR
Special statutory regulations on fuel quality apply to many
of these special protection zones in order to improve air
quality in coastal areas. In China, for example, a law on
the use of low-sulphur fuels was introduced in 2019 –
­similar to the ones in the USA, Canada, Baltic and North
Sea regions. In the future, there might be similar specifications for the Mediterranean. — NfR

The new IMO requirements come into force on 1 January
2020. These requirements prohibit the use of bunker with
a sulphur content of more than 0.5% (heavy fuel oil, HFO)
– unless exhaust gas cleaning systems known as scrubbers are used. — NfR
We are able to comply with the new requirements in
various ways: by acquiring compliant bunkers with low
sulphur content, retrofitting ships for operation with LNG
– which is not possible for all ships – and retrofitting ships
with exhaust gas cleaning systems. — NfR

73

To ensure smooth conversion of bunker for our entire fleet
in a timely manner, we set up an internal IMO 2020 working group with representatives from all relevant departments during the reporting period. The working group
was tasked with considering operational requirements and
financial aspects as well as ensuring the lowest possible
degree of disruption to daily operations. To do this, we
analysed potential challenges associated with the conversion in advance. These include appropriate communication with the fleet managements; early initiation of conversion measures due to long ship transit times; release
of necessary capacities; additional costs for discharge of
non-compliant fuel; and tank cleaning. On this basis, we
developed a road map for the conversion that integrates
all fleet managements and carried out ship-specific implementation plans (SIPs) with all relevant departments. The
actual conversion of the entire fleet to the procurement
and use of compliant bunkers took place as planned in
late 2019. — NfR
We also scheduled ten ships to be retrofitted with exhaust
gas cleaning systems; four had already been completed
by the end of 2019. An evaluation of the retrofitting measures will take place during ship operations in 2020. — NfR

INTERVIEW WITH
LARS ROBERT PEDERSEN

Global harmonisation:
Uniform standards for
climate protection

the necessary in-house capabilities, because they don’t
have a large legal team or experts on a variety of operational issues.

As Deputy Secretary General of BIMCO – the world’s largest international shipping organisation - Lars Robert Pedersen is responsible for
the NGO’s efforts to advance its members’ agenda in the regulatory,
technical and security areas particularly in relation to the environmental aspects. He has an engineering background from Maersk, and
been one of BIMCO’s representatives at the sessions of the International Maritime Organization since 2010, working on all the issues
relating to emissions and ballast water treatment, to name a few.

How would you describe the purpose of
BIMCO?
BIMCO is an international shipping organization, which
acts as an independent association of shipowners,
shipping companies, shipbrokers, shipping agencies
and numerous other shipping stakeholders. We aim
to improve standards and harmonise rules and laws in
maritime shipping and put an effort into being a trusted
partner and independent expert. Our more than 50
employees provide a lot of practical advice to our members – also to the smaller members which might not have

What are the challenges in the field of environmental law and regulations?
We are making progress as an industry but I think there
is still a long way to go. The challenge is to get all relevant stakeholders on board despite very different circumstances all around the world. It’s a challenge to be
sufficiently progressive but at the same time bringing
everyone along in order to comply with the environmental
laws. However, this is an essential prerequisite for such an
international industry. We see this for example in the case
of not throwing plastic over board. This has been a rule in
shipping all the way back to the seventies. Naturally, these
regulations have to be embraced by the companies themselves, it must be both company policy and culture, and
ultimately it all boils down to the actions of every single
individual involved.
Are there any mid-term goals for the environmental aspects within the next few years?
We believe that mandatory requirements for hull cleaning in regard to biofouling will be the next point on the
agenda. This is why we at BIMCO took the initiative to
develop an international standard for hull cleaning and
with that a certification screening for hull cleaners to
ensure a certain quality throughout the whole process. To
avoid local individual solutions which may be incompatible, or even conflicting, we want to move into a global
process at IMO and establish worldwide standards.

75

How do you rate Hapag-Lloyd’s recent efforts?
What do you think about IMO’s long-term
goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?
We are very happy to have Hapag-Lloyd as an active
member in our committees. I know about your project to
retrofit a vessel to LNG propulsion. Such a commitment
is needed in our initiatives and a step in the right direction. Of course, there are technological developments
and these decisions could be different in 10 years’ time.
Counteracting climate change in the long-term can only
be achieved by avoiding emissions from fossil fuels.
The IMO has made its position clear by setting a goal to
halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We believe a
lot of research and development is needed to achieve
this goal. Therefore, we propose to set up an R&D fund
together with the World Shipping Council, among others,
to drive technological developments in the right direction.
­Hapag-Lloyd is a welcome partner in this drive!

Lowering emissions through active membership
— 102-12, 102-13

Hapag-Lloyd has been a member of the Clean Cargo
initiative for over ten years. Clean Cargo is a global business-to-business initiative representing large shipping
companies, global traders and producers in order to promote responsible shipping through standardised reporting.
The shipping companies represented in the Clean Cargo
initiative account for around 80%10 of the global container
cargo capacity. In an annual report published by the Clean
Cargo initiative, we communicate our progress with the
reduction of our specific greenhouse gas emissions. — NfR
We continue to be a member of the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) and the EcoTransIT World Initiative
(EWI), an independent platform for transport companies,
shipping agents and logistics service providers. In both
of these initiatives, we are helping to create transparent
evaluation criteria for the industry’s impact on the environment, such as uniform calculation standards for emissions. — NfR
We support the objectives of the International Chamber
of Shipping (ICS) as well as of the World Shipping Council
(WSC) and the Baltic and International Maritime Council
(BIMCO) for the reduction of CO2 emissions in current
negotiations with the IMO and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We also
support the relevant aims in the environmental committees
of the European Community Shipowners’ Association.

content, the forum discusses many other topics with a
view to improving the environmental impacts of commercial shipping. — NfR
Our customers can obtain information about the various
emissions in their transport chain using the Hapag-Lloyd
EcoCalc free of charge. The emissions are ­calculated
based on data from the Clean Cargo Initiative and
­EcoTransIT World.
Awards
Our environmental action received several awards once
again in 2019. In October 2019, Hapag-Lloyd received
an award in the Green Shipping category at the Maritime Standards Award in Dubai for the conversion of its
container ship “Sajir” to LNG propulsion. With this prize,
the jury acknowledged our “trailblazing” contribution to
environmentally friendly shipping and the improvement of
environmental protection. In order to carry out the necessary conversions, the 15,000 TEU ship will probably enter
the yard for a period of about 100 days in the second half
of 2020.
Hapag-Lloyd received a gold and a silver award in 2018
as part of the Protecting Blue Whales and Blue Skies
initiative for its speed reduction in Californian waters. We
managed to continue improving our performance in 2019
and were placed in the best category, “Sapphire”. The
prize is expected to be awarded in spring 2020 (see Partnerships for protection of the marine environment, p. 78).

— NfR

As a member of the Trident Alliance and a participant in
political forums, we campaign to ensure that the IMO’s
decision to restrict sulphur content to 0.5% from 2020
and the ban on non-compliant bunkers are adhered to
throughout the industry. We develop measures for global
implementation on various expert panels11. — NfR
Hapag-Lloyd is active in two working groups in the

rating from DHL Global Forwarding (DGF). The evaluation
was made in recognition of our activities in the categories
of sustainability management, transparency, CO2 efficiency
and sustainable innovation and development.

We are conscious of the impact we have on maritime
ecosystems. Our aim is to protect life under water
and on land to the best of our ability. In order to live
up to our responsibility, we draw on a wide range of
measures. — NfR — 102-11
PROTECTION OF THE SEA AND MARINE
BIODIVERSITY — 304-2, 307-1
Our business activities have an impact on marine biodiversity in a variety of ways. These include the emission of air
pollutants, greenhouse gases and noise, and the disturbance of marine mammals. The main areas affected are
along our routes and in the ports. We are actively working on restricting these environmental impacts through
specific measures and our cooperation with industry
members, authorities and NGOs. Our goal is to protect
the waters we navigate and to comply with international
regulations on water protection. — NfR
We have implemented global water protection management systems which we review regularly. Some criteria
here, for example, are breaches of ballast water guidelines
and the number of substances released which are listed
under the International Convention for the Prevention of
Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). — NfR

77

Hapag-Lloyd takes responsibility for protecting
the waters it navigates
and has implemented water protection
management systems.
Our internal “no garbage
into the sea” policy
serves as a guideline.

During the reporting period, our fleet experienced an oil
leak on board the container ship “Dublin Express”, which
encountered turbulent seas on its journey from Port
Everglades to New York. When discharging the vessel in
New York, damage to the hull was discovered below the
water line at the level of a fuel storage tank. The leak was
sealed that same night. Far-reaching oil barriers were also
set up immediately, specialist companies helped with the
clean-up, and proactive protective measures began for
nearby conservation areas. Hapag-­Lloyd worked together
closely and successfully with the relevant authorities and
affected parties in order to keep the impact on people
and the environment as minimal as possible. — NfR — 306-3
Ballast water — 102-12, 303-2
Marine biodiversity can be affected by the spread of invasive species when ballast water is released. Ballast water
is used to stabilise ships in transit. Like all members of
the industry, Hapag-Lloyd complies with stringent global
legal requirements regarding ballast water management.
Incidents of this kind are therefore highly unlikely. — NfR
One of the most important regulatory frameworks is
the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) Ballast
Water Management Convention. Its goal is to prevent the
spread of invasive species via ballast water. Implementation of a specific ballast water management plan is mandatory. The entire fleet meets this requirement in full. In
addition, a ballast water treatment system to purify ballast
water must be installed on every ship within a mandatory
time period of a maximum of seven years. — NfR

78

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 9

The regulations of the US Coast Guard (USCG) for the
protection of American waters are much more stringent.
Currently, only 24 systems for ballast water treatment fulfil
these high requirements worldwide, so that in individual
cases, temporary exemptions must sometimes be made.
We have had our existing systems approved temporarily as an alternative management system by the USCG.
However, during the reporting period we continued to
retrofit our ships in order to meet the requirements of the
USCG in good time. — NfR
Partnerships for protection of the marine
­environment — 102-12, 102-13, 102-44, 304-2, 304-4
Through our membership of the World Shipping Council (WSC), we are committed to establishing the traffic
separation scheme off Sri Lanka’s southern coast in
order to protect blue whales on their migration routes. In
November 2019, we supported an International Maritime
Organization (IMO) delegation in their tour of the embassy
responsible for this project in Sri Lanka. We also continued our participation in whale protection programmes in
the Santa Barbara Channel (USA) and the Echo Program
in the Haro Strait (USA/Canada). The projects are being
scientifically supported by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
For the third year in a row, we are participating in the
Protecting Blue Whales and Blue Skies programme
which champions the reduction of air pollution around
the Californian coast in order to protect endangered
blue whales. By reducing the speed during their feeding
season from July to November in the San Francisco Bay
and Santa Barbara Channel, we can minimise both the
emission of air pollutants and collisions with whales. 84%
of the entire distance Hapag-Lloyd travelled in the San
Francisco Bay and the Santa Barbara Channel in 2019
was covered at ten knots or less. For this, we received
the highest award, in the “Sapphire” category, together
with only one other shipping company out of 15 total
participants. Our digital route monitoring system enables
us to use special speed profiles for protected areas so
we can guarantee our compliance with reduced speed
limits. In addition to the positive environmental effects,

the ten-knot target allows us to operate ships with an
efficient operating load and save on fuel costs. ­— 305/103
During the reporting period, we also voluntarily participated in the EcoAction Program in Vancouver (Canada),
the Voluntary Vessel Speed Reduction Program in Los
Angeles (USA) and the Green Flag Incentive Program in
Long Beach (USA) to contribute to the reduction of our
environmental impacts.
In October 2019, Hapag-Lloyd was one of the first signatories of the Arctic Shipping Corporate Pledge created by
the Nike sportswear manufacturer and the Ocean Conservancy environmental organisation. With this voluntary
commitment, we underline our particular responsibility for
the oceans, and pledge to avoid the use of Arctic shipping routes so long as serious negative impacts on its
unique ecosystem cannot be ruled out. At Hapag-Lloyd,
this topic has accompanied Fleet Management for
many years within the framework of a technical nautical
risk analysis. It involved participation in the EU-funded
ACCESS project (Arctic Climate Change Economy and
Society), which has now been concluded.
We have been engaged in dialogue with the non-governmental organisations OceanCare and WWF Hong Kong
since 2017 and have decided to ban the global transport
of a number of controversial goods such as whale and
dolphin meat, shark fins, turtles and hunting trophies.
Since the transportation of these goods has not yet been
internationally regulated, we have added them to an
exclusion list. In doing so, we want to make a long-term
contribution to the protection of endangered species and
to maintaining biodiversity. We ensure implementation
of these transport restrictions through our Cargo Patrol
programme (see Dangerous goods, p. 57 et seq.).

RECYCLING AND WASTE DISPOSAL
— 102-16, 301/103, 306/103

Recycling ships and containers
If we take a ship out of service, we do not automatically
relinquish our responsibility for the protection of people
and the environment. Thus, in 2018, we updated our
Hapag-Lloyd Ship Recycling Policy with an Inventory of
Hazardous Materials (IHM) in line with applicable EU law.
It highlights our objective of minimising the effects on
society and the environment when it comes to recycling
our ships as well. With an IHM, hazardous materials can
be specifically identified when preparing a scrapping plan
and measures adopted to protect shipyard personnel.
Additionally, an environmentally friendly waste management strategy is planned and implemented as part of the
IHM. Each newly built ship at Hapag-Lloyd is therefore
equipped with a mandatory IHM.
We did not recycle any of our ships in 2019. If a ship is
to be recycled, we strive to select shipyards that fulfil
the requirements of the EU’s Ship Recycling Regulation
(SRR). However, most of these shipyards lack sufficient
capacity. We approach these challenges in partnership
with the European Community Shipowners’ Associations
(ECSA) and also search for suitable partners outside
of the EU. A shipyard that complies with the EU’s SRR

79

should also implement the guidelines of the Hong Kong
International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally
Sound Recycling of Ships, which was ratified by Germany as well in 2019.
Hapag-Lloyd is also a founding member of the Ship
Recycling Transparency Initiative (SRTI), which was
founded in 2018 by shipping companies, banks, shipowners and charities. Its aim is to increase industry
transparency with regard to the environmentally friendly
recycling of ships under safe working conditions. Hapag-­
Lloyd is involved in increasing the initiative’s sphere of
influence and, as such, plays an active role on its steering committee. Additional members of the SRTI were
acquired during the reporting period.
Hapag-Lloyd’s commitment to responsible ship recycling
was awarded with the DNV GL’s Excellence Green Star
Award in 2018 following an independent assessment. As
part of the certification process, an external organisation
reviewed our recycling processes.
If containers are no longer suitable for transporting cargo
by sea, they are repurposed if possible – for instance, for
the stationary storage of goods. We currently only recycle
containers in exceptional circumstances and in compliance with local regulations.

Waste disposal
Preventing waste from entering the world’s oceans has
been a major topic for the shipping industry for decades
The MARPOL agreement on the prevention of marine pollution by ships came into force in 1973 and has continued
to evolve. This agreement stipulates, for example, how
ships are to handle oil, hazardous liquids, waste water and
other waste.
Hapag-Lloyd’s “No garbage into the sea” policy has also
been put into practice for decades. All waste on board
is collected, separated and deposited at the relevant
ports for proper disposal in line with local environmental
regulations.
Our sites around the world are working towards avoiding
waste wherever possible; they do this for example by
installing drinking water fountains in some of the Areas
and in the Hamburg headquarters, and by providing
recyclable glass bottles in conference rooms. By using
reusable cups at many sites, we are also reducing our
consumption of disposables. We also raise awareness

among our employees about careful use of resources and
waste avoidance. At the same time, we strengthen their
acceptance of these topics. This allows us to implement
our measures more successfully and achieve significantly
better results.
In our regional headquarters in the Region Middle East for
example, we have promoted the use of reusable cups via
our “Choose to reuse” campaign. With success: within
one year, 58% fewer paper cups were used. During the
reporting period, we also advocated the replacement of
plastic bottles with recyclable glass bottles via our follow-up “Say no to plastic” campaign. This resulted in 92%
fewer plastic bottles being bought than in the previous
year. At our Global Service Center in India, we replaced
all plastic water bottles with stainless steel as part of our
“No plastic” initiative. We encourage sellers of plastic
water dispenser bottles to ensure they are disposed of in
an environmentally friendly way and to check whether this
can be certified by the relevant authorities.

Sustainable
procurement

­— 102-9

In the course of our business activities, we source various goods and services from suppliers worldwide. Due
to the significant financial and material scope of these
goods and services, professional procurement management is a major factor in Hapag-Lloyd’s success.
MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Hapag-Lloyd procures a wide range of goods and services. The goods procured range from office materials
and replacement parts for ships to containers, bunker
and container ships. The portfolio of services includes
shipments, terminal handling and maintenance, as well as
training and consultancy services. The diversified procurement portfolio with its high technical and qualitative standards, and the differing market structures for our global
needs, affect the complexity of our procurement activities.
In 2019, truck capacity shortages in some countries were
the biggest challenge facing Procurement. However, we
were able to minimise the associated negative effects on
Hapag-Lloyd and its partners through targeted market
research and cooperative negotiations.

With every purchase, we consider prevailing demand
and market structures, as well as availability, quality
and prices. We focus in particular on the prevailing legal
requirements. The agreements with our partners in THE
Alliance influence our purchasing decisions. Advantages
and disadvantages for all partners must be analysed and
considered in the decision-making process.
In 2019, we procured goods and services worth
EUR 11,373 million (2018: EUR 10,525 million). The
purchasing volume increased during the reporting period,
partly due to the increase in transport volume and higher
expenses for chartering. The increase was partially compensated for through various cost-cutting programmes.

Procurement organisation
We manage our procurement activities optimally through
our central Global Procurement organisation. It is responsible for harmonising our global procurement processes
and for training Procurement staff in modern procurement
methods and systems.
Under the functional management of Global Procurement,
the regions and areas are also responsible for elements
of procurement. The managers responsible are provided
with strategic and methodological support and actively
assisted with the implementation of measures.
As a result of the standardised global processes and systems that we combine with our regional knowledge of the
markets and their requirements, we ensure that we can
make optimal procurement decisions.
Global Procurement is currently working together with
local procurement units with the aim of further improving
the cost structure and thus the competitiveness of Hapag-Lloyd. Furthermore, our expertise in procurement is to
be strengthened in order to manage the relationships with
suppliers even more sustainably.

When concluding a framework agreement with
­Hapag-Lloyd, our business partners are obliged to sign
our supplier code of conduct. This code of conduct
covers aspects such as the environment, employee rights,
compliance with human rights and combating corruption
and bribery. Business partners have two options: either
they can subscribe to the content of Hapag-Lloyd’s supplier code of conduct or they can confirm that they possess their own code of conduct which is consistent with
our values. However, we do not have this kind of contractual relationship with all our suppliers. As a result, around
70% of suppliers, accounting for 95% of our procurement
volume1, signed the code of conduct in 2019.

Sustainable supplier management
— 307-1, 308/103, 308-2, 414/103, 414-2

Key elements of our sustainable supplier management
system are our procurement guidelines, sustainability policy, and the quality and environmental management (QEM)
manual. In the course of developing our procurement
organisation, we are revising the procurement guidelines
and introducing comprehensive revised and new guidelines that take local requirements into account. Our QEM
manual establishes a standardised global approach for
qualifying and assessing suppliers in terms of quality and
environmental protection. This enables us to create a
consistent understanding among our global suppliers of
the basic values of our partnership.
We place great value on trusting and long-lasting relationships with our suppliers. We achieve this through our
structured selection and evaluation process, the development of suppliers, and the consideration of risks in the
supply chain.

Throughout the partnership, our service providers regularly
inform our Procurement team about how they tackle the
environmental and social challenges within their field of
business and distinguish themselves from the competition
in terms of these topics. Port and terminal operators, for
example, report on how they lower the diesel consumption of cranes, produce electricity in a resource-friendly
way or reduce truck waiting times. In order to keep costs
and environmental impacts as low as possible over the
entire life cycle of our services, we consider such topics
as part of a “total cost of ownership” approach when
selecting our suppliers.
Around 200 suppliers with high supply volumes are
obliged to submit a self-assessment and to renew it
every two years. Alternatively, the supplier may choose to
undergo an audit, generally carried out by H
­ apag-Lloyd,
on topics such as quality, compliance, employee
aspects, the use of subcontractors, IT security and
1 Refers to terminal, transport and port in the context of Global Procurement.

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 9

the environment. For all other suppliers, the audits and
self-assessments are optional. In 2019, around 70% of
our suppliers, accounting for 80% of our procurement volume2, submitted a self-assessment or underwent an audit.
Suppliers that fulfil all our requirements are added to our
Approved Supplier List (ASL). If our requirements are not
fulfilled, we make a record of deficiencies and remedial
measures. If suppliers do not implement these measures
satisfactorily, we terminate the contract. In 2019, no significant breaches of our ecological or social standards in our
supplier relationships managed by Global Procurement
were identified. Consequently, no contractual relationships
were terminated as a result of such breaches.
Sometimes there is only a limited number of available
business partners – for example, with rail or terminal
service providers. Reasons for this are primarily the nature
of the regional market and the flexibility of the services

available on the route. Here, the main criterion for making
the decision is whether the particular route can be served
at all.
Global Agora project to promote excellence in
­procurement
As part of the Agora project, we identify and realise
optimisation potential in procurement and review our
procurement processes for efficiency and compliance,
among other things.
The aim of Agora is to lower global transport costs
through international partnerships and to continue professionalising procurement through the clear assignment
of tasks and automated processing. In 2019, we developed and implemented systematic measures. In doing
so, we applied advanced procurement methods and collected valuable experience. We also achieved substantial
financial savings and improved our supply situation.

S U S TA I N A B L E P R O C U R E M E N T | S U P P LY C H A I N A N D C U S T O M E R F O C U S

Agora is already being applied in the regions. Implementation has not yet been completed in Europe. The
majority of our global procurement staff has now been
integrated and trained. Experiences from this project will
influence the future development of our central supplier
management.
More efficient processes in collaboration with our
business partners: terminal partnering
In addition to internal optimisation measures, we are also
working together with our business partners on continually improving processes through our terminal improvement programme. One component of this is terminal
partnering. Here, our employees work with terminal operators to analyse the individual processes before and after
arrival at the port, as well as during handling. This aims to
shorten the time required for the port call and for the use
of terminal services such as container storage. This has
led to time and cost savings in Jebel Ali (Dubai), Colombo
(Sri Lanka) and Singapore since 2018. The terminal partnering programme is currently in the roll-out phase in five
of our now six regions.
Outlook: future development of procurement
Our goal is centrally managed, comprehensive and globally synchronised supplier management. With it, we want
to improve our ability to identify risks in the supply chain
as well as the monitoring and evaluation of contractual
relationships and suppliers. To this end, we are currently
harmonising our procurement processes and developing a global blueprint for organisational structures and
processes in our regions and areas. This procedure is
designed to make our procurement organisation more
transparent and efficient, and to lower costs. We launched
an eProcurement suite in 2019, which will be rolled out
globally in 2020.
With the introduction of the eProcurement suite, we
want to:
–	Define topics such as quality, environmental and risk
management, as well as social aspects, as procurement
criteria and standardise them worldwide
–	Systematically record and evaluate risks in the
supply chain

85

–	Conclude contracts with more suppliers, thus significantly increasing commitment to our supplier code of
conduct
–	Introduce the standard requirement to provide a self-assessment or undergo an audit at the start of a business
relationship
– Improve our partnerships with suppliers.

BUNKER PROCUREMENT
A major proportion of the goods we procure is accounted
for by fuel (known as bunker). When procuring this fuel,
we use strict selection criteria to ensure that we comply
with technical standards and environmental regulations,
without exception.
Bunker includes distillates (MDO/MGO3) and residual oils
(IFO/HFO/VLSFO/ULSFO4), which differ in their heating
values. When procuring fuels, we ensure that they have
the highest possible energy content. This minimises costs
and emissions (see Climate protection and reduction of
emissions, p. 69 et seq.). — NfR
During the course of the year, we received laboratory
­analyses for around 99% of our fuel deliveries and have
procured a total of 4.4 million tonnes (2018: around
4.3 million tonnes) of bunker for the entire fleet, with an
energy content of around 179 million GJ. — NfR
From January 2020, the new threshold for sulphur content
in bunkers will be 0.5%, as specified by the International
Maritime Organization (IMO). In order to ensure that we
comply with the new requirements in a timely manner and
that the conversion is as straightforward as possible, we
set up an internal, interdepartmental IMO 2020 working
group. In keeping with our plans, bunker procured at
the end of the year was largely IMO 2020-compliant (i.e.
VLSFO, ULSFO or Low Sulphur MGO) (see Environmental
and climate protection, p. 67 et seq.). — NfR

3 MDO = Marine Diesel Oil, MGO = Marine Gas Oil

CONTAINER PROCUREMENT
Sustainability standards in container procurement
Depending on the type of cargo, we offer different types of
containers. We distinguish between standard containers,
containers for special cargo and reefer containers. As with
our ships, some of our containers are bought and some
are leased. The containers we buy are primarily manufactured in China in accordance with our specifications and
quality requirements. We select our production locations
based partially on where the containers will later be used,
which helps us to reduce empty legs. We maintain a partnership with the manufacturers of our containers. This can
involve visits by the technical team to the production facilities, particularly in the case of potential suppliers. As with
all major procurements, we require regular, up-to-date
self-assessments from these suppliers. We are currently
launching the process for container leasing.
Container floors — 301/103, 301-1
The floor of a container suffers the most wear during the
course of a transport and therefore needs to be replaced
more frequently. Currently, our containers have four different types of floors: wood, hybrid, bamboo or steel. The
smallest proportion of container floors are made of pure
bamboo, while the majority are hybrid floors combining
the fast-growing raw material of bamboo and wood.
However, we consider this type of floor a bridging technology. They have a shorter lifespan, are relatively heavy,
and are difficult to dispose of due to the necessary use of
processing materials.
We prefer to use our own internally developed containers
with steel floors. These are made almost entirely of steel,
and are for various reasons the best long-term solution
from our point of view. They offer many advantages compared with conventional floors such as greater stability,
lower weight, greater storage space and more security
options for the cargo. Because they are odour-neutral and
easy to clean, they are perfectly suited to transporting
food. They are also more durable and can be recycled
easily in the disposal phase because of their source material. We have determined that customers are satisfied with
steel floors. Some customers, for example in the coffee
industry, specifically request steel floors because of their
odour neutrality.

48,100 TEU
steel floor containers
since 2015

In 2019, we procured 8,000 TEU containers with steel
floors – this corresponds to around 9% of the volume of
new standard containers built during the reporting period.
Since 2015, we have procured around 48,100 TEU with
steel floors – corresponding to around 2% of our container
fleet. This means that we were able to further pursue our
aim to increase the number of steel floor containers in our
fleet in the reporting year.
For standard containers, we currently estimate a useful life
of 13 years, which means that switching to steel containers is a long-term goal. In order to achieve this and cover
future demand, production capacities for steel floors must
increase. With our increasing demand, we aim to motivate
manufacturers to expand their capacity and continue their
investment in production. We are engaging in open discussions with competitors and container leasing companies, and talking to our customers in order to raise awareness of the advantages of steel floors and thus encourage
demand.
More sustainable reefer containers
Many goods are transported in reefer containers. Reefers
are equipped with an electrical unit that can keep the
container at a steady temperature of between –30 °C
and +30 °C. Hapag-Lloyd has a reefer fleet comprising
a total of 206,400 TEU (2018: 185,500 TEU). Their
energy efficiency and environmentally friendly cooling
agents are particularly relevant in terms of their sustainability.
With a view to the strict international laws on the prevention greenhouse gases, such as the Montreal Protocol and
the EU regulation on fluorinated greenhouse gases, we
see the greatest need to take action in terms of selecting
efficient cooling units and the cooling agents used.
We have only been using units with high energy efficiency ratings for many years now. In order to ensure that

S U S TA I N A B L E P R O C U R E M E N T | S U P P LY C H A I N A N D C U S T O M E R F O C U S

classification is independent and robust, we also conduct
our own efficiency tests on most of the models under
specified load conditions. This also includes various
external and simulated operating conditions. The results
of these tests help us to determine the ideal usage
type for each reefer. The average energy consumption
per 40-foot reefer container has decreased in the last
17 years, from 6.8 kWh/unit (2002) to 3.1 kWh/unit in the
reporting year. — NfR

R E E F E R C O N TA I N E R ( I N K W H / U N I T ) — NfR

There is not much potential for further savings. One additional possibility for saving energy is the use of efficiency-enhancing software which can optimise temperature
control, for example. However, its use may pose risks to
the cargo which would be too high considering the low
potential for savings. For this reason, Hapag-Lloyd cannot
currently justify the use of such software.
We also support the development of more environmentally
friendly cooling agents through our cooperation with suppliers of containers and reefer units on new technologies
and alternative cooling agents. This includes long-term
tests of CO2 as a cooling agent.
Another challenge in terms of the sustainability of our
containers is the substitution of the paints used in the
construction of new containers. Here, too, we engage in
dialogue with our stakeholders and support more environmentally friendly alternatives.

INTERVIEW WITH
ANJA RÖNNFELDT

Well documented:
Transparency through
real quality promises

After being employed at a container liner shipping company, Anja
Rönnfeldt joined DB Schenker Regional Office Asia Pacific in 2000
as Trade Manager. She later moved to global ocean freight and took
over as Global Head of Trade Management. As Senior Vice President
Global Ocean Freight, she understands quality as a key criterion
when it comes to selecting suppliers.

With its 2023 strategy, Hapag-Lloyd has set
itself the goal of becoming the number one
with respect to quality. How do you define
good quality? Which aspects of goods transportation do you feel are the most important?
If the customer is satisfied, then you have provided good
quality. For us, it is important that a transport order is
processed as smoothly as possible, which requires proactive dialogue, prompt and accurate documentation, and a
reliable schedule. The end result should be that the loading
of the container is carried out in accordance with the actual
booking confirmation.
At the end of January 2020, Hapag-Lloyd
published three of its ten quality promises and

goals, which address the issues of prompt
and accurate documentation and optimised
document flow. The progress made towards
achieving these goals can be tracked in
a transparent way on the Quality Promise
Dashboard. In your view, how important are
transparency and measurability with respect
to quality?
Transparency and measurability are two important considerations when looking at quality. Certain things can only
be evaluated and improved if you rise to the challenge of
measuring them. Open handling of the status quo, clearly
formulated goals and the fundamental willingness to measure key performance indicators on an ongoing basis and
present this information in a transparent way are all clear
indicators of Hapag-Lloyd’s high quality standards. For us,
this really is great!
What do you believe makes good customer
service? Are there things that Hapag-Lloyd
does particularly well and that should be kept
as they are in future?
DB Schenker regularly carries out carrier surveys. In
the course of these, we use the received information to
evaluate aspects such as sustainability, ethics and compliance. However, another key component of the evaluation
is customer service. This concerns the user-friendliness
of online services as well as the availability of equipment,
billing quality and the proactive provision of information in
the event that a vessel is delayed.
We are delighted that Hapag-Lloyd constantly comes first
in our carrier surveys and has the motivation to become
even better in order to widen the gap between itself and
its closest competitor.

Customer focus
As part of our 2023 strategy, we have reaffirmed our efforts to become the quality leader on the market. We will
achieve this goal by shifting the focus of our activities to
the needs of our approximately 30,600 customers. We
want to offer them even higher quality and more reliable
services around the world. — NfR

REAFFIRMED OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR
QUALITY PROMISE

certification of the quality management team, this aspect
is being awarded even greater significance.

Hapag-Lloyd maintains a diversified customer portfolio
consisting of direct customers and freight forwarders all
over the world. The portfolio consists of customers of various sizes with short, medium and long-term contracts.

Different departments work hand in hand on processing
the orders within the areas and regions in accordance
with globally standardized processes. It is their ambition to improve customer satisfaction over time. The
Sales department is responsible for customer communication until business acquisition. The Customer
Service department deals with booking and the associated communication, while the Operations department
coordinates the transportation of the cargo. — NfR

As a customer-oriented company, we see the satisfaction
and loyalty of our customers as vital to the success of
our long-term business relationships. As a result of the
accountability requirements resulting from the ISO 9001

90

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 9

On the basis of a wide-ranging 2018 market survey as
part of our 2023 strategy, it became clear which quality
characteristics are most important to our customers:
on-time delivery, resolution of customer issues and quick
response to customer enquiries. Based on this information, we defined our Quality Promises in the reporting
period. In early 2020 we published our first three Quality
Promises, which cover quick booking processing, punctual and proper loading, and correct invoicing. We will
gradually introduce the remaining Quality Promises during
the course of the year. We now also have the necessary
infrastructure to be able to continually measure our performance with regard to these Quality Promises and communicate them to our customers on our Quality Promise
webpage. — NfR

RECORDING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
Our greatest challenge is continually increasing customer
satisfaction and loyalty. We regularly conduct surveys in
order to determine how satisfied our customers are. This
also offers us the opportunity to use this feedback in order
to identify areas where we could improve and to leverage
this potential. — NfR
In 2019, two surveys were conducted in March and
October. More than 6,500 customers took part in the
surveys. The Sales and Customer Service departments
in particular are responsible for doing a deep dive on the
results of the customer surveys and for addressing the
feedback through direct customer contact. Initial analyses showed that customer satisfaction has improved and
that our staff have made a major contribution towards

this by responding to and processing customer enquiries
quickly, for example. — NfR
In order to further improve the customer experience, we
have also adjusted our processes, such as for customer-­
focused communication between the Sales and Customer
Service departments. This means that we will be able to
process customer enquiries more quickly in future.

MEASURES TO BOOST CUSTOMER
SATISFACTION
In 2018, we launched Quick Quotes, an expansion of
the self-service platform in the web channel, in order to
be able to process customer enquiries more effectively.
Thanks to Quick Quotes, our customers can receive
direct information about freight rates and can complete
their bookings immediately via the web channel as well as
download their order documentation. During the reporting
period, we improved the user-friendliness of Quick Quotes
and the customer area on our website (see Digitalisation,
p. 60 et seq.).
Since 2019, we have been providing key information
to customers in an even more transparent way via our
mobile app. The app enables users to track the cargo,
look up timetables and contact options, enquire about
freight rates and make bookings. Other digital products
for our customers are in the planning and development
stages or are undergoing continual improvement (see
Digitalisation, p. 60 et seq.).

Corporate social
responsibility
Hapag-Lloyd is a company steeped in tradition: with its
roots in Hamburg for the past 172 years, the company is
now active around the world. We are governed by Hanseatic principles that are firmly anchored in our corporate
culture. We are involved with a wide range of projects
that primarily relate to shipping. We support projects both
financially and through the personal commitment of our
employees.
ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES AND
AWARD CRITERIA
The main responsibility for Hapag-Lloyd’s corporate
citizenship lies with the Corporate Communication
department and the Executive Board. They decide which
projects and initiatives will be supported during the year
and also set the annual budget for donations. Corporate
Communications is informed of the financial expenses in
advance of each donation.
Our donation activity is guided by our economic success
and is transparently regulated by a policy that applies to
the entire Company. In accordance with this policy, we do
not make any donations to political parties.

When selecting the projects that we support through
donations and sponsorships, we ensure that they are
relevant to Hamburg and the shipping industry or have a
high public profile. In the 2019 reporting year, we spent a
total of approximately EUR 500,000 (2018: EUR 421,100)
on corporate citizenship worldwide.
Part of our financial support is provided by the HapagLloyd Stiftung, a charitable foundation which was set up
in 1997 to mark the 150th anniversary of Hapag-Lloyd. It
primarily supports culture, science and social projects in
Hamburg, where the company’s headquarters are located. The foundation establishes projects and events on
its own as well as in cooperation with long-term partners.
It supports young talent in the worlds of theatre, ballet
and music, for example. The foundation is not part of the
Group and acts independently.

Wide-ranging
commitment in 2019
We have close traditional ties to shipping. For this reason
we support seafarers’ missions such as the Duckdalben
in Hamburg, the German Maritime Search and Rescue
Association (DGzRS) and maritime museums and memorials, as well as sports and cultural events.
A TRADITION OF HELPING OTHERS
The Albert Ballin Forum
To mark 101 years since the death of former Hapag-Lloyd
General Director Albert Ballin on 9 November 2019,
­Hapag-Lloyd held the Albert Ballin Forum in Hamburg.
Around 400 guests attended the round of talks entitled
“Hamburg in the highly-charged environment of globalisation and digitalisation”. These talks saw five of Hamburg’s
former mayors engaged in deep discussions: Klaus von
Dohnanyi, Ortwin Runde, Ole von Beust, Christoph Ahlhaus and Peter Tschentscher, who between them represent more than 25 years of political and social commitment to the City of Hamburg. They discussed the current
and future development of the city as well as further
globalisation and increasing digitalisation. Matthias Iken,
deputy managing editor of the “Hamburger Abendblatt”
newspaper, chaired the event.
Supporting local projects in Hamburg
We also support cultural and sports activities in Hamburg. For example, Hapag-Lloyd was a partner of Filmfest
Hamburg and the main sponsor of the premier league ice
hockey team, the Hamburg Crocodiles, We also support
the annual horse race in Hamburg’s Horn district. In 2019,
we organised events for local clubs and initiatives such as
the Rotary and Lions Clubs. Various public events were
held in 2019 at our headquarters on Ballindamm, including
the “Zeit” newspaper’s “Lange Nacht der ZEIT” evening
event, lecture evenings and concerts.

ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION
Our environmental action includes protection of endangered species. For example, our exclusion list of goods
that we do not transport includes whale meat, shark fins
and hunting trophies (see Environmental and water protection, p. 77 et seq.). Our Cargo Patrol programme helps
us with the practical implementation of this internal policy
(see Dangerous goods, p. 57 et seq.).
Our Global Service Center in India aims to reduce greenhouse gases through a number of tree-planting initiatives.
In a pilot project with local organisation Sankalp Taru, 186
trees were planted in Chennai and Mumbai. The project
will continue in 2020 as part of a close partnership and
with the planting of 800 additional trees.

94

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 9

In addition to our global environmental action, we are also
involved in numerous projects in Hamburg. Since 2015,
we have been a member of UmweltPartnerschaft Hamburg and have championed efforts to promote voluntary
environmental protection among companies in Hamburg.

RESEARCH AND EDUCATION
Promotion of and exchange with the academic
community
During the reporting period, Hapag-Lloyd once again
donated EUR 200,000 to the Hapag-Lloyd Center for
Shipping and Global Logistics (CSGL) at Kühne Logistics
University. This centre was founded in 2018 to research
topics such as digitalisation, sustainability and value creation in the shipping and logistics industry. The funding is
primarily used for scientific equipment.
The partnership also aims to hold joint events and an
information exchange on research results. In 2019, mutual
events were organised, such as the podium discussion on
“Quality in the container shipping industry”, in which our
Executive Board and the Head of Corporate Communications participated as speakers and presenters.
Promotion of vocational training and
degree programmes
In 2000, we launched Hamburger Ausbildungs-Netzwerk
(HANz!) in partnership with the Otto Group. HANz! prepares secondary school students for apprenticeships.
Hapag-Lloyd also finances three out of a total of 18
Hamburg scholarships which have been awarded by the
Studierendenwerk Hamburg student association since
2018. These scholarships support refugees from conflict
zones to complete a course with a strong IT focus.
We have been working with the Gymnasium Johanneum in Hamburg and other schools, some of which are
international, for several years now. In 2019, we again
worked with these schools to put a number of projects
such as internships, career presentations and ship visits
into action.

SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT
Our company and employees are involved in a wide range
of social initiatives and projects around the world. Young
employees in the Talent Development Programme (TDP)
are particularly active.
Crisis relief and support of refugees
Hamburg employees participating in the Talent Development Programme (TDP) supported the Hanseatic Help
clothing store with bake sales and donation boxes for a
refugee camp in Iraq. As a result, we were able to send a
container with 362 boxes of clothing and other things to
Erbil, Iraq, in August 2019.
We were involved in refugee relief from 2015 to summer
2019, particularly via the “Hapag-Lloyd hilft” project. This
project actively brought together staff, refugees, volunteers, the housing and assistance organisation “Fördern
und Wohnen” and the municipal authorities. As part of the
project, we celebrated with an evening meal at the end of
the fasting month of Ramadan with refugees in Hamburg.
We supplemented our activities with a football programme
with refugees.
Help for those in need
For the second year in a row, we supported the “People
in Need” project of the Peruvian organisation “Juguete
Pendiente”. This project distributes clothing, food and toys
to people in need in the provinces of Cusco, Arequipa and
Puno. Hapag-Lloyd employees collected donations for
the project or made donations themselves. The donations

W I D E - R A N G I N G C O M M I T M E N T I N 2 0 1 9 | C O R P O R AT E S O C I A L R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y

were presented in the summer, some of them in person by
our colleagues.
International children’s aid projects
In 2019, a member of TDP from Peru became involved
with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, whose mission is to
fulfil the wishes of terminally ill children, by fulfilling the
wishes of two children with leukaemia.
During the reporting period, we once again supported
the non-profit “In Your Hands Foundation”, headed by
one of our staff members in New Jersey (USA). Support
was again in the form of school supplies donated by
­Hapag-Lloyd staff. This enabled the organisation to supply
disadvantaged children in the region with 150 school bags
filled with supplies.

95

In the past, we provided an orphanage in Chiang Mai
(Thailand) with books as part of the “Build-A-Library”
project. The library is very popular with the children and is
now used daily.
Combating loneliness
At our headquarters in Hamburg, the TDP organised
a staff visit to the Hamburg association “Freunde alter
Menschen” (Friends of Older People). The organisation’s
mission is to combat loneliness among older people.
Nearly 20 senior citizens who live by themselves in
­Hamburg responded to our invitation to coffee and cake
at our headquarters. Both sides were enthusiastic about
the personal exchange between the guests and our
employees.

INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S REPORT ON
A LIMITED ASSURANCE ENGAGEMENT ON
NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING 1

Independence and Quality Control of the Audit Firm
We have complied with the German professional provisions regarding independence as well as other ethical
requirements.

To Hapag-Lloyd AG, Hamburg
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on
the combined separate non-financial report pursuant to §§
(articles) 289b Abs. (paragraph) 3 and 315b Abs. 3 HGB
(“Handelsgesetzbuch”: “German Commercial Code”) of
Hapag-Lloyd AG, Hamburg, (hereinafter the “Company”)
for the period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019
which comprises the sections marked with the acronym
“NfB” in the Sustainability Report 2019 of the Company
(hereinafter the “Non-financial Report”).

Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements and
professional standards – in particular the Professional
Code for German Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer und
vereidigte Buchprüfer”: “BS WP/vBP”) as well as the
Standard on Quality Control 1 published by the Institut der
Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany;
IDW): Requirements to quality control for audit firms (IDW
Qualitätssicherungsstandard 1: Anforderungen an die
Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis - IDW
QS 1) – and accordingly maintains a comprehensive
system of quality control including documented policies
and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and
regulatory requirements.

Responsibilities of the Executive Directors
The executive directors of the Company are responsible
for the preparation of the Non-financial Report in accordance with §§ (articles) 315c in conjunction with 289c to
289e HGB.
This responsibility of Company’s executive directors includes the selection and application of appropriate methods
of non-financial reporting as well as making assumptions and estimates related to individual non-financial
disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances.
Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for
such internal control as they have considered necessary
to enable the preparation of a Non-financial Report that is
free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or
error.

1	PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH has performed a limited assurance engagement on the German version of the combined separate non-financial report
and issued an independent assurance report in German language, which is
authoritative. The following text is a translation of the independent assurance
report

Practitioner’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance
conclusion on the Non-financial Report based on the
assurance engagement we have performed.
Within the scope of our engagement, we did not perform
an audit on external sources of information or expert
­opinions, referred to in the Non-financial Report.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance
with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements
other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires
that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to
allow us to conclude with limited assurance that nothing
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that
the Company’s Non-financial Report for the period from
1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 has not been

I N D E P E N D E N T P R A C I T I O N E R ’ S R E P O R T | I N F O R M AT I O N

prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with §§
(articles) 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB.
In a limited assurance engagement the assurance procedures are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance
engagement, and therefore a substantially lower level of
assurance is obtained. The assurance procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgment.
Within the scope of our assurance engagement, we
performed amongst others the following assurance procedures and further activities:

Intended Use of the Assurance Report
We issue this report on the basis of the engagement
agreed with the Company. The assurance engagement
has been performed for purposes of the Company and the
report is solely intended to inform the Company about the
results of the limited assurance engagement. The report
is not intended for any third parties to base any (financial) decision thereon. Our responsibility lies only with the
Company. We do not assume any responsibility towards
third parties.

Frankfurt am Main, 19. March 2020
–	Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization
–	Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the
Non-financial Report regarding the preparation process,
the internal control system relating to this process and
selected disclosures in the Non-financial Report
–	Identification of the likely risks of material misstatement
of the Non-financial Report
–	Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures in the
Non-financial Report
–	Comparison of selected disclosures with corresponding
data in the consolidated financial statement and in the
group management report of Hapag-Lloyd AG
–	Evaluation of the presentation of the non-financial information
Assurance Conclusion
Based on the assurance procedures performed and
assurance evidence obtained, nothing has come to our
attention that causes us to believe that the Company’s
Non-financial Report for the period from 1 January 2019
to 31 December 2019 has not been prepared, in all
material aspects, in accordance with §§ (articles) 315c in
conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB.

“WE WANT TO DRIVE
MARITIME ENERGY
REFORM WITH

The Paris climate targets affect all of us. The shipping
­industry also needs – and wants – to play its part in
reducing emissions that are damaging to the environment.
As the first shipping company in the world to convert a

“OUR OCCUPATIONAL
SAFETY MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM ENSURES THAT
OUR FLEET OPERATIONS
ARE SAFE.”
In order to counteract the various dangers that occur
when working on the open sea, comprehensive safety
measures are needed. Fleet Management’s occupational
safety management ­system was certified in accordance
with OHSAS 18001 last year.
This certification represents not just the safety of our
employees, but also smooth on-board workflows that
our customers can rely on.

DIRECTOR FLEET MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
Sophia Laux is responsible for the certification of
our occupational health and safety management

“WITH THIS PROJECT,
WE ARE BRINGING HOPE
TO HAITI.”
In 2018, our employees in Canada assisted with the “Hope
for Haiti” project for the eighth time. With our partners, we
shipped school materials and furniture as well as sports
­equipment in two 40-foot containers from Toronto in Canada
to Jacmel in southern Haiti. With these supplies, our aim is
to give hope to young people there and, in particular, provide
them with an opportunity to access education.

FOREWORD OF THE EXECUTIVE
BOARD

— 102-14

Ladies and gentlemen,

With nearly 12 million containers (TEU) transported and a fleet of 227 ships, Hapag-Lloyd
is one of the biggest liner shipping companies in the world. Every day, our approximately
12,800 employees make a passionate commitment to a well-functioning global trade network
– after all, 90% of all goods are transported by ship today. Without efficient transportation via
­container ship, the global exchange of goods to this extent would be simply impossible. We
have a significant responsibility towards our business partners and are strongly committed to
­sustainable business practices, for we are not only a professional logistics company; we see
ourselves as a member of society.
During the reporting year, we carefully reviewed our future plans and developed a new corpor­
ate strategy. The focus of our Strategy 2023 is to become no less than number one in terms of
quality. We will only be able to achieve this if we continue to scrutinise ourselves and adapt to
new situations – including those that deal with sustainability. In doing so, we are guided by the
clearly defined principles of our Global Code of Ethics, which form the framework for a fair, moral
and ethical approach to our interest groups.

FOREWORD OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

We continued to push ahead with our sustainability activities through a whole host of initiatives
in 2018. For example, our combined quality and environmental management (QEM) system
was once again certified to ISO standards. Furthermore, Hapag-Lloyd was included in the
“Qualship 21” programme of the United States Coast Guard as a result of its particularly high
quality standards. This very special accolade underscores both our commitment to achieving the highest safety standards on board and the quality of our fleet. At the end of the year,
we also launched the Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative (SRTI) online platform, which we
co-founded. The platform aims to increase transparency regarding ship recycling practices and
thus establish a globally standardised process that takes into account all relevant environmental
aspects.
Thanks to the modernisation of our fleet and various efficiency measures, last year we were
once again able to effectively reduce our average fuel consumption. Ongoing investments in our
ships and the responsible use of equipment will continue to be major areas of focus in terms of
environmental and climate protection. On the one hand, we support the ambitious International
Maritime Organization (IMO) goal of reducing absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 by
50% compared with 2008 figures. On the other hand, in keeping with our own goals, we will
reduce our specific CO2 emissions per TEU-kilometre by 20% by 2020 as compared with
2016 figures.
One enormous challenge for all shipowners, including us, is a new IMO directive that will enter
into force on 1 January 2020 and will reduce the maximum sulphur content of ship fuels from
3.5% to 0.5%. This directive will significantly improve the shipping industry’s environmental
footprint. Low-sulphur fuels are a key solution for us as we continue complying with legal requirements. We are also testing other emission-reducing technologies which may present options for
a small portion of our fleet. For example, we are converting the world’s first container ship to run
on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and are installing exhaust gas treatment systems.
We will not cease the expansion of our involvement. We will continue to focus on implementing
our strategic agenda, creating added value for our owners and customers while we further our
entrepreneurial and sustainable approach.
We warmly invite you to find out more about the other areas we’re involved in, and hope you
enjoy reading our sustainability report.

Hamburg, 20 March 2019
Sincerely,

Rolf Habben Jansen
(Chief Executive Officer)

This is the second sustainability report (SR) issued by the
Hapag-Lloyd Group and Hapag-Lloyd AG. It contains the
combined separate non-financial report (NfR). In line with
the requirements of the German CSR Guideline Implementation Act (CSR-RUG), the statements complete the
financial reporting of Hapag-Lloyd with disclosures on significant non-financial aspects in accordance with Sections
315b and 315c in conjunction with 289b to 289e of the
German Commercial Code (HGB). — NfR

The group of consolidated companies, which comprises
­Hapag-Lloyd AG companies and affiliated consolidated companies, is listed in the 2018 annual report,
p. 178 ff. — NfR
The group of consolidated companies also comprises the
companies of UASC Ltd. (United Arab Shipping Company). They were included in the consolidated financial
statements of Hapag-Lloyd AG at the time of the transfer of control on 24 May 2017. As a result, the financial
indicators for 2017 presented in the NfR can only be
compared to the 2016 and 2018 figures to a limited
extent. — NfR

The sustainability report provides extensive information about the Group’s sustainability activities and goes
beyond the legal requirements. All disclosures which are
part of the NfR and serve to ensure compliance with CSRRUG are marked “NfR”. — NfR

References to disclosures outside the Group management
report constitute additional information and are not part of
the NfR. — NfR

Unless otherwise indicated, all disclosures in this report
relate to the entire group of consolidated companies.

ABOUT THIS REPORT

An essential connection relevant for understanding the
amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the
Group management report was not established. — NfR
The topic of supply chain refers to all aspects which have
been identified as being subject to mandatory reporting; the topic itself, however, does not require reporting.
Instead, it is addressed in a separate chapter that is not
part of the NfR. — NfR
The NfR is published every year in English and German on
the Hapag-Lloyd website. In it, Hapag-Lloyd reports on
the progress made in the financial year under review, from
1 January to 31 December. This NfR concerns the 2018
financial year. — NfR
The content of the NfR was subjected to a voluntary
operational audit in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised)
with limited assurance by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft. The audit assignment
and result can be found in the Independent practitioner’s
report on a limited assurance engagement on non-financial reporting at the end of this SR. The NfR is based on
the internationally recognised Sustainability Reporting
Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards). We based our reporting on GRI Standard 103 as
regards the presentation of concepts for the NfR-related
aspects. Non-financial indicators based on the relevant
GRI Standards have also been reported for these aspects
wherever such standards exist. Some of the content of
the report is marked for the NfR as well as for the GRI
Standards. This content was not checked against the
requirements of the GRI Standards. — NfR

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

In 2018, we were guided for the first time by the United
Nation’s (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The
SDGs that are relevant to us are presented via the SDG
icons at the start of each chapter.
The information was requested electronically and the data
were predominantly recorded using area-specific software. It is not yet possible to present a three-year trend
for many of the indicators, although the aim is to achieve
this in the future. When adding up data, rounding differences may occur. All forward-looking statements in the
NfR are based on the assumptions valid at copy deadline.
Due to unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors,
the actual results, developments or performance of the
company may differ from our forecasts, assessments and
announcements (see Management report, p. 55 ff.). — NfR
To ensure legibility, we do not use gender-specific double
pronouns in the NfR. This is not intended as indicative. All
pronouns should be regarded as gender-neutral. — NfR
The statements on the group of consolidated companies
and on the reporting period as well as on the gathering of
information and on legibility also apply to the SR.
Our assessment is that sustainability reporting complies
with the requirements of the Core Option of the GRI
Standards.
You can find further information at Hapag-Lloyd.com/en
and in the annual report. The next sustainability report is
scheduled for publication in April 2020.

HAPAG-LLOYD
COMPREHENSIVE QEM SYSTEM RECERTIFIED
ONCE AGAIN

The Hapag-Lloyd quality and ­environmental
management (QEM) system once again
achieved double certification according to the
ISO standards 9001:2015 and 14001:2015
in 2018. The Middle East region was included
for the first time after implementing our QEM
system within a very short time frame. The
scope of the certification is really remarkable
since the QEM includes all activities of our
door-to-door transport worldwide.

OUR PROFILE
Thanks to its many years of experience, growing market coverage and wide service
network, Hapag-Lloyd is a strong global partner. We are one of the world’s leading
container liner shipping companies – a position that we have been able to build
on with two successful mergers in recent years. With our new Strategy 2023, we
are continuing to pursue this path. — NfR

OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP

are maintained thanks to our long-term partnerships and
proven suppliers. — NfR — 102-2

Its global market coverage, transported container volume
and transport capacities make Hapag-Lloyd one of the
world’s leading container liner shipping companies. Specifically, our core business is the shipping of containers by
sea. We also offer door-to-door transport services around
the world and support our customers with pre-carriage
and on-carriage by inland waterway, rail and road, thanks
to our many years of experience. In doing so, we always
make sure that we use the most sustainable mode of
transport. The transport of non-containerised cargo is also
part of our service portfolio. Our high quality standards

Since the company was founded in 1847, the H
­ apag-Lloyd
headquarters have been located in Hamburg. Today,
around 12,800 employees (Hapag-Lloyd AG: around
3,400 employees) work with us in 57 countries. We dispose of 227 modern container ships (previous year: 219)
and have an annual transport volume of around 11.9
million TEU. Globally, we operate 119 liner services, which
enable us to offer fast and secure connections.

evenly between the product categories, with the smallest
category accounting for 5% of the transport volume and
the biggest category accounting for 16%. This makes our
business relatively unaffected by economic cycles within
individual industries, allowing us to maintain steady growth
under normal economic conditions. — NfR

GROUP RESTRUCTURING AND MERGERS
— 102-10

We are active in five regions: Asia, the Middle East,
Europe, North America and Latin America. We have
divided these into 35 areas. In order to further optimise
our coverage of the Middle East region after the merger
with UASC (United Arab Shipping Company), these
areas have been revised. From 2019, there will be four
areas in the region instead of five. — 102-4, 102-6, 102-7
Hapag-Lloyd has partially bundled its customer service
business in China (see Employee retention, p. 29 ff.) and
the US. The bundling in each location makes it possible to
concentrate expertise in what are known as Quality Service
Centers. All sales functions remain the responsibility of the
various branches. Due to the size of the units, we are able
to significantly improve our training, representation and
coverage of spikes in workload. The relevant bundling was
also initiated at the end of the reporting year in the Middle
East region.

The activities initiated by the UASC merger were largely
completed in the previous year. In 2018 we also successfully moved offices, winding up the UASC business
(including accounting) and merging local legal entities.
The process was gratifyingly smooth thanks to the open
corporate cultures and communication between the companies involved. The dialogue between the management
on both sides was professional and constructive right from
the start. The staff at each company were also broadly
accepting of each other’s culture (see Open corporate
culture, p. 35 f.). This made the merger of the two organisations run much more smoothly.
In addition, we facilitated the merger with specific training
sessions on our processes and systems, as well by providing active support in daily working life. In this way, we
were able to ensure that all of our staff were able to offer
our customers the services to which they are accustomed.
The cooperation with our new colleagues was also fostered by team-building and company events. The highlight
in 2018 was the Hapag-Lloyd football tournament, which
saw employees from around the world meet in Hamburg.

H A PA G - L L O Y D | O U R P R O F I L E

The recent mergers have enabled us to expand our
­comprehensive range of services for our customers,
as well as our presence on all the main East–West and
North–South routes.
The successful merger of three shipping companies within
such a short period of time was only possible with dedicated and expert staff, as well as a systematic organisation working in line with a scalable blueprint. The blueprint
is implemented globally and ensures the same organisational structures and units within each of the areas. This
means that newly established units – as the Saudi Arabia
area is already showing with great success – are already
in a position to push ahead with pilot projects concerning
major future issues, such as digitalisation.

We will review the extent to which we are able to meet
our aim of being a quality leader using the Net Promoter
Score (NPS), an indicator that refers to customer ­loyalty.
­Furthermore, we will also analyse the degree to which
we are able to keep our punctuality promise. In order to
­support the punctuality of our deliveries, we will define
punctuality levels and create the technical framework to
be able to measure and report on these in a standardised
way. We also want to be able to meet specific customer
requirements with more tailored premium products in
future. To this end, we will be expanding our product portfolio (see Customer focus, p. 75 f.). — NfR
The new strategy also provides for a further increase in
profitability across the entire transport route. Together with
our partners, we want to increase the proportion of doorto-door business by 2023. In doing so, we are relying
more heavily on partnerships, for instance, in the procurement of ­transport services. We will be further standardising and optimising processes and systematically
improving the qualifications of our staff (see Procurement
organisation, p. 68 f.). — NfR
In addition, we aim to further increase the agility of the
organisation so that Hapag-Lloyd is better placed to
react quickly to spontaneous changes on the market.
For us, agility means a keen willingness to learn, flexibility
in project development and openness to new forms of
cooperation. — NfR

New Group strategy: Strategy 2023
The primary aim of our business is to ensure long-term
profitable growth. We measure this on the basis of the
development of transport volume and the key perform­
ance indicators of EBITDA and EBIT. To support this goal,
the Executive Board presented the new Group strategy,
Strategy 2023, in November 2018. The s­ trategy forms
the operational guideline for Hapag-Lloyd to ­follow in the
coming years in order to achieve organic growth. — NfR
Major aspects of the strategy include securing its pos­
ition as a global player and establishing Hapag-Lloyd as
the quality leader that sets industry standards in terms of
reliability and service. In order to be able to measure the
success of the targets defined in Strategy 2023, we have
supplemented previously established financial indicators
with non-financial performance indicators. — NfR

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

We are underlying our efforts to improve cost structures
and increase service quality with consistent digitalisation. By using new technologies and pushing ahead with
automation, we are continually optimising our internal
processes and systems. By 2023, we want to be booking
at least 15% of the Group’s total volume through the Web
Channel (see Customer focus, p. 75 f.). — NfR
As a company with a tradition of environmental awareness, it will also remain a given that we will continue to
comply with stricter environmental requirements in the
years to come, and that we will implement the necessary
technical and organisational changes with the greatest
care. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) will be
implementing a new directive for a global upper limit for
sulphur of 0.5% for marine fuels by 1 January 2020, for
example (see Climate protection and reduction of emissions, p. 62 ff.). — NfR

O U R P R O F I L E | H A PA G - L L O Y D

Strong partner in THE Alliance — 102-7, 102-13
In April 2017, we joined forces with our Asian partners
to create THE Alliance – initially for a period of five years.
Within the alliance, we were able to serve all major East–
West routes with a total of 246 ships (previous year: 244).
Thanks to this comprehensive network, the alliance of
shipping companies is able to serve 30 routes (previous
year: 32) linking 74 major ports worldwide (previous year:
76). We regularly engage in dialogue with our alliance
partners in order to ensure the best possible and most
flexible use of the ships within the network. Our customers
around the world benefit from extensive port coverage, an
efficient fleet and fast transit times.

FINANCIAL INDICATORS
Wide-reaching efficiency gains and cost
­improvements — 102-7, 201/103, 201-1
We continuously work on making our processes more
efficient and achieving cost savings. We already tested our
network collaboratively during the transition phase of the
merger with UASC in 2017. In doing so, we identified and
optimised services in our portfolio that were not profitable
or were duplicated. The core services of both shipping
companies were continued so as to maintain the existing
customer base and expand it in the future.

09

Through the merger with UASC, Hapag-Lloyd was able
to integrate highly efficient ships into its fleet and realise
economies of scale. We already achieved the complete
cost savings of approximately USD 435 million in 2018 as
a result of implementing synergies. The savings resulted
from the integration of the service network and the optimised use of the shared fleet, among others.
Positive economic growth — 102-7, 201/103, 201-1
As a result of the merger with UASC, we can now draw
on one of the largest and most cutting-edge container
shipping fleets in the world. In 2018, our fleet grew from
219 ships to 227. In consequence, our transport capacity
increased from 1.57 million TEU to 1.64 million TEU and
our total container volume to around 2.56 million TEU.
As a result of the merger, our transport volume increased
by around 21%, from 9,803 TTEU in the previous year to
11,874 TTEU.
Our revenue increased by 15.5% to EUR 11,515 million
(previous year: EUR 9,973 million), while EBITDA for the
financial year reached EUR 1,138 million (previous year:
EUR 1,055 million). Our operating result (EBIT) of EUR
443.0 million in 2018 was higher than in the previous year
(EUR 411.4 million). The freight rate1 was USD 1,044/TEU
in the 2018 financial year, down on the previous year’s
level of USD 1,060/TEU.
1	For the FY 2018, revenues for additional services in Latin America and Turkey
were included in the calculation of the freight rate. The previous year's figures
were adjusted accordingly.

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT
It is our aim to shape our current business processes in such a way that the oppor­
tunities and outlook for future generations are not jeopardised. We therefore take
sustainable development as a basis for our business processes and actively promote
the sustainable thinking and behaviour of our staff using a wide range of measures.
We have also integrated the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United
Nations into our sustainability report for the first time. — NfR

SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES
We take responsibility for our actions and decisions. In our
sustainability policy, we have laid out binding guidelines
and principles for our activities. In them, we commit to
protecting the environment, to providing our customers
with the highest quality, to securing satisfactory returns for
our owners and to ensuring the health and safety of our
employees.
For us, a cornerstone of sustainability is complying with all
laws as well as the rules of conduct specified in our Global
Code of Ethics. Our management continually develops
the Company’s strategic direction with an eye towards
raising awareness and fulfilling our quality and environmental objectives. As a company, we maintain an active
and open dialogue with our stakeholders. This helps us to
continually improve our quality, environmental and safety
standards (see Hapag-Lloyd, p. 05 ff.).
Our employees are the basis for our success. In order to
remain attractive as an employer over the long term, we
offer them various options for further training and other
benefits (see Employees, p. 25 ff.) as well as a safe and
healthy work environment (see Health and safety, p. 37 ff.).
In the interest of a healthy employee structure, we have
our employee related conditions and processes checked
internally and via external audits.
We want to improve our services on an ongoing basis. We
do this with the targeted application of digital solutions.
For instance, the Digital Channel and Incubation Unit
(DCIU) contributes to a significant improvement in processes on the customer side as well as to the successful
digital transformation of the company (see Digitalisation
and digital security, p. 49 ff.).

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

We want to preserve our environment. By using the most
modern technology, we are able to significantly cut our
fleet’s CO2 emissions and actively contribute to environmental protection (see Environmental and climate protection, p. 57 ff.). Furthermore, we prevent potential safety
hazards to people, the environment, cargo and our property by taking proactive measures. This also involves us
taking a responsible stance in terms of recycling ships.
The high standards that we set ourselves also apply to our
suppliers and subcontractors. Together with our business partners, we continually seek solutions for improved
sustainability in our transport chain (see Supply chain,
p. 67 ff.).
With our wide-ranging social involvement, we contribute
to society in many different ways above and beyond our
direct business activities (see Social, p. 77 ff.).
Since 2007, our Fleet Management has carried “DNV
GL Excellence – 5 Stars” certification. Eleven years ago,
we were the first container liner shipping company to be
awarded this benchmark, which not only requires the
implementation of occupational safety measures (MLC
2006 certification) but also certification according to
ISO 9001 (quality), ISO 14001 (environment), the ISM
(Inter­national Safety Management) Code and the ISPS
(Inter­national Ship and Port Facility Security) Code on
preventing maritime hazards. The “DNV GL Excellence – 5
Stars” certification is the first international standard that
comprises all of these requirements. It also incorporates
standards that go far beyond these international norms
and regulations. The certification that was renewed in
2017 is valid until the end of 2019. — NfR

S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y M A N A G E M E N T | H A PA G - L L O Y D

We have continued to expand our sustainability management over recent years and have already made gratifying
progress. We will continue to develop our sustainability
management in the years to come. In doing so, we must
first be consistent with Strategy 2023. In the strategy, we
have clearly defined our aspiration to be a quality provider.
The quality and environmental management (QEM) system
and the corresponding certifications are already contributing to this, for example.

11

We analysed in detail how competitors and companies
from other industries contribute to achieving the SDGs.
Subsequently, we compared the existing activities, measures and initiatives from a number of our different areas
with the content of the SDGs. We wanted to know which
positive contribution Hapag-Lloyd makes towards the
17 SDGs and their 169 subgoals. The results of this ana­
lysis indicate that we already contribute to the following
UN sustainability goals2:

We also want to contribute to the protection of people and
the environment beyond our Company borders. For this
reason, in 2018, Sustainability Management dealt extensively with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
and their integration in the company.

ORGANISATION OF SUSTAINABILITY
MANAGEMENT — 102-18
Sustainability Management is responsible for coordinating
and supporting all our sustainability activities. From an
organisational point of view, it is part of Corporate Development and reports directly to the Executive Board. It

looks after our Group-wide QEM system, is responsible
for certifications in accordance with ISO 9001 and 14001
and is in charge of preparing the Group’s sustainability
report. Furthermore, Sustainability Management responds
to customer enquiries about sustainability topics and
coordinates internal working groups on sustainability-­
related topics. — NfR

In 2018, around 88% (Hapag-Lloyd AG: 77%) of all possible departments3 were certified in accordance with ISO
9001 and 14001 – which together form the Hapag-Lloyd
QEM certificate. This means that, among other things, the
complete management of container liner service activities is certified. This share decreased compared to the
previous year due to the fact that some organisational
units were still relatively new at the time the certificate
was issued. Here, a future certification is planned. In
addition, a statutory audit of the annual and consolidated
financial statements takes place every year. Parts of our
central Finance department provide material needed for
the audit and are therefore not integrated into the QEM
system. — NfR
Globally, we have established QEM delegates in the
regions, areas or central departments, as well as on
board our ships, who are responsible for the coordin­
ation of QEM and other sustainability activities. These

The Fleet Management department is already covered by the “DNV GL Excellence – 5 Stars” certification and is therefore not included in the assessment.

more than 130 contact partners (Hapag-Lloyd AG: more
than 60) support the Sustainability Management team at
headquarters through their activities. — NfR

Around 88%
of the departments have a QEM certificate. — NfR

We integrate new regions, areas, locations and ships into
the QEM system in a timely manner. To ensure that these
also meet our high quality and sustainability standards,
the responsible employees are trained accordingly. We
were thus able to integrate the new Middle East region
and other areas into the QEM system within the context of
recertification in 2018. Annual monitoring audits will take
place in the following two years for the certificates valid
until 2021. — NfR

S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y M A N A G E M E N T | H A PA G - L L O Y D

As part of the annual audit, topics such as occupational
safety, customer focus, employee training and evaluation
of service providers are monitored. The specialist departments are responsible for further, customised sustainability
topics. The 2018 audits confirmed that the requirements
of the ISO standards 9001 and 14001 updated in 2015
are being implemented successfully. We immediately
attended to minor areas for improvement that were identified in the detailed breakdown. — NfR
The Sustainability Management team regularly informs
the heads of division and regional representatives – the
Sustainability Committee – about ongoing sustainability
activities. The committee assists with efforts to identify

13

sustainability opportunities and risks, promotes the
sharing of information across divisions and is involved in
coordinating sustainability-related measures. In 2018, the
specialist departments involved engaged in a dialogue
about the updated quality and environmental management
(QEM) manual and the new QEM training programme.
The scope and timetable of the audit carried out by DNV
GL later in the year were also discussed. A presentation
was also made on how the first sustainability report implemented the requirements of the German CSR Guideline
Implementation Act (CSR-RUG). The Head of Corporate
Development chairs the meeting and reports directly to
the Executive Committee, which the Executive Board is
part of. — NfR

SIGNIFCANT ISSUES AND RISKS
Developments in society, the environment and the global economy influence our business and our corporate decisions. Structured observation of them is an important
tool for the corporate management of Hapag-Lloyd and enables us to identify key
topics and risks. — NfR

Together with our internal and external stakeholders, we
carried out an assessment of the materiality of sustain­
ability topics for this NfR and SR (see Material topics,
p. 15 ff.). In addition, we used the net method to examine
whether there are any relevant risks4 from the perspective
of our Group risk management system and what the relevant risks are (see Risk management, p. 14). If a relevant
risk is identified, the topic must be classified as material.
No further material topics were identified for the NfR or SR
in the risk analysis. — NfR

— 102-11

The risk management system
The basis of Hapag-Lloyd’s multilevel risk management
system are the divisions or regions, which are principally
responsible for communicating the relative potential
material risks to the company within the organisation. The
responsible risk manager must aggregate and evaluate
identified risks, and monitor them continuously if risk-miti­
gating measures are implemented. The risk managers
in the regions and specialist departments are experts in
their respective areas, and their awareness goes beyond
operational risks to include social and ecological aspects
(e.g. legal fuel sources, ship recycling and training and
education). — NfR

The long-term success of Hapag-Lloyd is directly dependent on the early identification of potential risks and opportunities resulting from our business operations, as well as
the proactive management of these risks and opportun­
ities. A prerequisite for this is the integrity of our corporate
and risk strategy. Awareness of sustainable approaches
and actions with regard to quality, the environment and
occupational safety is a fixed component of our corporate
policy and thus also our risk policy. — NfR

Central Risk Management is responsible for compiling
material risks and analysing the risk structure. This aids
the Risk Committee as the basis for monitoring the overall
risk situation. The Central Risk Management team reports
quarterly – or on an ad hoc basis where required – to the
Executive Board, which is responsible for safeguarding
the efficacy of the risk management system. The Audit
Committee monitors the effectiveness of the system at the
highest level and reports to the Supervisory Board. — NfR

Risks to the Company’s existence will be handled responsibly by means of a Group-wide Hapag-Lloyd risk management system; this is the organisational unit for the
identification, analysis, management and control of our
corporate risks. — NfR

Our risk management system thus makes a significant
contribution towards supporting corporate management in
its task of effectively managing increasingly complex risks
while considering environmental and social aspects and
increasing company value. — NfR

RISK MANAGEMENT

4	Risks are deemed to be relevant if they are associated with Hapag-Lloyd’s
business activities, business relationships, products or services and are very
likely to have serious negative effects on aspects such as the environment
or social involvement, for example. Other issues that are relevant for the risk
analysis include employee matters, observance of human rights and efforts to
combat corruption and bribery.

Systematic recording and evaluation
of non-financial risks
Sustainability Management is currently honing the process
for systematically recording and evaluating non-financial
risks. To do this, each area issues a risk report about relevant risks. There is an ongoing dialogue with Central Risk
Management in order to avoid the development of parallel
or different processes and to create synergies. — NfR

MATERIAL TOPICS

— 102-42, 102-46

A materiality analysis conducted in preparation for the
CSR-RUG in mid-2016 enabled us to identify 26 topics
from the areas of social commitment, the environment and
economy that are relevant to us. This process benefited
from the expertise of Hapag-Lloyd’s Sustainability Management team, whose in-depth discussions with various
stakeholder groups provided it with a comprehensive
overview of the topics that could potentially be material
for the Company. We involved more than 200 people from

C E N T R A L D E PA R T M E N T S

relevant stakeholder groups in the analysis and asked
them about their views of the topics. The stakeholders
consisted of employees, suppliers, customers, scientists,
shareholders, Works Council members and representatives from the general population and the business community. Within Hapag-Lloyd itself, the QEM delegates and
the heads of the specialist departments were surveyed.
The three biggest service providers per mode of transport, i.e. terminal, truck, rail and feeder, were selected as
relevant suppliers, while contact in day-to-day business
and regular communication were key for the other stakeholder groups. The results of the survey were evaluated by
our Sustainability Management team and used to create
a matrix. In preparation for the sustainability report in the
2018 reporting year, we also checked whether we needed
to return to other significant topics. We determined this
through dialogue with internal and external stakeholders
and also conducted a detailed mid-year competition ana­
lysis. As a result, the topics of “customer satisfaction” and
“responsible tax policy” were added for 2018. — NfR

S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 | H A PA G - L L O Y D A G

This sustainability report5 provides extensive information
on the topics identified as material. Following another
stakeholder survey in 2019, we will review our topic selection and update them if necessary. — NfR

The topics “Business strategy, taking account of opportunities and risks” and “Continuous improvement in service
and process quality” are each addressed directly within
the NfR sections when relevant. — NfR

In order to create the NfR, we also identified the topics
of relevance to the CSR-RUG. For this, the Sustainability
Management team assessed sustainability topics that
our business activities have an impact on, and reviewed
the significance of aspects for our business. The ­topics
identified during this process form part of the NfR. — NfR

Although social matters as defined by CSR-RUG play
an important role for Hapag-Lloyd, they do not meet the
materiality criteria of CSR-RUG. Beyond the NfR itself,
this SR also reports on other topics that are important to us but do not meet the materiality criteria of the
­CSR-RUG, such as our diverse activities in the social
arena (see Social, p. 77 ff.). — NfR

Information on topics which have been identified as subject to mandatory reporting can be found in the 2018
non-financial report in the sections on the following relevant aspects: environmental aspects, employee aspects,
combating bribery and corruption and upholding human
rights and data protection (compare to index on the
non-financial report, p. 03). — NfR
5	The topics marked “NfR” were identified in the materiality process as being
subject to mandatory reporting as part of the non-financial report in accordance with CSR-RUG.

STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE
— 102-40, 102-42, 102-43, 102-44

Dialogue with our various stakeholders is a valuable tool
for our corporate management that contributes to our
long-term success. We use various formats to regularly
communicate with our stakeholders so that we can find
out their expectations and perceptions and hear their
comments and ideas. This then enables us to identify
areas for improvement and translate them into actions. We
do this by way of direct conversations at trade fairs and
conferences, or at our Annual General Meeting, for example. During our day-to-day work, we deal with questions
on a wide range of topics, such as the development of
the company, risks, our employees and the environment,
cargo and data security, and compliance.
The sustainability report published in 2018 was the first
one in which we reported proactively and transparently
on relevant sustainability topics. In doing so, we went
considerably beyond CSR-RUG requirements to lay out a
comprehensive view of the sustainability performance of
our Company. In our first year of sustainability reporting,
we received the Building Public Trust Award in the SDAXlisted companies category, which is awarded by auditing
firm PwC and a jury of representatives from the fields of
science, consultancy and business. This positive feedback
is the impetus for us to continue providing the best possible information to our stakeholders.
Communication with our shareholders
We regularly inform our shareholders, analysts and potential investors about our Company’s development and
strategy. This is primarily handled by the Executive Board
and the Investor Relations (IR) team at investor events,
through investor conversations, and at the Annual General
Meeting. The IR area of the Hapag-Lloyd website also
provides extensive information.
We set great store by providing the capital market with
transparent information about our strategy and the outlook for our Company. We report relevant information
quickly and comprehensively. During the reporting period,
we were awarded the German Investor Relations Prize
in the SDAX-listed companies category for Best Investor
Relations Work. In addition, the head of Hapag-Lloyd’s

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

IR department, Heiko Hoffmann, won second place in
the SDAX Ranking of IR Professionals. Both accolades
were presented in June 2018 during the 21st DIRK
(German Investor Relations Association) conference by
“WirtschaftsWoche” business magazine, the Extel market
research institute and DIRK.
Communication with our employees
We want to actively foster open dialogue with our employees and minimise the (perceived) hierarchies in our
Company. We do this in part using unusual formats like
the weekly “Lunch with the Management” and bimonthly
meetings where staff present their activities to other
employees. “Breakfast with the Executive Board” also
takes place regularly in Hamburg. In addition, we offer
our staff based in Hamburg a visit to one of our container
ships, therefore facilitating dialogue between sea- and
land-based personnel. Our employee magazine also
informs our staff on a quarterly basis about important
issues and developments as well as interesting activities.
This information is continuously updated via the intranet.
The regular dialogue between the Executive Board and
the Works Council is also another major form of internal
dialogue (see Communication between employer and
employee, p. 36).
Communication with customers and
business partners
We are in regular communication with our customers,
business partners and suppliers. In the process, we are
increasingly fielding customers’ questions on sustainability
topics. We are working with our business partners such as
MAN and Schenker to promote issues like liquefied natural
gas (LNG) and environmental protection. We engage in
discussions with our suppliers about our code of conduct
and issues such as capacity expansions or shortages.
Political discussions
We also engage in regular dialogue with political representatives on a municipal, national and international level.
While we focus on infrastructural and social issues in our
home city of Hamburg, we primarily address environmental issues at an international level (see Involvement in
political discussions, p. 81 f.).

S I G N I F I C A N T I S S U E S A N D R I S K S | H A PA G - L L O Y D

Communication with non-governmental
organisations (NGOs)
We see our dialogue with national and international NGOs
as mandatory. We work in partnership with the environmental organisations OceanCare and WWF among others,
and conduct open discussions with NABU. It is important
for us to achieve mutual understanding on critical topics.
For this reason, we engage in direct dialogue and take an
active role in finding solutions – for example, by engaging
in face-to-face discussions, participating in conferences
and working on committees. Key issues that we focus
on here are ship recycling, pollution emissions and the
transportation of controversial goods (see Environmental
action, p. 79).
Communication with Hamburg and the local
community
Hapag-Lloyd is a traditional Hamburg company, which is
why maintaining a dialogue with our local citizens is close
to our hearts. Every year, for example, we open our doors
to interested Hamburg citizens as part of Supply Chain
Day (Tag der Logistik) and Heritage Day (Tag des offenen
Denk­mals) and invite them to public cultural and informational events (see Action at home, p. 81).
Memberships — 102-13
Through our membership in various associations, working
groups and institutions, we are able to play a role in shaping and developing on various topics. One example is the
Prevention Specialist Committee (Marine) of the German
Employers’ Liability Insurance Association (BG)-Transport. The committee campaigns to have the treatment of
post-traumatic stress disorders among crew members
included in the catalogue of services of BG-Transport.
Another example is our joining the Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative (SRTI) in 2018. By joining the initiative,
we want to guarantee environmentally friendly ship recyc­
ling with safe working conditions.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE
Hapag-Lloyd wants to be perceived by its stakeholders as a responsible and c
­ redible
partner. Their trust in our Company and its management significantly strengthens
our corporate success. The corporate governance and compliance structures and
processes that we have established around the world, such as the Global Code of
­E thics, are an important basis for this.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
A key aspect for ensuring responsible management of the
Company that is geared towards sustainable appreciation
is good corporate governance. The Executive Board and
Supervisory Board use the applicable laws, in particular
the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), to manage
and monitor the Company. The two boards demonstrate
their commitment to the GCGC by issuing an annual
declaration of conformity in accordance with Section 161
of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). In addition,
the Executive Board and Supervisory Board report on
corporate governance in the yearly Corporate Governance
Report, which is published along with the declaration on
corporate governance (see 2018 annual report, p 20 ff.).

COMPLIANCE

implementation of applicable laws and must continuously monitor compliance with these additional regulations. — NfR
Our Company expressly commits to fair competition as
well as compliance with all applicable national and inter­
national laws, in particular with regard to corruption,
bribery and price fixing. We strictly oppose any violations
of these laws and do not tolerate them in any way. Violations of applicable laws are subject to prosecution.
This position is underpinned by the Executive Board’s
compliance statement. — NfR
In April 2018, Hapag-Lloyd joined the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN), which aims to stamp out all
forms of corruption and to promote fair trade. In doing so,
we emphasise our dedication to our existing commitment
to take an active stand against all forms of corruption and
to work for corruption-free trade in the maritime industry. — NfR

Compliance – that is, adherence to laws, standards and
regulations – is exceptionally important to our Company.
It ensures that we act in accordance with the law and
outside parties are also showing an increasing interest in
it. — NfR
For us, the biggest challenges to compliance result
from new or updated laws and external guidelines. The
increasing volume of legislation means that the Group
must put in place new processes and measures for the

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

Compliance organisation
The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the central
Compliance department, while our Company-wide compliance programme is implemented by officers in the regions
and national subsidiaries. Our compliance organisation
makes it possible to fundamentally implement measures
as part of the compliance programme which ensure that
the Company complies with laws and internal and external guidelines. The Executive Board and the Supervisory
Board’s Audit and Financial Committee are regularly
updated via compliance reports. — NfR

Global Code of Ethics
— 102-16, 406/103, 407/103, 407-1, 408-1, 409-1, 412-2

Our corporate culture is manifested in our Global Code of
Ethics. This formalises the basic values of our Group and
defines the behaviour we expect of our management and
employees, both internally and externally. It also contains
the principles that we consider to be essential for dealing
fairly with each other, customers and business partners.
The code is available in German, English, Chinese and
Spanish. — NfR
The first basic value of the Global Code of Ethics is the
observance of human rights, which directly refers to the
United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The code also reflects the content of the International
Labour Organization’s (ILO) core labour standards, such
as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination, as well as
the prohibition of child or forced labour and sub-standard
working conditions. This also includes the right to freedom
of association and collective bargaining. — NfR
Globally, each Hapag-Lloyd employee on land regularly
takes part in mandatory Web-based training sessions on
our Global Code of Ethics. Our employees at sea who
work on vessels managed by our Fleet Management team
receive information about these topics via the “fleet circular”, a fleet newsletter. The values of the Global Code of
Ethics are also integrated into numerous Group-wide and

21

regional policies and are therefore an important basis for
the Compliance department’s activities. — NfR
We ensure worldwide compliance with the Global Code
of Ethics via the Ethics Committee, which comprises the
heads of the Compliance, Corporate Audit and Human
Resources departments. The Ethics Committee meets
when it learns of new suspected violations to record them
and arrange for measures to be taken. In the event of
ser­ious breaches, such as suspected violations involving
child or forced labour, the Ethics Committee would be
immediately convened. If criminal violations occur, we
report them to the local authorities where appropriate. In
addition, violations are prosecuted under labour law. — NfR
We continuously examine the extent to which the Global
Code of Ethics and the Executive Board’s compliance
statement satisfy external compliance regulations and
update them if necessary. As a result of the international
social conversation on sexual harassment during the
year, we included it in the specific catalogue of prohibited
actions in 2018. — NfR

Supplier code of conduct
— 102-16, 308/103, 407/103, 414/103, 419/103

It is important to us that our business partners ascribe to
our values and behavioural principles. For this reason, we
require our suppliers to sign our supplier code of conduct
covering aspects such as the environment, employees,
observance of human rights and efforts to combat corruption and bribery. We offer them two options to minimise
the time and effort involved in reviewing the codes of
conduct, some of which are very detailed. Either they can
subscribe to the content of Hapag-Lloyd’s supplier code
of conduct or they can confirm that they possess their
own code of conduct which is consistent with our values
(see Supplier management, p. 70 f.). — NfR
Compliance training and reporting mechanisms
— 205-2, 205-3, 307-1, 406-1, 408-1, 409-1, 412-2, 419-1

We are able to ensure the targeted prevention of compliance violations by employing measures of our compliance
management system. For example, each of our landbased employees must take part in mandatory compliance
training. A whistle-blower system enables the submission
of anonymous tips about potential violations. Employees at
sea who work on vessels managed by our Fleet Management team receive information on the topic of compliance
via the “fleet circular”, a fleet newsletter. — NfR

A comprehensive training concept helps provide employees with the necessary knowledge and increase their
awareness of compliance. It comprises on-site and Webbased training. On-site training is divided into compliance
management training, regular on-site compliance training
and topic-specific compliance training. Corruption is a
major component of these sessions and one that we continue to develop. In addition, there are separate training
modules on the topic of competition law. — NfR
During the reporting period, almost all of Hapag-Lloyd’s
land-based personnel were trained in on-site compliance sessions. This includes all staff in the regions of
Latin America, North America, Asia and Europe, and the
majority of staff in the Middle East region as well as in the
headquarters. The employees from the remaining relevant
organisational units will receive on-site compliance training
in the coming year. — NfR
During the reporting period, we started developing a new
Web-based training programme that will feature content-related updates and increased interactivity. Following
the roll-out planned for 2019, the new Web-based training
programme will also be mandatory for Hapag-Lloyd’s
land-based employees worldwide. — NfR
We specifically encourage our staff to report compliance
violations, or suspected ones, to their superiors, their local
compliance officer or the central Compliance department.
They are assured that they will not be disadvantaged
by reporting violations of applicable law, regardless of
whether the violation proves to have occurred or not. The
same applies to business partners that report a potential
violation in good faith. — NfR
In almost all countries, we also have external contact partners to whom our staff and business partners can report
violations. This ensures that whistle-blowers can maintain
their neutrality and anonymity. In addition, discussions are
held in the local language and representatives have the
necessary expertise to proceed competently with a report,
thereby reducing the barriers to whistle-blowing. These
reports are consequently forwarded to the Compliance
department, in anonymised format if necessary. — NfR

C O R P O R AT E G O V E R N A N C E A N D C O M P L I A N C E | H A PA G - L L O Y D

No significant violations in the areas of corruption, discrimination or child and forced labour were reported via this
system in the reporting period. — NfR
Dealing with violations — 205-3, 206-1, 307-1, 406-1, 419-1
If there is indication of a compliance violation, we follow
up immediately by convening the Ethics Committee. The
Ethics Committee implements individual measures to
address the issue (e.g. an investigation by Corporate Audit
or external specialists). — NfR
All suspected cases are carefully reviewed as part of the
investigation. Where there is conclusive evidence of a
suspected violation and this can be legally verified, the
necessary legal or disciplinary measures are initiated. During the reporting year, there were suspected violations that
involved criminal activities. Of these, one case related to
an active member of staff. However, no legally admissible
evidence could be determined in this case. — NfR — 205-3,

fair share to society”. Our strategy pursues clearly defined
principles:
–	Transparent dialogue with stakeholders, particularly with
the relevant tax authorities
–	Strict compliance with all legal requirements regarding
the relevant country-specific tax situation
–	Punctual and correct payment of all corporate taxes,
under consideration of the protective effect of any bilateral agreements for the avoidance of double taxation on
corporate earnings
–	Rejection of artificial company structures created solely
for the purpose of lowering the tax burden
–	Transparency with regard to our necessary operational
presence in low-tax countries

206-1

If employees are found to have committed violations, this
can lead to sanctions under employment law, such as an
official warning. If a gross violation occurs, the employee’s contract may be terminated, the matter reported
to the relevant authorities or other legal steps taken. In
the event of a serious, confirmed violation by a business
partner, we reserve the right to terminate our relationship
with the business partner immediately. — NfR

RESPONSIBLE TAX POLICY
Our principles for a responsible tax policy
Responsible tax policies are coming under greater scrutiny
in international corporations. Part of this is due to increasingly stringent legal requirements, though increasing public
awareness is also playing a role. Due to events such as
the Panama Papers and public investigations into the tax
policies of conglomerates, public perception of this issue
is highly critical.
As a traditional company, Hapag-Lloyd is aware of its
responsibility to ensure fair and transparent company
taxation and acts according to the principle of “paying its

–	Implementation of structures and processes to ensure
permanent monitoring and compliance with legal
requirements with regard to company taxation (tax compliance management)
Tax compliance management system
As a result of its global business activities, Hapag-Lloyd
is liable to pay taxes in many countries and is subject to
highly heterogeneous regulatory requirements. Within
the context of the tightening of German criminal tax law,
companies are, for example, now obliged to implement
a tax compliance management system. The more stringent regulations mean that even insufficient tax payments
caused through negligence may still lead to the legal
representative of the company being held personally liable.
With the implementation of this kind of system, the company executives meet the increased demands in terms
of the company’s internal tax organisation, the selection
of suitable specialists and the ongoing monitoring of
company processes with regard to compliance with legal
requirements in tax matters (duties of due diligence and
control).
Hapag-Lloyd started implementing its tax compliance
management system in 2018. In doing so, Hapag-Lloyd

24

will base its system on the internal control system (ICS)
already existing and integrate the monitoring of tax processes into this system. These kinds of extensive, legally
mandated tax control systems are by no means standard
everywhere in the world. Hapag-Lloyd meets very high
standards in terms of control and compliance with the
requirements of tax law.
Alongside the traditionally complex German tax law,
requirements in terms of transparency and documentation are also increasing in other countries such as the
UK, where the publication of a company’s tax policy or
strategy is mandatory.

Country-by-country reporting
Since Hapag-Lloyd is active around the world and its
Group revenue exceeds EUR 750 million, the Company is
subject to new requirements on the disclosure of certain
country-specific corporate indicators, known as country-by-country reporting. This legal reporting requirement
for the mutual disclosure of information draws on the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) initiatives under the BEPS (base erosion
and profit shifting) programme. Hapag-Lloyd is in full
observance of the legal requirements for submitting country-by-country reports in the national headquarters of its
Group parent company (Germany). As such, ­Hapag-Lloyd
reports transparently about all of its company results and
tax payments in the countries in which it is represented by
its affiliates.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

— 401/103

We want to be an efficient service provider for our customers and a responsible employer for our staff. With a wide range of training opportunities, we strengthen the
leadership and specialist expertise of our employees and offer our young talents a
positive environment for their career development. In doing so, we value a positive
corporate culture and a healthy and safe working environment. — NfR

As a global employer, our human resources (HR) management is often faced with a very diverse range of challenges. One that we are confronted with in many countries
is staff quality management. At the same time, the requirements of ship crews are increasing all the time as ships
get larger. We are increasingly drawing on digital training
tools in order to ensure that our crews can reliably provide
the necessary services even as ships increase in size. In
Germany, as in other countries, we are actively countering
the lack of qualified staff with targeted recruitment campaigns.
We want to raise awareness of our Company among well­
qualified staff worldwide and to ensure that our employees
remain enthusiastic about our Company for the long term.
We do this by presenting ourselves as a future-oriented,
modern employer that is still aware of its heritage, implementing numerous measures to boost our appeal as
an employer (see Employee recruitment and retention, ​
p. 28 ff.).

ORGANISATION OF HUMAN
RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
The remit of the HR management team is to ensure that
there are globally uniform standards for the relevant
employee issues and to provide appropriate support to
our regional units in their own HR activities. — NfR
The HR department at our headquarters is responsible
for our employees on land. It is divided into a German HR
­Management department and an international ­Corporate
HR department. A third department, Marine Human
Resources (Marine HR), is responsible for our employees
at sea. — NfR

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

The HR Management department is responsible for all
staff-­related matters, including needs assessments, job
advertisements, interviews, contract preparation, and
internal transfers and departures for Germany. HR Management also manages business and commercial training
for the land-based organisation. — NfR
The Corporate HR department looks after our expatriates
and is responsible for the application of global policies
and guidelines. These are also implemented in the marine
division if appropriate and legally possible. Corporate HR
takes care of all employee development measures for the
German organisation, including advice, coaching, training
and chairing, as well as international development programmes, such as the Talent Development Programme
(TDP) and the Agile Leadership Programme at Hapag-Lloyd
(ALPHA). The department is on hand to advise the
regional HR managers where necessary. Regular global
HR conference calls are set up to answer questions from
the various regions in the presence of the other regions.
Corporate HR also manages the Global Staff Dialogue
(GSD) (see Training and further education, p. 32 ff.) and
coordinates the worldwide remuneration structures for
employees and management. Following the merger with
UASC (United Arab Shipping Company), the necessary
adjustments and standardisation of employment contracts
were completed during the reporting period. — NfR
The Marine HR department is in charge of HR matters
pertaining to the sea-based organisation, the planning
and implementation of training and further education
programmes and certifications (see Health and safety,
p. 37 ff.). The HR Management and Marine HR departments advise company management and managers on
HR issues and work with the co-determination bodies.
Marine HR also worked on standardising its processes

MANAGEMENT APPROACH | EMPLOYEES

during the reporting period so that it is now able to offer
standardised training across the regions, for example. — NfR
The HR departments of the individual regions are linked
to Corporate HR based on a dotted-line principle. They
are responsible for HR management at regional level, are
in direct communication with the HR departments at the
local sites and manage the implementation of employee
development measures at the local level. — NfR
The HR department coordinates the key topics and targets for HR management with the Executive Board. In
addition, the HR department is regularly audited by the
Corporate Audit department and the global Compliance
department. The Marine HR department is subject to the
ISM Code1 (see Safe ship operations, p. 40 ff.) as well as
annual internal and external audits. — NfR

EMPLOYEES | EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION

EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION
Recruiting well-qualified staff and ensuring their long-term loyalty to the company is
the prime goal of our HR management strategy. As an attractive employer, we also
offer appealing employee benefits, measures to reconcile career and family life, and
support programmes for young professionals, where local conditions allow.

   

EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT
We generally recruit young people via an apprenticeship
or study programme. We want to not only train them well
but also encourage their long-term loyalty to the company
through development measures and career options.
In Germany, more and more young people are choosing
to study. At the same time, the number of people looking
for a classic apprenticeship in order to join the workforce
after school is declining. Recruiting young professionals is
especially hard in the field of IT because the competition
is so fierce. In order to cover our requirements effectively,
we take part in various career orientation events. We also
increasingly use digital recruitment channels in order to
inform the target group actively about the possibilities of
the different apprenticeships at Hapag-Lloyd.

As an argument for choosing Hapag-Lloyd as an
employer, we communicate the company’s internal
employee benefits, which we offer our staff in addition
to their salaries. In addition, we also promise a pleasant
working environment and promote an appropriate work –
life balance (see Employee retention, p. 29 ff.).
As part of our efforts to develop new young employees,
we work closely with the Hamburg School of Business
Administration (HSBA) and the Nordakademie, where we
are represented on the Employers’ Advisory Council. We
offer four places on a combined vocational training and
degree programme at the Nordakademie and eight at the
HSBA. At the HSBA, we participate in the company working group as well as in business speed dating and informational events. We also support the ­accreditation/reaccreditation of its courses and international p
­ rogrammes
such as the HSBA summer school.
As the issue of reconciling a career with family life is
becoming more and more important to young people and
those joining the workforce, we have to be able to ensure
that a career in seafaring remains attractive in the future,
despite a tough market environment. We specifically target
young talent at fairs, on career portals and in face-to-face
meetings. Once we have recruited suitable employees,
our goal is to retain them at our Company in the long
term. During the reporting period, we transitioned almost
all newly hired EU sailors on our ships under the German
flag to permanent contracts and removed time limitations
on existing contracts.

EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION | EMPLOYEES

The majority of our seafaring staff, who are managed by
Fleet Management in Hamburg, remain with the company
after the completion of their apprenticeships. The path
to management level following an apprenticeship always
requires a course of study. In exceptional cases, we have
responded to instances of low numbers of apprentices or
returning graduates by hiring nautical and technical watch
officers externally. We continue to recruit chief engineers
and captains only by supporting and promoting our own
young professionals.

insurance, voluntary accident insurance that exceeds statutory protection, and pension and life assurance options.
We also provide our staff with in-house company restaurants or pantries for preparing and eating their own
food. Alternatively, we offer other kinds of assistance
with meals. In Germany, we also provide capital-forming
benefits, an extra month’s salary, paid leave in certain
situations, such as after the birth of a child or the death of
a parent, and assistance in emergency situations through
the Präsident-Achelis-Elisabeth-Wiegand-Stiftung foundation.

EMPLOYEE RETENTION
We offer our staff around the world attractive benefits to
supplement their employment contracts.
Social benefits
An important instrument in this regard are the attractive
social benefits that are specific to different countries and
regions. Unlike in Germany, for example, statutory health
insurance for general health care in some countries is
insufficient for our employees on land. We compensate
for this, where possible, with additional voluntary health

We want to offer our staff around the world a modern,
attractive workplace. We set a new standard in this regard
during the reporting year with our newly opened Quality
Service Center in Suzhou, China. Even while choosing the
location, we took into account its attractiveness to staff
with regard to living costs and infrastructure, among other
things. The layout of the new office building with its workstations also provides sufficient space to receive visitors,
hold meetings and conduct training events. The modern
concept was rounded off with coffee and lunch areas.
Supporting sea-based employees
We draw on a wide range of measures to promote the
­loyalty of our seafaring staff on our ships. For instance, we
conduct one-to-one meetings with the captains after each
stint at sea on our ships registered under the German flag,
as we do regularly with any employee who requests them.
These meetings cover the technical side of the journey,
the performance of the employee and further deployment
planning, taking social aspects into account. Together, we
discuss systems and processes that could improve the
working environment, regarding the increasing administrative burden, for example.
Our crew managers look after the employees at sea from
their workstations on land. In this context, we insist that
the crew managers are highly qualified and always reach­
able by the crew. Many of these crew managers have
gone to sea themselves and can therefore contribute a
great deal of experience and knowledge.

30

EMPLOYEES | EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION

We also set great store by the relationships between staff
on land and at sea. We strengthen these relationships
with a mutual starter week for apprentices, for example.
Our staff can regularly visit Hapag-Lloyd ships to gain a
better understanding of the work done by their colleagues
at sea.

S TA F F

Every manager, whether on land or at sea, is required to
assess how satisfied employees are in their day-to-day
roles and to take suitable action if needed. Our management staff are supported by the HR departments, which
help with the organisation of suitable team-building measures, for example.

Work – life balance — 401/103, 401-3
Only when a sense of balance between work life and
home life is achieved are our staff able to develop their
full potential. For this reason, the HR departments and
local managers work together to develop measures that
also exceed statutory requirements and that enable our
employees to reconcile the demands of their work and
personal life. We have established a parent/child office
at our headquarters, for example. Outside of Germany,
we also offer flexitime and other working time arrangements if this is legally possible and compatible with work
processes.
During the reporting period, we revised our Global Mobility Policy (formerly our Expat Policy), which regulates the
deployment of staff abroad. As a global company, we
aim to prepare for postings abroad, as well as carrying
them out and ending them, in a fair and transparent
way. It is particularly important to us that we provide
professional advice, preparation and support for our
staff in doing so. We also adhere to defined standards in
terms of remuneration, employee benefits and support
services (for example, with regard to tax law) and provide ad­equate safeguards. Family members who will be
joining the staff member are also taken into account.

For our crew in particular, long periods away from their
families and social networks, irregular working hours,
seven-day working weeks and limited leisure options are
especially challenging. For this reason, we introduced
flexitime and relatively short deployment times on our
ships under the German flag. Where possible, we also
take into account personal requests such as holiday
planning when drawing up our rosters, provided sufficient
notice is given. In addition, family members of the crew,
such as spouses, partners or children, are allowed to
travel on board with them.
Co-determination — 102-41
The opportunity for employees to take part in important
decision-making processes and suggest their own ideas
has a positive impact on employee retention. Works
councils and similar bodies in Germany and other countries enable employee and employer representatives to
communicate in a confidential and constructive manner. In
principle, however, all employees can make suggestions
on improvements.
Our management staff throughout Europe work together
closely with the national works councils. In Germany,
the works council plays a significant role in the implementation of a wide range of topics, such as integration,

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION | EMPLOYEES

restructuring, reorganisation or agreements on employee
review systems. In other countries, works councils (mainly
Europe) or similar bodies (Latin America and the west
coast of the US) also usually have co-determination and/
or information rights in the event of reorganisations and
mergers if they will result in job changes or job losses.
Fair pay and salaries — 102-12, 102-13
Paying our staff a fair wage is a key element in providing
an attractive working environment. We are member of the
employers’ association Hamburg Shipowners’ Association
(Verein Hamburger Rheder), which in turn is a member of
the collective bargaining community that concludes contracts for employees of the Hamburg Transport Industry.
The Community of Employers’ Associations has made
independent pay agreements with the service workers’
union ver.di for our land-based staff in Germany. These
agreements cover minimum working conditions and minimum wages, among other things. As per Section 5 (3) of
the German Works Constitution Act (BetrVG), senior executives are not covered by these agreements.
The crew members on our ships under the German
flag are represented by the marine works council. They
are covered by independent pay agreements which we
have entered into with ver.di and the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) through our membership
in the collective bargaining community of the German

31

Shipowners’ Association (VDR). During the reporting
period, there were collective bargaining agreements with
the VDR and ver.di on 16 March 2018, which led to a twophase increase in the HTV (seafarers’ collective bargaining
agreement) for 1 September 2018 and 1 January 2020.
There were agreements negotiated during the reporting
period and due to come into force on 1 January 2019
regarding the planned expansion of contracts with the
ITF. In addition, we apply the regulations of the Maritime
Labour Convention (MLC).
When calculating and agreeing on remuneration in line
with duties, performance and the market in general, it is
irrelevant to us whether the employee is male or female.
The equal treatment of women and men means that gender cannot, of course, be a factor in determining salaries.
Under our Global Code of Ethics, we are committed to
complying with all local guidelines on working times,
minimum wages and fair pay throughout the Group. We
also endeavour to expand our social partnership with
employee representative organisations.
A total of 58% of all employees (Hapag-Lloyd AG: 95%)
are covered by collective bargaining agreements (as at 31

Global Staff Dialogue — 404-3
The Global Staff Dialogue (GSD) is an annual discussion
between employees on land and managers, where developments during the year are discussed, joint work and
development targets are set and suitable measures for
further employee development are agreed upon. These
are then implemented by the HR department through, for
example, advanced training such as MS Office courses,
training on travel safety and intercultural skills, and customised team-building activities. Global Business Support
also offers global Web-based training, including on sustainability topics. — NfR
The GSD serves to gauge the potential of employees for
their career objectives and to develop the staff on this
basis by working with the management. The discussions
have enjoyed good feedback so far, but we will in future
put the focus on dialogue and will further improve the
user-friendliness of the documentation software. — NfR
An internal project team is currently working on selecting a learning management system, which will enable
the measures agreed through the GSD to be managed
and followed up in a consistent system among other
things. — NfR
Talent Development Programme
Our three-year Talent Development Programme (TDP) is
managed locally by the regions and aimed at employees
on land whose performance is excellent and whose
potential for development is regarded by us as high. The
TDP provides our employees worldwide with support on
both an individual and collective level, and they are mentored by instructors from the areas of HR management
and development. — NfR
Agile Leadership Programme at Hapag-Lloyd
The Agile Leadership Programme at Hapag-Lloyd (ALPHA)
was implemented in 2018 as the successor to the
Manage­ment Career Programme (MCP). The international

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

develop­ment programme, managed centrally in Hamburg,
is tailored to management staff working on land. Within the
shorter duration of three years instead of six, a new area of
focus is addressed each year:
1. Self-reflection and resulting skill sets,
2. Leadership skills and
3. Entrepreneurial strategy and actions.

— NfR

During the reporting period, the first opening event (Spotlight Week) and an ALPHA management training event
took place. Initial training sessions on agile methods and
techniques to boost creativity, such as design thinking,
were held. — NfR
Agile methods
In these times of increasing complexity and decreasing
predictability, agility, i.e. our ability to take active, fast action,
is extremely important. Consequently, agile methods are a
fixed element of the development programmes for our
management staff. The significance of these methods
becomes clear in our daily work. For example, an agile
project management method known as “scrum” is already
being used by our IT team in the areas of software development and the implementation of processes.
Expertise management system — 404-3
We want to ensure that the crews on board our ships
also have access to targeted professional and personal
development. To this end, we have implemented an
expertise management system on ships registered under
the German flag. In regular dialogue with their superiors,
the management and employee work out their individual
development requirements and agree on suitable training measures. This results in an ongoing expansion of
avail­able training sessions. We thus initiated training on
the topics of bunkers, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and
MACS33 during the reporting period alone. A special
focus was also given to training in BASSnet, an electronic
HR management system used for crew scheduling. Fleet
Management is currently working on rolling out BASSnet
across the fleet. Corresponding advanced training measures will then be implemented by the Marine HR department. — NfR

OPEN CORPORATE CULTURE
As a traditional Hamburg company, our corporate culture is shaped by Hanseatic
­v alues. We want to uphold these throughout the Group while promoting cultural
and social diversity within our staff. After all, that’s what makes working at
­H apag-Lloyd special.

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
— 405/103, 406/103

With offices on all five continents, diversity among our
staff plays a central role for us. It is part of our everyday
lives. Our employees come from various cultures. They
bring differing social backgrounds and very different ways
of thinking, perspectives and experiences to our Company. We see this as an enrichment and something to
be cherished. We are convinced that this is what brings
our Company forward at every level. In our day-to-day
communication, we benefit from these cultural, social and
linguistic differences and achieve better results over the
long term thanks to the varying approaches and perspectives. Furthermore, our employees develop a better
understanding and greater tolerance of distinctive cultural
features and differences, which also benefit them outside
the organisation.
The experience we garnered through the mergers with
CSAV (Compañía Sud Americana de Vapores) and UASC
(United Arab Shipping Company) in recent years has confirmed this belief. As a result of our open corporate culture,
the new manage­ment staff and employees were quickly

integrated into the company. But our new colleagues not
only add to our diversity – Hapag-Lloyd also benefits significantly from their experience and the standards that they
bring to us from other company environments.
“We are a truly global community”
In June 2018, we held an international football tournament
for our staff in order to further strengthen existing networks and promote a sense of belonging at Hapag-Lloyd.
More than 1,200 employees, representing all our regions
and about 40 countries, attended the two-day event in
Hamburg. The days were characterised by a sense of
fairness, openness and a shared passion for football and
international shipping. In this way, the event perfectly
encapsulated our identity as a “truly global community”.
Without the willingness to bridge cultural differences, to
find what unites us rather than divides us, and the ability to
develop shared enthusiasm, our business would founder.
Equal opportunities for all employees
— 102-12, 405/103, 406/103

We are expressly committed to the diversity recommendations of the Government Commission for the German
Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) and have firmly
incorporated the objectives of the Diversity Charter into
our corporate culture. We foster the talents of all our
employees, irrespective of gender, nationality, ethnic
origin, religion and ideology, disability, age, sexual orien­
tation and identity. We want to include people with disabilities in our operational workflows and the social life of our
Company in the same way we do any employee.
The selection and recruitment of new employees around
the world is based solely on qualifications, social skills
and their readiness and ability to perform the work. We
follow country-specific regulations in this respect, such
as the German General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG).

36

E M P L O Y E E S | O P E N C O R P O R AT E C U LT U R E

The selection of our seafaring staff is based on suitability
for working at sea, high flexibility and manual skills, for
example.
Women in management positions — 405-1
As at 31 December 2018, the proportion of women in
management positions (levels 2 to 3) was around 9%.
We want to continue to increase our employees’ and
managers’ awareness of the issue of diversity across the
Group through regular events, such as self-marketing for
women, the Women’s Business Talk, intercultural awareness simulation and other forms of intercultural training.
The Women’s Business Forum in Hamburg is particularly
successful. Since 2015, young female managers have
been offered opportunities for further training as part of
this initiative and can engage with experienced female
managers at the third and fourth management level.

COMMUNICATION BETWEEN EMPLOYER
AND EMPLOYEE
Within our Group, we set great store by ensuring a positive relationship between employees and employers. Flat
hierarchies, efficient decision-making pathways and easy
communication between the various management levels
are key elements of our corporate management strategy.
Our top management adheres to an open-door principle,
which means that any member of staff can approach any
executive at any time. We regularly hold the “Breakfast
with the Executive Board” in Hamburg, which employees
can sign up for. Events such as the weekly “Lunch with
the Management” enable our staff to get to know our
second- and third-tier management better.
We support a culture of feedback where open communication is expressly fostered, so that our employees
can learn from their mistakes. We train our managers to

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

provide prompt and regular feedback as well as to actively
request it. And naturally, we also ask our employees to
give feedback to their managers. The annual Global Staff
Dialogue provides a formal framework for discussions
between the management and land-based employees.
In order to strengthen the dialogue beyond the ­company
itself, we started working with the charity Common
­Purpose in 2018. One of its aims is to facilitate dialogue
beyond the professional arena for management staff in
Hamburg working in a variety of fields. This aims to not
only strengthen expertise within the participants’ relevant
core areas of work, but also to increase their understanding of how to shape communities. Within our joint Navigator programme, young professionals are offered a wide
range of learning and networking opportunities, where
they can enter into dialogue via a variety of formats and in
unusual locations – with each and other, and with around
40 external decision makers.
As part of the “Dialogue in Leadership and Management”
pilot project, two high-ranking members of the German
army are stationed with our Company for a long period of
time. One of the aims of this project is to ensure ongoing
dialogue among future civilian and military leaders. In add­
ition to providing familiarisation with different leadership
cultures and processes, this is a matter of contributing to
the performance of the army as a fixed and recognised
part of German society – by contributing to the development of course content at the army’s leadership academy,
for example.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

— 403-1, 403-8

No matter what area of work our staff are involved with, ensuring their health and
­s afety is our top priority. We continually work on developing our high standards in
terms of health and safety, e.g. by having our occupational health and safety management system (OHSAS 18001) externally certified. — NfR

Due to the importance of these topics, these issues
primarily rest with the HR department on land – both at
Group level and in the individual regions. Our management is also responsible for ensuring compliance with the
relevant regulations and for implementing internal guidelines. — NfR — 403-4

legal requirements, among other things. Furthermore,
decisions were made to create quiet rooms, provide
de­fib­rillators at the locations and adapt the furnishings in
line with legal and operational requirements among other
things. — NfR — 403-4
The company agreement decided upon in Germany in
2006 is evidence of our commitment to promoting health
and safety at work. We see the agreement as a guidance
framework enabling us to identify areas of action and to
implement measures to improve health promotion within
the Group. — NfR

Occupational health and safety on land and at sea
In Germany, we have established a Health and Safety
Committee, which meets regularly. The committee comprises representatives from the company management,
the health and safety officer, the company doctor, representatives of the Works Council and the safety officers.
In its meetings, the committee discusses topics relating
to occupational health and safety and agrees on areas
for action and measures to be implemented. One area of
focus for the committee in 2018 was “Psychological stress
in the workplace”. The company doctor and health and
safety officer were asked to develop a suitable process for
assessing health risks that took into account the stricter

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

Fleet Management, which ensures safe ship operations
around the world, is responsible for our employees at sea.
Compliance with our Group-wide standards for health and
safety at work is also mandatory on board our ships. We
have embedded these within operational workflows via our
safety management system (SMS), which encompasses
all our occupational safety processes and measures. We
document risks and the efficacy of our activities in ­hazard
assessments and reports such as our Occupational Health
Report for our ships under the German flag. — NfR
Areas of action can take two forms: preventive, such as
inspections, reports from our ships or the procurement of
the latest safety equipment, and corrective, such as accident investigations, reporting of near accidents, changes
to the law or the identification of hazards through research
and scientific studies. The results of the analyses are then
used to derive safety measures. — NfR — 403-2

M A N A G E M E N T A P P R O A C H | H E A LT H A N D S A F E T Y

Certified health and safety management system
The fleet health and safety management system was
audited in May 2018 by BG-Verkehr. Following two
intensive audits, BG-Verkehr confirmed our compliance
with internationally recognised standards. As a result of
the voluntary audit, all of the ships managed by Fleet
Management have been certified in accordance with
the standards of the ILO-OSH 2001 guideline and to
OHSAS 18001:2007.

39

The certification confirms our successful and ongoing
commitment to occupational health and safety. As an
integral component of our safety management systems,
our health and safety management system makes a
major contribution towards ensuring that our seafaring
staff have a safe and healthy working environment. The
active involvement of our staff on board in the quarterly
health and safety committee is a major factor in the
­success and acceptance of the system. The regular
feedback received from those on board is used to derive
the relevant potential improvements and to continu­ally
develop our system.

SAFE SHIP OPERATIONS

— 403-8

Our Fleet Management sets great store by the safe operation of our ships because
only then are we able to guarantee the safety of our staff and cargo, and protect the
environment. We draw on numerous measures, some of which go above and beyond
the legal requirements, and implement them consistently. — NfR

The safety management system
Within our safety management system (SMS), we have
among other things defined four areas of focus that represent the goals of our safety and environmental protection
policy: — NfR
– S
 afety on board: Within our safety management ­system,
we have established a comprehensive package of
preventive measures and actions, from technical stateof-the-art standards to operational workflows. It is our
aim to guarantee the safety of people and our ships, as
well as the cargo and our property. — NfR
– O
 ccupational health and safety: We draw on an extensive and appropriate range of precautions and safety
measures in order to minimise as effectively as possible
the risks to human life and health that result from operating a ship. — NfR
– M
 aritime security: With effective security systems that
prevent non-authorised persons from gaining access,
for example, we can identify and minimise the risk of
outside attacks. — NfR
– E
 nvironmental protection: Our safety systems also
include measures that enable us to avoid or minimise
pollution. — NfR
Our managers and staff are committed to our safety
and environmental protection policy, which is a major
prerequis­ite for an efficient implementation of the SMS.
We have established clear processes and principles to
ensure that our employees are not only familiar with the
content of the policy, but that they apply this policy, along

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

with the SMS and other standards and guidelines within
their area of responsibility, at all times. — NfR — 403-2, 403-5
Regular revisions of the SMS help us to ensure that it
always takes into account the results of the management
review, as well as any changes in the law. All incidents,
accidents and near-misses on our ships are documented.
The findings from the documentation influence our decisions about how we can improve operational processes.
We then communicate our decisions to the ships affected.
The ships implement the measures and we check them.
In 2018, the SMS was communicated to part of the fleet
solely in electronic form for the first time as part of our
digitalisation process. — NfR — 403-2
Audits
Internal and external audits help to ensure that we comply
with all legal and internal requirements in terms of occupational health and safety. We check compliance with
ISM and ISPS codes1, as well as ISO, OHSAS and MLC2
guidelines, every year through internal audits of all of our
ships. External ISM, ISPS and MLC audits are carried
out on each of our ships every two-and-a-half years.
ISO 9001 and 14001 audits are carried out regularly on a
set number of ships. — NfR
In addition to the ships themselves, their management is
also audited by the flag states or classification societies.
As was the case in previous years, the Fleet Management

Port state control
Every port state is permitted to check any ships docked
in its ports without giving notice to establish whether the
ships are in compliance with the applicable international
agreements on occupational health and safety regulations which the port state has ratified. During the port
state controls (PSCs), the port state examines the ships’
condition and equipment and checks that they are being
operated properly by their crews. — NfR
Several countries in nine regions so far have agreed to
port state controls and signed memoranda of understanding (MoU) to this effect. These regional PSC organisations also conduct concentrated inspection campaigns
for certain key issues. In 2018, these included “Auxiliary
­Machinery” (Viña del Mar MoU), “MARPOL Annex VI”
(­Paris, Tokyo, Indian Ocean and Black Sea MoU) and
“Open Lifeboats (US flag vessels only)” (USCG). — NfR
In 2018, 272 PSCs were conducted on our ships and an
average of 0.67 deficiencies were identified. The comparison with the average global deficiency rates (e. g. Paris
MoU 2.23 (2018) and Tokyo MoU 2.43 (2017)) and the
positive development of our deficiency rates in recent
years are evidence of the success of our SMS. — NfR

Accolade from the US Coast Guard
In 2018, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) awarded our Fleet Management and its ships with acceptance
into its Qualship 21 programme. This confirms that
Hapag-Lloyd operates in compliance with international
standards and US laws and regulations to the very highest degree. Fewer than one in ten ships operating in US
waters under foreign flags manage to fulfil the high quality
and safety requirements to make the cut.
The award is partly due to the exceptional results
achieved in the port state controls which were carried out.
The accolade also means that the regular USCG checks
on board must now take place only once every three years
rather than every year, as was previously the case.

Crisis management
In the event of a crisis, our Emergency Manual serves
as a guide to avoiding or minimising harm to people, our
ships and the company. We have established the following
priorities in the manual: — NfR
1. Save lives
2. Save the ship
3. Protect the environment
4. Prevent damage to the Company

— NfR

Our Emergency Response Team (ERT) comprises representatives and experts from all the relevant Hapag-Lloyd
departments, as well as representatives from external
institutions. In the event of an incident, we have at our disposal a team with all of the relevant expertise to properly
coordinate the situation and provide the necessary help
if required. The team is contactable around the clock for
our ships and for charter ships. We have also established
clear areas of responsibility and notification channels so
that the Executive Board can also be informed as quickly
as possible in the event of a crisis. — NfR

43

Piracy and terrorism
We cannot foresee incidents relating to piracy and, in
particular, terrorism. Basic guidelines on risk avoidance,
such as the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO)
Best Management Practices for Protection against Somalia Based Piracy (BMP), are available. However, there
is no consensus on which regions pose which risks and
how these risks might best be countered. For us, this
means that we have to gauge each situation individually.
In this context, we also draw on various independent
sources of information to give us a comprehensive picture of risks in the areas we travel through. For example,
during the reporting period, we received information that
the number of incidents in the Gulf of Aden are continuing
to decrease.
Our ships follow the recommendations of the BMP as
a matter of course. In addition, we perform ship- and
route-specific risk assessments for every ship based on
the independent sources of information. We evaluate
and update these assessments regularly – at least once
a year – in order to ensure that we can react to any
­changes immediately.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
The requirements of Hapag-Lloyd to ensure the health and safety of its staff vary
depending on the employee’s field of work and location. We develop tailored
preventive and corrective measures to ensure the long-term ability of our employees
to work. — NfR

OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY
The majority of our staff works at desks, where there is a
very low risk of injury or illness. Employees who work in
facility management or in kitchens, warehouses or ports,
as well as employees on business trips, receive training
from us in accordance with the specific requirements and
risks. Business trips, for example, involve different safety
risks depending on the destination, and we address these
as part of travel safety training. Since 2017, our staff
around the world have been able to call a central emergency number when required. — NfR — 403-3
Ongoing improvements to fire protection
With the aid of the updated building control system at our
headquarters in Hamburg, potential risks, such as the failure of air-conditioning systems or smoke extraction units,
can now be identified much more quickly. By alerting the
security staff and emergency services simultaneously, we
ensure that the hazards are dealt with as quickly as possible. In addition, we always ensure that we continue to
improve our fire protection systems with every renovation
or conversion project. For instance, new fire protection
doors were installed in the cellar of our headquarters and
new emergency lighting in an annexe.
Selected staff members are trained as first-aiders and
department representatives in the event of a fire or accident. Regular fire extinguisher practice is held for department representatives and in-house first-aid training for the
first-aiders. — 403-3

Specific risks in ship operations
There are specific risks associated with ship operations,
including stress caused by noise and by travel through
different time zones and climates. There is also a risk of
accidents associated with working with ropes and in shifts
(see Safe ship operations, p. 40 ff.). — NfR
Workplace accidents in 2018
We record and investigate safety-relevant incidents
throughout the Group. In order to continually improve
occupational health and safety and to avoid accidents, we
develop and implement appropriate measures. In 2018,
approximately 11.6 occupational accidents* per 1,000
employees (Hapag-Lloyd AG: 16.1) were reported for
sea-based operations. Approximately 2.5 occupational
accidents* per 1,000 employees (Hapag-Lloyd AG: 0.9)
involving our employees on land were recorded. In 2018,
there were no fatal accidents either on land or at sea.*

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH

— 403-6

On land, the greatest health risks include lack of physical
activity, postural damage, vision disorders and psycho­
logical stress. In order to actively counter these risks,
we have launched a wide range of measures to promote
health and prevent illness. For example, Hapag-Lloyd
sponsors the company health insurance fund pronova
BKK and is represented on its Administrative Board. This
enables us to actively contribute to the structure and
orientation of the health insurer, working with it to develop
and implement measures to promote health and medical
check-ups for our staff in Germany.
One of the measures, which aims to include all staff in
Germany, is at least one sports-related campaign every
year in the summer. During the reporting year, it was the
“Bewegt zur Arbeit” (Active Commute) campaign, as well
as the promotion of screenings for colorectal and skin
cancer and the flu vaccination. The regular, free services
are supplemented by a wide range of fee-based sports
offered through our Company sports club, which was

45

founded in Hamburg in 1953 and has around 500 members. Employees also have the option of making massage
appointments at the company facilities.
Focusing on prevention — 403-6
Since 2017, and in partnership with pronova BKK, we
have also been offering health awareness days once or
twice a year, where staff are informed about workplace
design, ergonomics and preventive measures. The staff
are also informed via online tutorials about topics such
as occupational safety. In 2018, the topic of the health
awareness day in Germany was mindfulness. The programme included talks with exercises, as well as beginners’ yoga. Fee-based courses on primary prevention
were offered for the first time in 2018, with the costs
reimbursed by the health insurer upon regular attendance.
Further primary prevention courses, including other areas
of focus, are planned for the future. A new programme
called “Health after work” was also launched, which
provides free health talks that take place outside working
hours and cover topics like eye health. Regular participant
questionnaires help us to adapt the programme to the

needs of employees. We also carry out similar preventive
measures in other regions and areas.
At our office in Hamburg, staff can take advantage of
additional health-related offerings which are developed
and provided by our Company doctors. These include, for
example, first aid for acute symptoms, risk factor assessment by means of blood testing, and individual counselling
on health and nutrition, including psychological health and
addictions. We also provide our employees with vaccin­
ations, free of charge. For private travel, the only fee
charged is for the vaccine itself. This offer is very popular
with our employees.

Globally, we always adapt the health care initiatives that
we have developed and implemented to specific regional
requirements. For example, Austrian employee protection
law requires us to evaluate psychological stress in the
workplace. As a result of the analysis, we held a workshop
on effective ways to reduce and manage stress for all
staff at the site. During the reporting period, comparable
laws and activities surrounding psychological stress in the

Health management at sea
One particular challenge for our health management team
is the medical care of our employees at sea. We therefore take specific measures to protect the health of our
employees at sea. In order to be able to work aboard our
ships, an employee’s fitness for naval service, for example, must be determined; the requirements of which are
defined in accordance with the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC), among others, in the Maritime Labour Act. The
fitness for naval service is confirmed by certificates and
continuously monitored with the aid of software.
Preventive measures such as medical check-ups and
­voluntary vaccinations also minimise the health risks to
seafaring employees. In 2018, we administered numerous
vaccinations worldwide and trained our cooks in healthy
eating on board. Our high technical communication standards on board allow us to provide medical care with the
help of land-based medical centres. We continually work
on improving and expanding our care services in this
area. — 403-6
Risk assessment for psychological stress
During the reporting period, we began rolling out a risk
assessment for mental stress (RAMS). With the planned
2019 RAMS roll-out to include all seafaring personnel
employed by Fleet Management, Hapag-Lloyd is going far
above and beyond international legal requirements. The
key areas of focus here will be external factors (stressors)
such as the work environment, work content and organisation, as well as social relationships. Additionally, the
RAMS model will examine the effects of these stressors
on people (strain), even if they are of secondary import­
ance because they are difficult to influence. The project
actively involves the seafaring staff in the form of questionnaires and workshops, so that the assessment of results
and the development of structural measures can be
carried out in partnership with the staff. We hope that this
project will improve the working conditions of our seafarers and thereby reduce their stress. We are convinced
that this active contribution to health and satisfaction will
further increase motivation while reducing the number of
employee absences and turnover.

DANGEROUS GOODS

47

— 306/103, 403-7

As an international service provider, we also transport goods that are classed as
hazardous. When transporting dangerous goods, we implement special measures in
order to ensure the safety of our staff, ships and the environment. We ensure that
our staff on land and sea work in strict compliance with all valid laws and internal
regulations. — NfR

  

For the transportation of dangerous goods, our most
important principle is that we do not transport any dangerous goods unless they meet all international, national and
local laws and guidelines in full. These include the IMDG
Code3, 49 CFR (US regulations), the German Ordinance
on the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Sea (GGVSee)
and the German Dangerous Goods Officer Ordinance
(GbV). Apart from these, there is a range of additional laws
and regulations which apply to specific modes of transport
and which we adhere to. — NfR
Various aspects of a particular good are used to identify
the potential danger that it exhibits. These include its
dangerous goods class, global UN number, chemical
compos­ition, the external temperature and its moisture
content. The hazard potential determines the specific
requirements for transport. — NfR
Regulations and processes
The transport of hazardous material poses complex challenges. We counter these challenges through additional
regulations based on the “rules of good seafaring” that
go above and beyond the law. For example, in order to
protect the staff and cargo in the event of a fire, no dangerous goods may be stored in front of or behind the staff
quarters on board. This also applies to the outward sides
of the ships, to protect the cargo from being struck by
waves, pirate attacks or ship collisions. — NfR
All regulations and work processes relating to dangerous
goods are detailed in our Hapag-Lloyd Dangerous Goods
Manual. This manual is used by our dangerous goods

experts as well as by all relevant parties, such as ship
planners and Port Terminal Operations. One section of the
manual covers the Restricted List, which lists all the goods
that we do not transport for risk-related reasons though it
would be legally permissible to do so. If a risk assessment
changes, this special section of the manual is updated.
We will inform the dangerous goods experts immediately
in writing or via a meeting of any changes to the manual or
the Restricted List. — NfR
Our dangerous goods experts in the regions are respon­
sible for ensuring the proper handling of dangerous goods
in the ports and on ships. They examine every single
dangerous good to check that it complies with statutory
requirements and that it is loaded on board in accordance
with the applicable laws, reporting regularly to the central
Hapag-Lloyd dangerous goods officer. — NfR
The Cargo Patrol System
One feature of the dangerous goods management system
that we have established as a shipping company is our
systematic keyword-based search for undeclared dangerous goods. Our Cargo Patrol System, as it is called, has
received several international awards. We declined transport on more than 3,900 occasions in 2018 as a result of
undeclared dangerous goods. It is our long-term aim to
continue to improve safety in the transport chain beyond
the bounds of our Company. In partnership with IBM, we
therefore want to make Cargo Patrol accessible to our
competitors as well. — NfR

Dangerous goods training
Our employees who deal with dangerous goods, such as
captains and cargo officers, receive regular training by the
Hapag-Lloyd dangerous goods officer in line with IMDG,
the German Ordinance on the Transport of Dangerous
Goods by Sea (GGVSee) and 49 CFR. We are convinced
that well-trained staff will recognise even more irregular­
ities or causes for concern. — NfR

Since
2012: zero
reportable accidents involving dangerous goods — NfR

From 2013 to 2018, Hapag-Lloyd transported over two
million TEU of dangerous goods. Since January 2012,
there has been no reportable accident involving dangerous goods transported by Hapag-Lloyd. — NfR —306-3

Initiatives and memberships —102-13
In 2011, carriers, insurers and experts came together to
create a cargo incident notification system (CINS) in order
to record and evaluate cargo or container accidents centrally in one database. This aims for early recognition of
positive developments and those requiring urgent action,
as well as improved operational safety at all stages of
transport. These goals are primarily achieved through the
transparent exchange of experiences and best practices
by members. Hapag-Lloyd is a founder of this initiative
and an active member of its Executive Board. — NfR
Challenges arising from leaks and misdeclarations are
addressed in this context. CINS wants to counter this by
compiling precise guidelines. We use our Cargo Patrol
findings to inform our competitors about cargoes with
false declar­ations. — NfR
We are also an active member of the Association of
­German Shipowners (Verband Deutscher Reeder) and
chair its hazardous goods committee. — NfR

and raises staff awareness of digital topics.
The hub is continually updated and expanded
with new topics.

DIGITALISATION
The introduction of digital solutions enables us to draw on efficiency potentials and
continue to improve the quality of our services. With our Strategy 2023, we are
continuing to pursue this path. Both within the company and with partners, we are
developing digital solutions to increase customer satisfaction and our commercial
success.

Digital systems have been helping us in our day-to-day
work for many years. Thanks to them, we are able to
improve quality for our customers and increase revenue,
all while reducing costs. We have been using the freight
information system FIS since the 1990s, for example. FIS
enables us to systematically record important data about
the cargo along the transport chain and to provide this
information to our business partners and customers.
Digital transformation supports Strategy 2023
Digitalisation plays a key role in the implementation of our
new Strategy 2023. We believe that ongoing improvements to existing systems and processes, as well as
the development of new, digitally available services and
business models, are vital to guaranteeing the best quality
possible, which is the basic requirement for satisfied
customers and positive growth. The Digital Channel and
Incubation Unit (DCIU), founded in 2017, supports the
regions and departments with the successful digitalisation of Hapag-Lloyd. It will assume important tasks in the
preparation and support of our digital transformation, also
guaranteeing that our staff are well informed and aware of
digital topics.
Improving customer satisfaction and efficiency
In 2018, we were able to noticeably improve our customer
service by updating the mobile app and launching Quick
Quotes. Quick Quotes makes it possible to enquire directly
about freight rates and book services online (see Customer
focus, p. 75 f.). In addition, we have initiated a pilot project
with customers that aims to facilitate the live tracking
of containers in future. We are also developing innovative
and efficient solutions with other external partners in order
to meet customer requirements.

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

Raising employee awareness through transparency
and communication
In future, we want to develop additional measures to further raise awareness among our staff for digital topics and
to make better use of the opportunities arising from digitalisation. To this end, we created the Digital Hub in 2018
– a Web-based internal platform for raising employee
awareness and promoting dialogue on digital topics and
internal and external developments. The Digital Hub
provides articles and other content, enabling employees
to actively take part in our digital growth with feedback or
ideas via a comment function.
We continue to work towards being able to conduct big
data analyses in future. This means that we will be able to
draw conclusions quickly from large amounts of data and
use the findings. We are currently creating the technical
and structural requirements for this through a data lake
project. We also work together with external partners on
blockchain solutions, i.e. on the decentralised, transparent
logging of processes.
A look at the trends in employee numbers in the DCIU
reveals the great significance of these topics for us. In the
reporting period, the number of staff increased from three
to 14. For next year, we are already planning for at least
19 employees in the Digital Channel and Incubation Unit.

ROUTE OPTIMISATION
We continually strive to optimise our route planning in order to guarantee the e
­ fficient
and punctual operation of our fleet. Seasonal weather conditions, for instance,
­influence our planning just as much as the ship’s berthing time in the port. Using
­d igital solutions, we can record and analyse the relevant data in order to stay abreast
of important developments and to be able to make the best possible decisions for
our routes. — NfR

Digital solutions at the Fleet Support Center
While the focus for the digital solutions described above is
on the processes on the customer side and on supporting the digital revolution in the company as a whole, the
Fleet Support Center (FSC) has been acting as an interface for topics relating to ship operations since 2013. For
ex­ample, the FSC manages topics where responsibilities
have not yet been clearly defined, and where regions and
departments have pursued a range of approaches. This
is the case with cargo storage planning, i.e. the strategic
planning of the ship’s cargo, as well as speed and trim
management. The FSC, which is engaged in close dialogue with the DCIU regarding potential partnerships, has
enabled us to make our processes more efficient and to
reduce our costs. — NfR
With the aid of tools such as Navigator Insight (NI) and
business intelligence tools such as QlikView and Tableau,
the FSC manages Group-wide reporting measures relating
to ship operations. It consecutively works on improving
data quality in the systems and in 2018, implemented
and continually improved data availability in the different
areas. — NfR
The NI software makes it possible to create detailed
consumption profiles for our ships. At least once every 24
hours, the system uniformly records fuel-related data such
as quality, bunker supplies, daily consumption and time
of fuel conversion on journeys in protected areas, as well
as event-related information such as arrival, departure,
waiting times at sea and bunker processes. The data is
automatically validated during input. The use of this tool
means that we can also guarantee standardised reporting
for charter ships. — NfR

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

The Fleet Decision Support System
The Fleet Decision Support System (Fleet DSS) aids
the FSC by collating weather, geographic, route and
­operational data from a range of tools, including from the
NI ­system, and makes it possible to visualise select data
if required. This enables us to monitor our fleet in port and
at sea with relatively little input. — NfR
During this reporting period, technological changes were
made to improve ad hoc data retrieval in the Fleet DSS.
Recently, we have been working with a data lake, which
can significantly increase the speed of data retrieval
thanks to its flat data architecture. — NfR
Tracking process for the identification and realisation
of potential
Generally speaking, all project-related targets are given
measurable figures and monitored on a monthly basis. In
collaboration with the company Vessel Performance Solutions (VPS) and a Danish university, we further improved the
quality and availability of data in early 2018. Furthermore,
normalisation of the operational data on schedules, cargo
and routes enables us to determine major trends more
quickly so that we can make corrections in good time –
within one month instead of in three to four months. As part
of the project, Hapag-Lloyd provided important data that
facilitated model validation, thereby participating in expert
discussions. — NfR
One focus of the collaboration with our partners during
this reporting period was the early detection of fouling on
our ships. By using a new method, we are able to quickly
detect changes in water resistance occurring as a result of
fouling so we can initiate measures to reduce water resistance (e.g. removal of the source of the fouling). — NfR

R O U T E O P T I M I S AT I O N | D I G I TA L I S AT I O N A N D D I G I TA L S E C U R I T Y

Through ongoing tracking, we were also able to identify
major potential in ship utilisation levels and the further
optimisation of carrying capacity. Our measures also
proved highly efficient in improving the security of cargo
on deck, as well as on increasing the working load of the
hatch covers through structural changes. — NfR

53

Positive results
In 2018, the measures described above enabled us to
achieve savings in bunker purchases and increase the
capacity utilisation of our ships. The FSC also plays a
major role in ensuring that routes are provided as scheduled. This had a correspondingly positive effect on adherence to timetables and customer satisfaction. — NfR
We share information about the data recorded in the Fleet
DSS with relevant business partners on a transparent
basis. This enables us, for example, to use the empirical
data regarding structural changes both on chartered ships
and for our fleet, and to examine the extent to which our
business partners adhere to the contractually agreed
minimum performance of their ships. — NfR

DATA PROTECTION AND DIGITAL SECURITY

— 418/103

The implementation of digital solutions results in an increased responsibility to protect personal and corporate data to the best of our ability. New laws and digital
threats have a significant influence on our actions and our decisions in this regard.
We pay particularly close attention to the protection of our IT systems. — NfR

While the EU General Data Protection Regulation
­(EUGDPR) that entered into force in 2018 plays a major
role in our EU business activities and the operation of
our central IT infrastructure, we are also seeing a major
increase in data protection legislation in Asia, Africa and
Latin America. Many countries are basing their laws on
European legislation. Particularly in Asia, however, there
is also a trend towards increased restriction of the international flow of personal and important corporate data.
We monitor our processes with regard to more stringent
national requirements and adapt them where necessary. In
this way, we can always ensure our compliance. We also
take these and other security-related issues into account
when developing a new cloud strategy. One such pilot
project was set up during the reporting period. — NfR
As with other companies in our industry, new IT threats
continually influence our work because we have to protect
both ourselves and our customers from their effects. For
this reason, we continually monitor our technical infrastructure and train our employees in the relevant issues. — NfR
We consistently apply very high technical and process-­
related standards in order to guarantee IT security and
data protection. In doing so, we strive to set ourselves
apart from the competition while we meet our c
­ ustomers’
specific requirements, such as those placed on us by
the central compliance and legal departments of major
­customers as a result of the introduction of the EU
­General Data Protection Regulation. Sensitive data, such
as employee data and freight information, are also subject to separate technical and legal requirements. We
take these into account as a matter of course in all the
measures we adopt. — NfR

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

IT security on board our ships is particularly critical for us.
We therefore continually monitor all relevant developments
in the field. In recent years, for example, guidelines on the
topics of maritime cyber risk management and cybersecurity onboard ships have been developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the Baltic and
International Maritime Council (BIMCO). — NfR
Organisational integration of IT security and data
protection
Responsibility for data protection and data security within
our Company does not lie with one individual organisational unit but rather with the respective business units
worldwide. The Corporate Data Protection Office, which
is located at our headquarters in Hamburg, advises the
central departments, regions and areas on how to comply
with standards under data protection law. To this end, we
have established a data protection officer or coordinator
for each region and area. The data protection officer/
coordinator ensures that the Group’s requirements and
the local regulatory requirements are being implemented,
and coordinates with the Corporate Data Protection Office
on relevant measures and changes where necessary. The
data protection officer/coordinator is also available on-site
as a contact partner for staff and external parties. — NfR
Our central IT systems are monitored, managed and
improved by an IT Security team. The team is also
responsible for the security of these systems. Ongoing
dialogue with external security experts guarantees that
the team is always informed of the latest risks. Security
incidents, such as cyberattacks and emails containing
malware, are logged and processed by the team via a
ticket system. — NfR

D ATA P R O T E C T I O N A N D D I G I TA L S E C U R I T Y | D I G I TA L I S AT I O N A N D D I G I TA L S E C U R I T Y

Security of the fleet’s operational systems
We check the security of the operational systems of our
fleet separately because there is currently no link between
the key systems for ship operations and our land-based
IT systems. There is also currently no risk of cyberattacks.
However, new acquisitions that have technical external
access capability are associated with these kinds of risk,
meaning we will have to take preventive security measures in the future. — NfR
We are aware of this new requirement and are actively
preparing for it. In the reporting period, for example, we
further boosted our staff numbers so that we can deal
more comprehensively with the topic of maritime IT secur­
ity. Furthermore, we launched two projects dealing with
challenges such as the requirements of the International
Safety Management (ISM) Code (see Safe ship operations,
p. 40 f.), which will come into force in 2021. — NfR

In addition, a cybersecurity text will be integrated into the
classification programme of the International Association
of Classification Societies, which establishes minimum
technical standards in the shipping industry. The initiative
aims to implement mandatory security standards in 2021
which, among other things, address the increased risk
caused by operational technology applications on ships,
such as remote access to the main engine. This will soon
make cybersecurity another shipping-related security
topic, along with the classic aspects of security and seaworthiness of a ship. — NfR

55

With the IT Security Act that came into force in 2015,
the Federal Republic of Germany has implemented the
requirements of the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP). As a result of its transport
volume, Hapag-Lloyd AG is also subject to the requirements of EPCIP per its June 2017 version. In addition, the
implementation deadline for the European Commission’s
Network and Information Security (NIS) directive passed in
the reporting period, meaning that Hapag-Lloyd AG is also
subject to stricter requirements in the area of regulating
critical infrastructures. There are fewer changes required in
the operational specifications of Hapag-Lloyd AG’s IT systems than there are in terms of reporting and collaboration
with public entities in the field of IT security. — NfR
Informing and training employees
We set great store by ensuring that our staff are well
informed about the security topics described above. For
this reason, we train our employees in the responsible
use of information and data using blended learning. This
approach combines several learning methods in one
approach. If the law changes or new staff join our ranks,
we generally train land-based employees via both Webbased training sessions and on-site seminars led by
our data protection experts. Areas that handle sensitive
data receive training from us on specific issues as part of
risk-oriented corporate management. For example, we
prepared Sales and Customer Service employees for the
requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation via specific Web-based training sessions. — NfR
As planned, we launched a new training concept following the blended learning approach during the reporting
period. This combines various training methods, including
remote and on-site seminars, as well as course content
and news on the intranet. Experiences with the new
concept are very positive despite our high standards
for conveying insight that goes far beyond the minimum
standards of data protection law. We have thus raised
our employees’ awareness of data protection to an even
further extent. — NfR
Our seafaring staff are also trained and informed about
security topics. However, for technical reasons, we are not
able to carry out Web-based training at sea. Therefore,
seafaring staff employed by the fleet management are
instructed by officers with access to the content of training
sessions. — NfR

Data protection enquiries
We communicate important information regarding data
protection in a transparent way, for example via the data
privacy statement on our website and in our mobile app.
Both our employees and members of the public contact
us with specific questions on the issue of data security.
Usually, they are looking for more information about how
their data is processed by our Company. We have developed new processes – including a ticketing system – for
data privacy questions so that we are prepared for an
increase in enquiries and can promptly provide detailed
information to those concerned. — NfR
We did not record any notifiable violations of data protection policies in 2018. — NfR — 418-1

Outlook
Cyberattacks such as the Petya crisis in summer 2017
showed us that the shipping industry is subject to the
same risks as other areas of the logistics sector. For us,
this means paying more attention to the integrity and
availability of our IT systems in future, and going beyond
the legal requirements regarding their maintenance and
security. We continually work towards identifying the
most suitable processes for both our central IT and
local systems. To do this, we must find applicable solutions for various local systems, for example, so as to
exclude or minimise risks. Only through sufficient data
protection and IT security measures can we achieve
sustainable success with digital business models and
processes. — NfR

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

— 302/103, 305/103, 306/103

Our line of business and our global presence mean that we have responsibility for
the environment. It is our aim to minimise the impact on the environment and climate
caused by our work at sea and on land. To realise this aim, we apply global environmental and quality management standards and confirm the results via audits. — NfR

In the context of our long-term sustainability policy, we
establish company processes to avoid or reduce negative
impacts on the environment. This means that we adhere
to a range of environmental standards and certifications
both at our sites and on our ships. The certifications
include the global environmental and quality management
standards ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 as well as certifications on energy efficiency (EEDI1 certification) and the
prevention of oil, sewage and air pollution (including IOPP,
ISPP and IAPP2 certifications). — NfR

than 90) internal and external audits were conducted
worldwide. We use the results of the audits to continuously improve our processes. — NfR
Environmental management for land-based operations
is organised centrally and dealt with by Sustainability
­Management. The implementation of this is overseen by
the quality and environmental management (QEM) delegates at the global sites. Fleet Management, and in
­particular the Environmental Management department,
are responsible for sea-based operations. — NfR

We regularly assess our compliance with the requirements
of the standards and certifications as well as with applic­
able environmental laws and regulations by means of
clearly defined processes and audits. With the Hapag-Lloyd
blueprint, we can ensure, for example, that our sites worldwide have identical organisational structures and integrated
IT systems. — NfR
External ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 audits are carried out
annually in all regions and at our headquarters. The certification for the integrated quality and environmental management system was renewed for the fifth time in 2018
following the recertification audit by DNV GL. In 2018, the
certification included the Middle East region for the first
time, which was added as part of the UASC (United Arab
Shipping Company) merger the previous year. The audits
for our quality and environmental management system
include issues such as occupational safety, employee
training, customer focus and evaluation of service pro­
viders. In 2018, more than 170 (Hapag-Lloyd AG: more

In 2018, the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO)
Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC)
declared its commitment to reduce absolute greenhouse
gas emissions by 50% by 2050 as compared with 2008.
Hapag-Lloyd supports this ambitious goal. — NfR
Independently of this Group-wide target, Hapag-Lloyd
intends to reduce its specific CO2 emissions per

TEU-kilometre3 by 20% by 2020 as compared with the
base year of 2016. We quantify the success of our measures by the degree to which both Group-wide and local
environmental and quality objectives are achieved. We audit
this annually and make updates where necessary. — NfR

Another contribution is our reduction of the energy
­consumption of the various pump systems on board.
This is achieved through the installation of a frequencyreducing regulator. — NfR

The audit and update of these measures applies to all
our goals for contributing to environmental protection.
For example, Fleet Management aims to reduce bunker
consumption by minimising resistance in the water. To this
end, three of our ships’ hulls underwent cleaning during
the reporting period. Furthermore, ship-specific Biofouling
Management plans were developed in order to reduce
fouling on the ships’ hull. — NfR

CLIMATE PROTECTION
AND REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS

— 102-11

Reducing the greenhouse gases produced by our ships is a key goal of our climate protection strategy. The focus of our efforts is on increasing energy efficiency, strict requirements for newbuilds and measures for the reduction of bunker consumption. — NfR

EFFICIENT SHIPS

— 302/103

The increasing regulatory requirements with which
­Hapag-Lloyd is confronted are challenging from both a
technological and financial perspective. Hapag-Lloyd
always aims to achieve the lowest possible use of en­
ergy required in order to comply with the regulations and
provide the best possible transport service. This means
that our focus is on seeing the changing regulations as an
opportunity to reduce our own impact on the environment
and thus contribute to the protection of humankind and
the natural world. At the same time, Hapag-Lloyd is committed to ensuring that the regulations are equally binding
for all companies. — NfR
Whether we’re building new ships or modernising our
fleet, we rely on the latest technologies and designs.
Based on their exceptional maintenance, our ships can
stay in service for a lengthy 25 years. We have seen
that investing in the efficiency of our ships has a positive
impact in the long term on the environment and our competitiveness. — NfR — 302/103
Specifications for newbuilds — 302-5
For every new ship that we build, we develop a design
based on the latest technical efficiency and environmental standards. We use the Energy Efficiency Design
Index (EEDI) to determine the success of these efforts.
This index establishes a relationship between the engine
output, specific fuel consumption and CO2 factor, and the
capacity and speed of the ship. No new ships went into
service in 2018. In the previous year, due to the installation
of the latest technologies, the EEDI rating of the five new

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

ships was around 40% to 60% below the IMO reference
line for similar ships. — NfR
We continually upgrade the ships in our fleet. As we would
have to take the ships out of regular service for ­several
weeks for a reassessment according to EEDI, we will
forego a reassessment, even though it would likely lead to
much better EEDI values.
Modernising the fleet to increase efficiency — 302-5
In order to increase the energy efficiency of our existing
fleet and comply with regional laws, we are gradually
retrofitting ships on certain routes with “cold ironing” shipto-shore connections. This ensures that power is supplied
from the on-shore electricity grid while the ship is docked
at the port. As a result, the auxiliary engine is no longer
used to produce electricity, therefore almost no emissions
are released while the ship is docked. In 2018, we were
able to complete installation work on board the "Ningbo
Express", as well as successfully complete the initial
commissioning of the "Colombo Express". We are also
pushing ahead with the installations on board our "Hamburg Express" class ships. We are thus in compliance with
the provisions of Californian legislation. In many ports,
modernisation work is still required to create the technical
conditions for an electricity supply. — NfR
We continually monitor changing requirements in ports
that are relevant to us, noting for example that California’s
regulatory requirements had become more specific and
more stringent. Starting in 2020, 80% of the power supply
used in Californian ports must be covered by the on-shore
grid. By the following year, this quota is likely to rise to

our sea­faring staff on the ships under Fleet Management
regarding updates on fleet monitoring, speed regulation,
trim optimisation and reporting, in order to further improve
the energy efficiency of our ships. — NfR
We are increasingly using LED lights on board our ships.
At the same time, we are gradually retrofitting our seawater pumps to frequency control, which helps optimise
load-dependent pumping. These measures also help cut
CO2 emissions by lowering electricity consumption on
board. — NfR

100%. Requirements in some of the Chinese ports are
also increasing, even though they are not binding already.
In addition to retrofitting its ships to accommodate the
on-shore power grid, Hapag-Lloyd also tested other
options for an environmentally friendly power supply
for docked ships during the reporting period. Ships in
the Port of Hamburg were supplied with electricity via
­PowerPacs for the first time. These are containers that
hold gas-powered generators and a tank of liquefied
natural gas (LNG). The containers take over production of
on-board electricity from the ship’s auxiliary engine, which
results in a significant decrease in emissions. The next
step is to conduct an operational and commercial evalu­
ation of the tests together with our project partners.
We achieve further significant reductions in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions via hydrodynamic
optimisation of the bulbous bow in line with the reduced
speed profile of the ship. At the same time, the propellers
are also optimised in line with this required speed profile.
These optimisations lead to improved water resistance,
which results in energy-efficient performance and leads
to further reductions in emissions. During the reporting
period, we optimised three bulbous bows. — NfR — 302-5

Our bunker consumption in 2018 totalled 4.4 million
tonnes, which was an increase of around 12% over the
previous year (previous year: 3.9 million metric tonnes).
This increase was due to the growth of our fleet as a result
of the merger with UASC. This means that the figures are
not always comparable. — NfR — 302-1, 302-3
Around 13% of total consumption (previous year: 13%)
consisted of low-sulphur bunker fuels (MFO low sulphur
and MDO). — NfR — 302-1, 302-3
Bunker consumption per slot (in terms of average annual
container TEU capacities on a weighted monthly average
of all ships operated for us in 2018) also decreased from
2.85 metric tonnes in 2017 to 2.75 metric tonnes. — NfR

Energy consumption in fleet operations
With our Safety Management Manual (SMM) and Ship
Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP), we have
set clear guidelines to keep our bunker consumption,
i.e. our fuel consumption, as low as possible. We
continuously monitor adherence to the guidelines and
immediately inform our seafaring staff in writing of any
changes. For example, in 2018, we sent a fleet circular to

CUTTING EMISSIONS

— 305/103, 305-1, 305-4

The main drivers of our emissions are bunker consumption and bunker quality. Since 2007, we have cut our
specific CO2 emissions by around 49%4 through numerous measures. We want to ensure that this positive trend
continues. Our expressed target is to reduce specific CO2
emissions per TEU-kilometre5 by 20% by 2020 (base year
2016). — NfR

13,741,356
tonnes of CO2

Lowering emissions through active membership
For over ten years, we have been a member of the Clean
Cargo Working Group (CCWG), a global business-to-business initiative. It includes large shipping companies, global
traders and producers that want to promote responsible
shipping through standardised reporting. The shipping
companies represented in the CCWG account for around
85%6 of the volume of the global container fleet. A report
published annually by CCWG shows that we have continued to reduce our specific emissions by around 5.5%
compared with 2016.7 — NfR — 102-12
As part of our Carbon and Sustainability Pact, which we
have signed up to with Kühne + Nagel, we have committed to reducing the CO2 emissions of our joint container
transport. — NfR

Compliance with the maximum permissible sulphur content can largely be achieved by implementing three key
measures:
1. The easiest to achieve in the short term for all ships is
the acquisition of compliant bunkers. This measure can
initially increase the cost to Hapag-Lloyd of buying bunkers with low sulphur by about USD 1 billion per year.
2. The second measure is to switch to LNG, which is not
possible for all ships. This is associated with high oneoff retrofitting costs of about USD 25 to 30 million per
ship. For 2020, we are planning to convert one ship to
LNG by way of a test run in order to evaluate this option
during normal operation.
3.As a third measure, systems for cleaning exhaust
gases, known as “scrubbers”, can be used on board
some of our ships. This less cost-intensive option, which
has an investment cost of between around USD 7 and
10 million per ship, is to be initially tested and evaluated
on ten ships as of 2019.

We also take part in voluntary environmental protection
programmes in various ports, such as the Environmental
Ship Index (ESI), for which all of our ships are registered.
As part of this initiative, port companies reward ships with
ESI scores significantly above those specified by the local
port authorities.
Our customers can obtain transparent information about
the various emissions in their transport chain using the
EcoCalculator available on our website free of charge. The
emissions are calculated based on data from the CCWG
and EcoTransIT World.
We received accolades for our environmental action again
in 2018. We again were awarded the GoGreen Carrier
Certificate from DHL Global Forwarding. The evaluation
cri­teria were amongst other things CO2 efficiency, transparency and innovation.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER
PROTECTION

— 304/103, 306/103, 307/103

We protect maritime ecosystems wherever possible and take this task very
­s eriously. Ballast water is of major significance on board our ships and a topic
that we handle with great sensitivity. — NfR

BALLAST WATER
The IMO’s Ballast Water Management Convention came
into force in September 2017 with the aim of preventing
the proliferation of invasive species through the ballast
water that stabilises ships in transit. It requires all container ships to implement a specific ballast water management plan. Our entire fleet already meets this requirement
in full. In addition, a ballast water treatment system to
purify ballast water must be installed on every ship within
a mandatory time period of up to seven years. — NfR
The regulations of the US Coast Guard for the protection
of American waters go beyond IMO requirements. Currently, only 16 systems for ballast water treatment fulfil
these high requirements worldwide, so that temporary
exemptions must sometimes be made. We have had our
existing systems approved temporarily as an alternative
management system by the US Coast Guard. However,
we are working to gradually retrofit our ships in order to
meet the requirements of the IMO and US Coast Guard in
good time. — NfR

We regularly examine the water protection management

that are listed under the International Convention for the
Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) as well
as on breaches of ballast water guidelines. During the
reporting period, no such substances were released

SHIP RECYCLING

— 301/103, 301-2

The protection of people and the environment is a high
priority for us that extends beyond the end of a ship’s
operations. Our Hapag-Lloyd Ship Recycling Policy, which
we updated in 2018 in line with current EU law regarding
the Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM), reflects our
commitment to reducing negative impacts on society and
the natural world, even through the recycling of our ships.
We therefore insist that every newly built ship is equipped
with an IHM.
Hapag-Lloyd is also a founding member of the Ship Re­­
cycling Transparency Initiative (SRTI), founded in March
2018 by shipping companies, banks, shipowners and
charities. SRTI aims to communicate to a wider public the
obligation of the industry to recycle its ships in an environmentally friendly way under safe working conditions.
Hapag-Lloyd’s involvement in the initiative includes sitting
on the steering committee in order to expand its scope. To
this end, the initiative established its own website late in
the year. — 102-12

In 2018, we recycled four ships. In doing so, we selected
a suitable shipyard that is certified in accordance with ISO
14001, guarantees safe working conditions and issues
an IHM for each ship. We also commission a recognised,
neutral organisation to define, monitor and document
the entire recycling process on our behalf. To ensure
that downstream disposal is environmentally sound, the
shipyard is also expected to fulfil the requirements of the
EU SRR (Ship Recycling Regulation) insofar as possible.
Furthermore, it must adhere to the guidelines of the Hong
Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships, even though they are
not yet mandatory. Hapag-Lloyd explicitly supported its
ratification by the German Bundestag in 2018.
Hapag-Lloyd’s commitment to responsible ship recycling
was rewarded with the DNV GL’s Excellence Green Star
Award following an independent assessment.

PLASTIC POLLUTION IN THE SEAS

While the topic of plastic waste in the world’s oceans has
only recently gained relevance in public discourse, the
shipping industry has set a good example concerning the
matter for decades. As early as 1973, the IMO passed a
resolution on the prevention of pollution by ships, known
by the acronym MARPOL. The environmental regulations
stipulate, among other things, how ships must handle oil,
hazardous liquids, waste water and waste. The regulations
have continued to be updated over time.

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

From the start, Hapag-Lloyd aimed to be a role model on
this issue. This is manifested in our credo “No garbage into
the sea”, which has been a living reality for decades. Thus,
waste on board is collected, separated and deposited in
respective ports for proper disposal in line with local envir­
onmental regulations. Not least as a result of the shipping
industry’s commitment, the biggest plastic polluters of
the seas are on the shore. For this reason, Hapag-Lloyd
promotes projects that protect the oceans and their inhabitants. (See our commitment to the environment in the
chapter entitled “Social” on page 79.)

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

— 102-9, 102-10, 301/103, 307/103, 308/103, 414/103

In order to be able to provide our clients with the services they expect, we not only
offer our own services but also source significant financial and material amounts of
products and services from numerous global suppliers. The professional management
of external added value is thus a major factor in Hapag-Lloyd’s success.

The portfolio of goods procured is extremely diverse, ran­
ging from office materials and replacement parts for ships
to containers, bunkers and even 19,870-TEU container
ships. The externally sourced portfolio of services includes
shipments, terminal handling and maintenance, but also
training and consultancy services. The high technological
standards and diversified market structures for our global
needs, as well as the wide range of products and services, drive the complexity of our procurement activities. In
addition, the latest worldwide legal requirements must be
complied with at all times and any changes integrated into
our processes early on.

In 2018, we procured goods and services worth around
EUR 10,525 million. The year-on-year increase in the
procurement volume can be explained by the integration
of UASC (United Arab Shipping Company) and the rise
in bunker prices among other things. — 102-10

Other factors that must be taken into account when
­making sourcing decisions include the effects on the
­capital structures of our Group, as well as agreements
with our partners in the THE Alliance. Thus, effective and
cost-conscious handling of a joint service requires, for
example, agreement on the terminal(s) to be contracted.
In turn, not only existing contracts but also the advantages
and disadvantages for all partners are considered; these
financial aspects influence the decision-making process.

Procurement organisation
For the goods and services procured, we consider availability, quality and best possible prices as a ­matter of
course. Our procurement organisation is also ­oriented
towards the prevailing requirements and market
­structures. We guarantee perfect management of our
procurement activities through our centralised Global
Procurement organisation. Global Procurement’s remit
is primarily to harmonise procurement processes and
to train procurement staff around the world in modern
­purchasing methods and systems. Global Procurement
also works together with the mandated procurement
organisations to guarantee the best possible penetration
of our externally sourced goods and services. They do
this via the identification and realisation of bundling potential in the material areas for which they are responsible,
and by creating transparency about the procurement
activities themselves.

Around
€ 10,525
million
in purchased goods and services

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

Our Company’s core business is services. For this ­reason,
we do not calculate the percentage of renewable or
­recyclable materials for externally procured materials.
If a ship from our fleet is decommissioned, nearly all
the component parts are recycled (see Ship recycling,
p. 66). — 301-1, 301-2

In addition to central procurement, some procurement
responsibility is also delegated to the regions and areas,
with Global Procurement ensuring functional management. Those individually responsible receive strategic and

M A N A G E M E N T A P P R O A C H | S U P P LY C H A I N

methodological support or active support with the implementation of measures.
This organisational structure enables us to satisfy our
requirements with the best possible quality of goods and
services, while simultaneously and effectively guaranteeing
organisational cost responsibility. As a result of the standardised global processes and systems that we combine
with our regional knowledge of the markets and their
requirements, we ensure that we can make optimal procurement decisions based on quality, availability and cost.
Global Procurement is currently working together with
local procurement units on a variety of projects. In addition
to the further improvement of the cost structure and the
associated boost for Hapag-Lloyd’s competitive edge, the
aim of these projects is primarily to strengthen our expert­
ise in procurement in order to be able to manage the
relationships with our suppliers even more sustainably.

Global “Agora” project to promote excellence
in procurement
The “Agora” project aims to identify and implement add­
itional potential, as well as to monitor the strategic1 and
operative2 procurement process for efficiency and compliance, among other things. During the implementation of
improvements, we have identified the following key success factors in particular:
– C
 lear delineation of roles between strategic and operative procurement
– Increased automation in the commissioning of suppliers
– Establishment of sustainable assessment and development processes for suppliers
In addition, the Methods, Processes and Controlling
(Global Procurement MPC) department, established in
2017, trains the Procurement team on the application
of advanced procurement and supplier management
1	Including determination of targets, requirements/market/supplier analyses,
definition and implementation of tendering and negotiation strategies, procurement performance assessment and contract management
2	Including realisation of savings potential within the scope of actual orders,
as well as the assurance of efficiency and compliance with these operational
activities

methods. In the process, experience acquired during
the project is systematically recorded. The department
works alongside the other relevant departments on the
implementation and ongoing improvement of procurement
processes and systems.
In 2018, the optimisation of procurement activities in various areas from the regions Europe and Asia was actively
supported by the other regions and by Global Procurement in phases which lasted several months. In 2019, we
will roll out these methods in other areas and continue to
improve them based on the experiences garnered so far.
More efficient processes in collaboration with our
business partners: terminal partnering
In addition to internal optimisations, we are also working together with our business partners on continually
improving processes. As part of the “Terminal Partnering”
project, the individual processes before and after arrival
at the port, as well as during handling, are analysed by
Hapag-Lloyd staff and the terminal operators. This aims to
shorten the time required for the port call and for the use
of terminal services (such as container storage). The information required for this, which is currently recorded locally,
will be provided in future by the Fleet Support Center.
The data helps the project team to work out advance
hypo­theses regarding processes needing improvement,
which are then tested on-site. In 2018, for example, time
and cost savings were identified in Jebel Ali (Dubai) and
Colombo (Sri Lanka) via the following measures:
– E
 arly communication of anticipated arrival time
– Improved communication with authorities and service
providers in order to shorten waiting times on arrival and
departure
– More efficient use of terminal trucks
– Optimised cargo storage planning in coordination with
the terminal
– Avoidance of work interruptions for the gantry cranes
Supplier management — 102-9, 308-2, 407-1, 414-2
It is important to us that we build trusting and long-lasting
ties with our partners and that we maintain existing relationships. Our structured selection processes, the evaluation and development of our suppliers, and the systematic
identification and evaluation of risks in the supply chain all
play a major role in achieving this.

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

Our sustainability policy and the quality and environmental
management (QEM) manual are other important bases for
our supplier management strategy. In our QEM manual, we
have established a consistent approach to supplier qualification and assessment, where we communicate to sup­
pliers the same understanding of the basic values inherent
to our partnership, regardless of whether the responsibility
for procurement is regional or global.
If we decide to engage in a supplier relationship, we
require the business partner to sign our supplier code of
conduct. Alternatively, our partners may establish their own
standards with the same minimum requirements to ensure
that they also share our corporate values.
Our sourcing decisions are based on specific criteria:
depending on the nature of the regional market and the
flexibility of services available on the route, we are sometimes only able to rely on a limited number of business
partners, e.g. terminal service providers. Here, the decision
on whether we serve a particular route is followed by a
sourcing decision on how to cater for this service.
We also take social and environmental topics into account
during the selection process. For example, we evaluate IT
products based on criteria including energy consumption,
emissions and other environmental factors (green IT), as
well as compliance with the relevant certificates (e.g. the
German ecolabel Blue Angel for printers). We also provide
services – where possible and reasonable – using local
service providers in order to save on journey times.
Throughout the partnership, our service providers regularly inform our Procurement team about how they tackle
environmental and social challenges within their field of
business, and how they distinguish themselves from the
competition in terms of these topics. Port and terminal
operators, for example, highlight how they lower the diesel
consumption of cranes, produce electricity in a resourcefriendly way or reduce truck waiting times. When selecting
suppliers, we factor these criteria into our sourcing decision as well.
We require a self-assessment from all suppliers with high
supply volumes. The suppliers must submit them every
two years or undergo audits – generally performed by
Hapag-Lloyd – on topics such as quality, compliance,

M A N A G E M E N T A P P R O A C H | S U P P LY C H A I N

employee requests, the use of subcontractors, IT security
and the environment. If a supplier fulfils our requirements,
we add them to our Approved Supplier List (ASL). If a supplier does not fulfil our requirements, we make a record of
deficiencies and remedial measures. If these measures are
not implemented satisfactorily, we terminate the contract.
Procurement guidelines — 102-10, 307-1, 419-1
We are also reviewing our procurement guidelines as part
of the further development of Global Procurement. By
launching our eProcurement systems, we aim to describe
our processes in more detail using the relevant workflows,
and to harmonise and standardise them. In this context,
we are currently ­revising our present procurement guidelines and introducing new reporting guidelines. We reflect
regional differences where necessary with regional appendices agreed upon with Global Procurement.
In 2018, there were no significant breaches of our ecological or social standards in our supplier relationships
managed by Global Procurement. If the regions or areas
identify potential breaches in their areas of responsibility, remedial measures are established here as well and
subsequently reviewed.

Future development of procurement — 102-10
We selected a global eProcurement tool in 2018 and
are currently in the process of implementing it. The tool
will help us to harmonise processes, increase efficiency
and further professionalise our procurement activities. In
addition to processing tenders and contracts electronic­
ally, it also offers us the opportunity to provide relevant
information about the business relationship with suppliers
in the Group, to carry out strategic assessments and to
manage both the process for the agreement on objectives
and the development of suppliers. Our aim is to increase
transparency and develop sustainable measures for
improvements, as well as identify focus topics for areas
of activity. The tool also presents supplier qualification
measures, so that all mandated procurement areas can
draw on this information. The tool is set to go live, and
global roll-out to commence, in 2019. The implementation
of the downstream module (purchase-to-pay process for
selected areas of the indirect material) is due for launch in
mid-2019.

ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PROCUREMENT
One of our Company’s core activities is the procurement of containers and fuel.
We use strict selection criteria to ensure that we comply with technical standards
and environmental regulations. We are also increasing the percentage of steelfloor ­c ontainers in our container fleet. These are more environmentally friendly and
long-lasting than conventional containers and ensure that the cargo is more secure.

BUNKER PROCUREMENT

— 301-1

One major criterion for bunker procurement is that they
have the highest possible energy content, which helps
to keep costs and emissions down. In terms of fuels,
we differentiate between distillates (MDO/MGO3) and
residual oils (IFO/HFO/ULSFO4); both fuel categories are
­distinguished by their heating values, which are calculated
using analysed ISO specifications. During the tendering process, we ask potential suppliers for the heating
­values of the distillates. An independent expert checks
the delivered quantities on-site and takes samples for
laboratory testing for factors including sulphur, ash, water
and density, which will be used to calculate the heating
values. — NfR
In 2018, we received laboratory analyses for around 96%
of our deliveries, for which we calculated the weighted
average sulphur content. During the year, we procured
a total of 285,093 metric tonnes of distillates with a
weighted average of 42.64 MJ/kg and 4,011,859 metric
tonnes of residual oils with a weighted average of 40.36
MJ/kg. This means that energy needs from bunker purchases were around 174 million GJ. — NfR

CONTAINER PROCUREMENT
Container floors
As a result of the load due to the transportation of heavy
goods, the floor is the part of a container that is most
often damaged and must be replaced. We are currently
using hybrid floors, for example. These are made of bamboo and wood.
In light of this, we have examined whether floors made
of recyclable used plastic could be an alternative. We
decided in favour of our own internally developed containers with steel floors, as they are environmentally friendly,
clean, stable and secure.

E N V I R O N M E N T A L LY F R I E N D LY P R O C U R E M E N T | S U P P LY C H A I N

In our opinion, steel-bottom containers also represent the
best long-term technology. Even though bamboo floors
are made from a fast-growing raw material, they are seen
as a bridging technology because they are less durable
due to their lower tensile strength, among others.

73

In partnership with the Institute of International Container
Lessors (IICL) and the Container Owners Association
(COA), we are working to develop innovative container
standards.

REEFER CONTAINERS

40,100 TEU
steel floor containers since 2015

Since 2015, we have procured around 40,100 TEU with
steel floors – corresponding to around 2% of our fleet.
This means that we were able to further pursue our aim
to increase the number of steel floor containers in our
fleet in the reporting year. For standard containers, we
currently estimate a useful life of 13 years, which means
that switching to steel containers is a long-term goal. The
number of manufacturers supplying steel floor containers
increased by two in 2018, though this is still insufficient to
meet demand. Further investments will be necessary on
the part of the manufacturers in order to ensure sufficient
supply. With our increasing demand, we aim to motivate
manufacturers to expand their capacity. We are engaging
in open discussions with competitors and container leasing companies, and talking to our customers about more
widespread use of steel floors.
In order to increase the acceptance of steel floor containers, we work on raising our customers’ awareness of
the advantages. We primarily do this in customer discussions, via information material, or with offers of assistance
regarding cargo security. This last aspect is of particular
importance because modern security options combined
with steel floor containers can significantly increase the
security of the cargo. Furthermore, steel floor containers
have a longer useful life, are more stable and offer more
storage space.

One major aspect of goods transportation is reefer containers. They are equipped with a unit that can keep the
container at a steady temperature of between –30°C and
+30°C. Hapag-Lloyd has a reefer fleet comprising a total
of around 185,500 TEU. Two sustainability-related issues
here are energy efficiency and environmentally friendly
cooling agents.

Energy efficiency — 302-3
The reefer units are classified as “efficient” or “inefficient”
and are available in varying degrees of effectiveness. We
have only been using units with high energy efficiency
ratings for many years now. In order to ensure that classification is independent and robust, we also conduct our
own efficiency tests on most of the models under specified load conditions. This also includes various external
and simulated operating temperatures. The results of
these tests help us to determine the ideal usage type for
each reefer. The average energy consumption per 40-foot
reefer container has decreased in the last 16 years, from
6.8 kWh/unit (2002) to 3.3 kWh/unit (2018). — NfR

Environmentally friendly cooling agents
International regulations on avoiding greenhouse gases
are very stringent. The requirements are set out in the
Montreal Protocol and the EU regulation on fluorinated
greenhouse gases, among others. We see these regulations as the impetus for us to take action in the selection
of cooling units and the types of coolant they use.
One particular challenge is that there is no single industry standard as yet, and that manufacturers continue
to develop different solutions. We are supporting these
measures by testing new technologies and alternative
cooling agents. For example, we are testing containers
that use CO2 as a cooling agent.

CUSTOMER FOCUS
Our positioning on the market as a high-quality provider is a major driver for our
­c ompany. We focus on providing reliable and high-quality services to the ­a pproximately
30,200 customers around the world for whom we carry out transports.

Our fundamental aim is to maintain a diversified customer
portfolio consisting of direct customers and freight forwarders. In order to plan as effectively as possible, we
place great value on long-term contractual relationships.
We have a well-balanced customer base comprising
large, medium-sized and smaller clients with short-term,
­medium-term and long-term contracts.
Finally, as a customer-focussed company, customer
satisfaction and loyalty are of particular importance to
us in maintaining this well-balanced customer portfolio.
The burden of proof specified by ISO 9001 certification
­attributes even greater significance to this matter.
We carried out wide-scale market research as part of
the new Hapag-Lloyd Strategy 2023. The results show
that on-time delivery and contact partners who are both
­avail­able and able to respond quickly in all phases of
transport are major factors in customer satisfaction. To
guarantee them, various departments work hand in hand
in different areas across the regions, based on the blueprint organisational approach. The Sales department is
responsible for customer communication before the commission, for example. The customers are hereby informed
about relevant sustainability topics during tendering
processes. The booking process and customer care are
dealt with by Customer Service. Coordinating the practical
implementation of an order, i.e. the actual transport itself,
is handled by Operations.
The departments continue to work on improving customer
satisfaction, for example by developing basic functions
such as customer service, booking enquiries and the
provision of information and documents.

In August 2018, Hapag-Lloyd launched Quick Quotes, an
expansion of the comprehensive Web-based self-service
platform known as the “Web Channel”. This has ­enabled
Hapag-Lloyd to make a major contribution towards
improving handling of customer enquiries. Quick Quotes,
which is integrated into the Web Channel, enables our
customers to receive immediate online information about
freight rates, for example. In the past, this took much
longer. Furthermore, the customer can immediately submit
orders and download documents via the Web Channel.
This ­enables us to better respond to customer requirements and improve our level of service.
Our mobile app has also had several new functions
added. In addition to the existing capabilities, such as
tracking, timetable information and contact options, the
app can now be used to enquire about freight rates and
to make bookings. Other digital products for our customers are in the planning and development stages and are
undergoing continual improvement.

Customer surveys
In the reporting year, Hapag-Lloyd carried out its first
glo­bally standardised, and thus comparable, customer
survey, in which several thousand customers took part.
Analysis of the results enables us to identify potential areas
for improvement on topics such as responding to booking
enquiries or providing information and documents. We also
used the results to analyse how we could further improve
the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, as part of
a follow-up project in conjunction with respondents to
the survey. As a result of our positive experiences, we
intend to standardize the customer survey in the future and
conduct it several times a year.

Programme for setting ourselves apart from the
competition
Also in 2018, we developed a programme to help us
stand out from the competition. There will be various initiatives connected to this in the future. The programme aims
to deal with existing problems and challenges to customer
satisfaction and to develop new solutions that will enable
us to differentiate ourselves from competitors. A Voice of
the Customer process will play a key role in developing
and implementing the initiatives.

SOCIAL | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
As a traditional Hanseatic company, our values play a major part in how we see ourselves. They are anchored in our corporate culture and guide our perception of our
social responsibility. We are involved in causes beyond our Company’s boundaries
– both financially and through our employees’ active efforts. Our focus here is on the
areas of shipping and all the activities associated with it.

DONATIONS AND SPONSORSHIP
Via our donation and sponsorship activities, we support
maritime organisations such as seafarers’ missions,
the German Maritime Search and Rescue Association
(DGzRS) and museums and memorials with a maritime
dimension.
Our donation activity is guided by our economic success
and is transparently regulated by a policy that applies
to the entire Company. This policy also stipulates that
no donations may go to political parties. Corporate
Communications is informed of all financial expenses in
advance of each donation and establishes the annual
budget in consultation with the Executive Board at the
start of the year.
In the 2018 reporting year, we spent a total of EUR
421,100 on our CSR activities worldwide.

Marking the 100th anniversary of the death
of Albert Ballin
To mark the 100th anniversary of the death of Albert Ballin, Hapag-Lloyd launched three new sponsorship prizes
in 2018. They will each be awarded every four years. The
two Albert Ballin Awards for Globalization Research, each
worth EUR 5,000, are awarded to young scientists whose
exemplary research broadens and deepens our understanding of the risks and opportunities of globalisation. By
awarding these two awards, we want to promote innovative and critical projects that use the social sciences,
humanities and cultural sciences to address the problems
and processes involved in globalisation and thus lay the
foundation for future responsible action. The third Albert
Ballin Award, worth EUR 50,000, is awarded to organisations that champion networking and communication
between people and cultures and that help the victims of
globalisation.
In 2018, the awards were presented at a reception hosted
by the senate at Hamburg Town Hall. The Doctors Without
Borders organisation received the award for its work in
conflict zones where local health care structures can no
longer meet the needs of the population.
The two Albert Ballin Awards for Globalization Research
went to Johanna Beamish and Felix Hadwiger. Taking a
historical perspective of globalisation, Johanna Beamish
analysed the transit experiences of 19th-century sea passengers – chronicling their hopes and fears, with an eye
on internationalism and interculturalism. Felix Hadwiger
took a legal perspective to look at how non-state actors
can create policies for “legal vacuums” in a globalised
world. This involves using the risks and opportunities of
non-state standards (“soft law”) as the framework for
global economic action.

ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION
Hapag-Lloyd also supported Thalia Theater’s Hamburg
production of “Die dritte Republik” (“The Third Republic”)
with a donation of EUR 20,000. This play by Austrian
playwright Thomas Köck compares modern Europe with
Europe at the end of World War I. One of the characters is
Albert Ballin, who relates the idea of the nation state to the
need for increasing globalisation.

EDUCATIONAL ACTION
Since 2018, Hapag-Lloyd has been contributing EUR
200,000 per year to Kühne Logistics University’s new
Hapag-Lloyd research institute, the “Center for Shipping
and Global Logistics” (CSGL), especially for scientific
equipment. Amongst other things, the CSGL researches
the topics of digitalisation, sustainability and value cre­ation
in the shipping and logistics industry. The partnership
also sets up joint events and facilitates dialogue regarding
research findings.

Since 2017, we have been affiliated with OceanCare, an
organisation that works to protect marine animals and
oceans, and WWF Hong Kong, which champions the
protection of nature and animal species. As a result of
our discussions with these organisations, we decided to
implement a worldwide ban on the transportation of several controversial goods, including shark fins and hunting
trophies, for ethical reasons. In doing so, we want to make
a long-term contribution to the protection of endangered
species and to maintaining biodiversity.
Through our membership of the World Shipping Council
(WSC), we continue to work towards establishing the
traffic separation scheme off Sri Lanka’s southern coast in
order to protect blue whales on their migration routes. In
December 2018, we supported an International Maritime
Organization (IMO) delegation in their tour of the ministries
responsible for this project in Sri Lanka.
We are also available as speakers for the German envir­
onmental organisations BUND and NABU, contributing
our specialist expertise to the benefit of the environment
and society.

Our company and staff are involved in a wide range of
social initiatives and projects around the world. In 2018,
Hapag-Lloyd supported the “Hope for Haiti” project for
the eighth time. The project saw urgently needed school
materials and furniture transported to Haiti during the
reporting period. In Chiang Mai, Thailand, we provided
an orphanage with books as part of the “Build-a-Library”

project. Moreover, our employees took an active part in
the “Feed My Starving Children” initiative.
Our staff in the Latin America region are also committed
to social topics. For example, in a number of areas there
were activities marking International Women’s Day and
International Children’s Day.

ACTION AT HOME

INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS

In addition to our global activities, we want to make a contribution to our home city of Hamburg and are involved in
various local projects. Since 2015, we have been a member of UmweltPartnerschaft Hamburg, an environmental
initiative launched in 2003, and have championed efforts
to promote voluntary environmental protection among
companies in Hamburg.

Hapag-Lloyd is one of the world’s biggest container liner
shipping companies and Germany’s largest liner shipping
company. Ongoing dialogue with politicians at EU, state and
municipal levels is therefore absolutely essential for us.

In 2000, we launched Hamburger Ausbildungs-Netzwerk
(HANZ) in partnership with the Otto Group. HANZ prepares secondary school students for apprenticeships.
Thanks to the support provided by advisory services and
internships, a large number of secondary school students
have already obtained entry-level qualifications and been
accepted as apprentices at our Company.
Social responsibility is also a way of life for our young
professionals. Many of them were involved in our Talent
Development Programme and organised joint activities
with people with disabilities or with retirement home residents. They also organised a registration drive for potential
stem cell donors at our headquarters. The result: 185
employees registered. The health insurer pronova BKK
covered the costs of registration.
We have been working with the Gymnasium Johanneum
in Hamburg and other schools, including some inter­
national schools, for several years now. In 2018, we again
worked with these schools to put a number of projects
such as internships, career presentations and ship visits
into action. The employees who took part were relieved
from their own work activities for the duration.
We also contribute to the fields of culture and sport. We
expanded our commitment as a partner of Filmfest Hamburg and as the main sponsor of the premier league ice
hockey team, the Hamburg Crocodiles, with an additional
EUR 10,000 each. In addition to our annual sponsorship
of the horse race in Hamburg’s Horn district, we also
organised events for local clubs and initiatives, such as
the Rotary and Lions Clubs, in 2018. Furthermore, various
public events were held at our headquarters on Ballin­
damm in Hamburg. Among them were the “Lange Nacht
der ZEIT”, talks and concerts. The HLAG rock band also
took part in various events and collected money for charities (such as Welthungerhilfe, whose goal is to eradicate
world hunger).

At European Union (EU) level, we are actively involved in
the political decision-making process. To ensure that this
happens in a clear and comprehensible way, we are listed
in the Transparency Register of the European Commission. We want to participate in the formation of sustainable environmental legislation and to bring our stringent
Group-wide environmental standards into the industry. In
doing so, we want to ensure that our investments in more
efficient and environmentally friendly ships does not put
us at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we want
to prevent a situation whereby modernisations no longer
meet newer environmental requirements after just a short
period of time. We therefore took charge of a work package from the “Air Emissions from Ships” subgroup of the
European Sustainable Shipping Forum within the European Commission in 2017. On the topic of air pollution,
we also actively participated in the Searica1 panel in the
European Parliament.
At state and municipal level, we conduct frequent discussions with the City of Hamburg. The city is part owner of
Hapag-Lloyd and therefore a central stakeholder in our
Company. As part of our accountability obligations, we
regularly provide the city with information about the Company’s economic performance and our strategic objectives. We communicate our perspectives on infrastructural
matters to those involved in policymaking. This includes
the expansion of the port, the dredging of the Elbe and
the modernisation of rail infrastructure. One of the ways
we do this is by publishing a quarterly political newsletter
called “Hapag-Lloyd Inside”, which is sent out to about
3,000 people involved in politics, associations and chambers.
In 2018, we hosted discussion events involving the managers’ group of the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung foundation
and the CDU Economic Council at our headquarters on
Ballindamm. We also organise a parliamentary evening
once a year for delegates from the Hamburg Parliament
and members of the German Parliament from Hamburg.

During the course of the year, we also regularly seek
out dialogue with the various political parties. Our Chief
Ex­ecu­tive Officer, Rolf Habben Jansen, is also frequently
invited as a speaker to events in the field of politics or
those held by politically active associations.

authorities. Around 30 employees are volunteer mentors
to refugees as part of the project. To mark the three-year
anniversary of the project in September 2018, the Executive Board awarded many members of staff with a certificate for their commitment.

In addition to national political decision-makers, in 2018
we were also able to welcome prestigious foreign delegations, including those from Malaysia, Costa Rica, Ban­
gladesh, Finland and Indonesia. On 4 July, American Independence Day, we hosted a discussion event attended by
the US Consul General. We also hosted the President of
the Republic of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, with his governmental delegation in October.

Hapag-Lloyd is also involved with the Hamburg scholarships, which were awarded by Hamburg’s student services association for the first time in 2018. Hapag-Lloyd
finances three of the 18 scholarships, thus supporting
people from conflict zones who aim to complete a course
with a strong IT focus.

DISASTER AID
REFUGEE COMMITMENT
We have been involved in refugee assistance since 2015,
most notably with our “Hapag-Lloyd helps” project. The
project is the responsibility of our Corporate Communications department and is organised with the assistance
of three student employees. They actively bring together
staff, refugees, volunteers, the housing and assistance
organisation “Fördern und Wohnen” and the municipal

In the event of natural disasters, we quickly and efficiently
step in to provide free transportation services. In this way,
urgently needed aid supplies can reach their destinations
as quickly as possible. Our departments in the affected
regions coordinate the relevant disaster aid efforts. Aid
shipments of this kind must always be approved by the
Hapag-Lloyd Executive Board. In 2018, Hapag-Lloyd
once again transported food and medicines to aid organ­isations in Venezuela.

INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S REPORT
INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S REPORT
ON A LIMITED ASSURANCE ENGAGEMENT
ON NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING 1

To Hapag-Lloyd AG, Hamburg
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on
the combined separate non-financial report pursuant to
§§ 289b Abs. 3 and 315b Abs. 3 HGB ("Handelsgesetzbuch": "German Commercial Code") of Hapag-Lloyd AG,
Hamburg, (hereinafter the “Company”) for the period from
1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 which comprises
the sections marked with the acronym NfB in the Sustainability Report 2018 of the Company (hereinafter the “Non-­
financial Report”).
Responsibilities of the Executive Directors
The executive directors of the Company are responsible
for the preparation of the Non-financial Report in accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289b to
289e HGB.
This responsibility of Company’s executive directors
includes the selection and application of appropriate
methods of non-financial reporting as well as making
assumptions and estimates related to individual non-­
financial disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have considered
necessary to enable the preparation of a Non-financial
Report that is free from material misstatement whether
due to fraud or error.
Independence and Quality Control of the Audit Firm
We have complied with the German professional
­provisions regarding independence as well as other ethical
requirements.

1	PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH has performed a limited assurance
­engagement on the German version of the combined separate non-financial
report and issued an independent assurance report in German language,
which is authoritative. The following text is a translation of the independent
assurance report.

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 8

Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements
and professional standards – in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors and German
Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer
und vereidigte Buchprüfer“: “BS WP/vBP”) as well as the
Standard on Quality Control 1 published by the Institut der
Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany;
IDW): Requirements to quality control for audit firms
(IDW Qualitätssicherungsstandard 1: Anforderungen an
die Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis −
IDW QS 1) – and accordingly maintains a comprehensive
system of quality control including documented policies
and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and
regulatory requirements.
Practitioner´s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance
­conclusion on the Non-financial Report based on the
assurance engagement we have performed.
Within the scope of our engagement, we did not perform
an audit on external sources of information or expert
­opinions, referred to in the Non-financial Report.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance
with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements
other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires
that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to
allow us to conclude with limited assurance that nothing
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that
the Company’s Non-financial Report for the period from
1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 has not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with §§ 315b
and 315c in conjunction with 289b to 289e HGB.

I N D E P E N D E N T P R A C T I T I O N E R ’ S R E P O R T | I N F O R M AT I O N

In a limited assurance engagement the assurance
­procedures are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore a substantially lower
level of assurance is obtained. The assurance procedures
selected depend on the practitioner’s judgment.
Within the scope of our assurance engagement, we
performed amongst others the following assurance
­procedures and further activities:
–	Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the
­sustainability organization
–	Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation of the
Non-financial Report regarding the preparation process,
the internal control system relating to this process and
selected disclosures in the Non-financial Report
–	Conduct of a site visit with focus on occupational health
and safety
–	Identification of the likely risks of material misstatement
of the Non-financial Report
–	Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures in the
Non-financial Report
–	Comparison of selected disclosures with corresponding
data in the consolidated financial statement and group
management report
–	Evaluation of the presentation of the non-financial
­information

89

Intended Use of the Assurance Report
We issue this report on the basis of the engagement
agreed with the Company. The assurance engagement
has been performed for purposes of the Company and the
report is solely intended to inform the Company about the
results of the limited assurance engagement. The report
is not intended for any third parties to base any ­(financial)
decision thereon. Our responsibility lies only with the
Company. We do not assume any responsibility towards
third parties.

Assurance Conclusion
Based on the assurance procedures performed and
assurance evidence obtained, nothing has come to our
attention that causes us to believe that the Company’s
Non-financial Report for the period from 1 January to
31 December 2018 has not been prepared, in all material
aspects, in accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289b to 289e HGB.

FOREWORD OF THE EXECUTIVE
BOARD

— 102-14

Ladies and Gentlemen,

“Navigare necesse est” – the Roman general Pompey reputedly proclaimed these words over
2,000 years ago: “We have to sail”. This sentence is as valid today as it was back then.
Our complex, globalised world, based on the division of labour, is more reliant than ever on the
per­fectly synchronised exchange of goods. About 90% of global trade is conducted by ship.
Last year alone, around 140 million containers (TEU) were transported on board of more
than 5,000 container ships around the world.
­ apag-Lloyd has played a leading role in this industry for decades and significantly expanded
H
its market and competitive position in recent years. A key strategic milestone for our Com­­­pany
was the merger with and subsequent integration of UASC (United Arab Shipping Company)
last year. This step enabled us to substantially strengthen our presence on routes between Asia
and Northern Europe and between Asia and North America – as well as in the Middle East, of
course. We can now offer our global customers an even better product and even greater
coverage of the world’s most important trades.
With some 10 million containers (TEU) transported annually, a fleet of 219 ships and ap­proximately
12,500 employees, we are one of the five biggest container liner shipping companies in the
world today. This means that we have a significant responsibility, not just to our more than
32,000 international customers, but to all our other stakeholders. In light of this significant
responsibility, we believe it is our role and duty as a company to think and act sustainably. We
do this in relation to service quality, environmental protection, social involvement, continuous
dialogue with our stakeholders, and occupational health and safety for our staff on land and at
sea, among other things.
How we think and act as a company is guided by our clearly defined “Global Code of Ethics”.
This ensures that our employees act in a proper and responsible manner and that we engage
with our global partners in the spirit of fairness and based on ethical criteria.

FOREWORD OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

“In light of our significant
responsibility, we believe it is our role
and duty as a company to think and
act sustainably.”

Our incontrovertible principles include observing human rights, respecting the personal rights
and dignity of the individual, prohibiting discrimination of any kind, working with others on the
basis of fairness and cooperation, and maintaining a high level of professionalism. In addition,
we prioritise sincerity, loyalty, individual responsibility, integrity and respect towards fellow humans
and the environment.
Continuous investment and involvement in protecting the environment is a core element of
our sustainability activities. We aim to make a substantial contribution towards conserving n
­ atural
resources and utilising our operating resources in a responsible and environmentally friendly
manner. In the 2017 financial year, H
­ apag-Lloyd had one of the youngest container ship fleets in
the industry.
And in recent years, we have also greatly reduced our average bunker con­sump­tion by investing
in new ships, for example. With our long-standing and wide-­ranging ­expertise on the issue of
environmental protection, we are also involved in numerous regional and inter­regio­nal associations and organisations as well as in innovation projects. The fundamental c
­ hallenges within
our industry – namely, a volatile market environment, excess ­capacities and the low freight rates
that they result in – will remain with us in 2018. However, we believe that developments in the
medium term will be positive. Container shipping will continue to be an industry character­ised
by healthy growth and a well-balanced trade dy­namic. And ­Hapag-Lloyd will continue to be a
company with a strong focus on customers and on value creation for our shareholders, and will
maintain its clear commitment to sus­tainable thinking and action.
Hamburg, 26 March 2018
Kind regards,

Rolf Habben Jansen

ABOUT THIS REPORT

This first sustainability report (SR) contains the combined,
separate non-financial report (NfR) for the Hapag-Lloyd
Group and Hapag-Lloyd AG together. In line with the
requirements of the German CSR Guideline Implementation Act (CSR-RLUG), the NfR supplements the financial
reporting of Hapag-Lloyd with disclosures on significant
non-financial aspects in accordance with Sections 315b
and 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e of the German
Commercial Code (HGB). All disclosures which are part
of the NfR and therefore serve to ensure compliance with
CSR-RLUG have been marked with “NfR”. In the interest
of providing comprehensive reporting on the Group’s
sustainability activities, the disclosures made in the SR
exceed the statutory requirements of the NfR. — NfR
Unless otherwise indicated, the disclosures relate to the
entire group of consolidated companies. The group of
consolidated companies, which comprises Hapag-Lloyd
AG and consolidated affiliates, can be found in the consolidated financial statements in the annual report (see 2017
annual report, p. 146ff.). UASC Ltd. and its subsidiaries
are included in Hapag-Lloyd AG’s consolidated financial
statements from the date control was transferred on

24 May 2017. The figures presented in the NfR include
the effects of the transaction from this date and can
therefore only be compared to the prior-year’s figures to
a limited extent. References to disclosures outside the
Group management report constitute additional information and are not part of the NfR. The issue of supplier
management is regarded as a cross-sectional issue relating to the aspects which have been identified as subject
to mandatory reporting in accordance with CSR-RLUG.
However, the issue itself is not an aspect subject to mandatory reporting. Furthermore, the issue is addressed in its
own chapter of the sustainability report which is not part
of the NfR. — NfR
The NfR outlines the progress in the 2017 financial year,
i. e. from 1 January to 31 December 2017, and from now
on will be published annually in English and German on the
Hapag-Lloyd website by 30 April of the following year at
the latest. — NfR
The content of the NfR was subjected to a voluntary
operational audit in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised)
with limited assurance by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH

ABOUT THIS REPORT

Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft. The audit assignment
and result can be found in the opinion of the independent auditor on an operational audit to obtain limited
assurance of the non-financial reporting at the end of the
SR. The NfR is based on the internationally recognised
­Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards). We based our reporting
on GRI Standard 103 as regards the concepts for the
­NfR-related aspects. For these aspects, we also reported
non-financial indicators which are based on the GRI
Standard suitable for the topic, provided that a corresponding GRI Standard exists. Some of the content of the
report is marked for the NfR as well as for the GRI Standards. This content was not checked against the requirements of the GRI Standards. — NfR

company may differ from our forecasts, assessments and
announcements (see management report, p. 54ff.). — NfR

The information was requested by electronic means and
the data were predominantly recorded using area-specific
software. It is not yet possible to present a three-year trend
for many of the indicators, although the aim is to achieve
this in the future. When adding up data, rounding differences may occur. All forward-looking statements in the
NfR are based on the assumptions valid at copy deadline.
Due to unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors,
the actual results, developments or performance of the

and in the annual report. The next sustainability report is
scheduled for publication in April 2019.

To ensure ease of legibility, we do not use gender-specific
double pronouns in the NfR. This is not intended as
­indicative. All pronouns should be regarded as gender-­
neutral. — NfR
The statements on the group of consolidated companies
and on the reporting period as well as on the gathering of
information and on legibility also apply to the SR.
Our assessment is that the sustainability reporting complies with the requirements of the Core Option of the GRI
Standards.

Our fundamental aim is to maintain a diversified customer
portfolio consisting of direct customers and freight forwarders. In order to plan as effectively as possible, we
place great value on long-term contractual relationships.
Our 50 biggest customers account for significantly less
than 50% of our cargo volume, which demonstrates that
we have a well-balanced customer base. — NfR

Our services – 102-2, 102-6
In the 2017 financial year, our 387 sales offices (previous
year: 366) worldwide took care of transport contracts
for approximately 32,400 customers (previous year: approxi­­
mately 23,100). We position ourselves in the market as
a premium service provider that focuses on reliability and
high-quality services. — NfR

The goods transported by us can be divided into eleven
product categories. These include food and mechanical
engineering products, for example. The product c
­ ategories
are relatively well-balanced: The smallest category accounts
for 5% of the transport volume, while the biggest cat­
ego­ry accounts for 16%. This makes our business relatively
­un­­affect­ed by economic cycles within individual industries
and allows us to maintain a steady performance under
normal economic conditions. — NfR

GROUP RESTRUCTURING
AND MERGERS — 102-10
In May 2017, we completed our merger with UASC (United
Arab Shipping Company) and established the Region
Middle East as well as three new areas. We now have five
regions (previous year: 4) – Latin America, North America,
Europe, Asia and Middle East – and 35 areas (previous year:
32). As a result, we have grown internationally, strengthened our market position and become a company with a
younger, more efficient fleet. — 102-4, 102-6

The merger created a range of challenges for both companies’ employees. In particular, the move from the G6
Alliance and Ocean Three Alliance to THE Alliance as
well as the commercial cut-over after the transaction
closed involved particular efforts. With regard to the latter,
the change-over from the UASC bill of lading to the
­Hapag-Lloyd bill of lading as well as the integration of
UASC’s business into our booking system has been
completed. There have also been numerous office relocations, IT changeovers, the migration of freight rates and
a capital increase (see 2017 annual report, p. 56 ff.).
The merger went smoothly, which was mainly down to two
factors. Firstly, the open, professional communication from
managers from the outset, the high degree of acceptance
of other cultures among our employees (see Open corporate
culture, p. 29 f.) and the strong willingness to succeed among
all stakeholders played a significant role in helping the two
organisations to unite despite differences in their corporate
cultures and structures. And secondly, we provided specific
training on our processes and systems to around 2,000 new
employees at more than 400 events.

H A PA G - L L O Y D | O U R P R O F I L E

Aside from this training, our other employees actively supported their new colleagues in their day-to-day activities,
with the result that we were able to provide our customers
with the usual service during the integration.
Our organisation and number of employees had already
grown as a result of the merger with CSAV­(Compañía
Sud Americana de Vapores) in 2014. This merger
enabled us to establish the Region Latin America and
significantly increase our market share in South and
Central America.
As a result of the mergers, we have been able to expand
our presence on all the main East–West and North–South
trades by means of a very well-balanced range of services.
We firmly believe that our employees’ expertise and our
systematic organisational structure based on the scalable
blueprint were instrumental in making the amalgamation
of the three shipping companies possible within this short
period of time and with this level of success.
Merger with UASC is “Deal of the Year”
Our merger with UASC was awarded “Deal of the Year” in
2017 at the Lloyd’s List Global Awards in London. We were
chosen ahead of six other finalists for the accolade. The
jury highlighted in particular that the merger represen­ted a
good strategic decision in a challenging environment.
Strong partner in THE Alliance
We established THE Alliance with four Asian partners.
It commenced its activities on 1 April 2017 for a period
of at least five years. A total of 244 ships operate on all
the main East–West routes as part of the alliance. They
connect 76 important ports worldwide via an extensive
network of 32 routes. The alliance allows us to offer our
customers extensive port coverage, efficient ships and
fast transit times. In order to deploy the ships as effectively
and flexibly as possible in line with demand and ensure
structured communication with our partners, the representatives from the companies in the alliance communicate with each other regularly. – 102-7, 102-13

FINANCIAL INDICATORS
— 102-7, 201/103, 201-1

Wide-reaching efficiency gains and
cost improvements achieved
We continuously work on making our processes more
efficient and achieving cost savings. To enable this, we
have established a range of projects, which are already
having an impact.
The completion of the implementation of the CUATRO
(synergies from the integration of CSAV) and OCTAVE
(cost-cutting programme) projects in the first quarter of
2017 laid the foundations for generating annual synergies,
efficiency improvements and cost savings of approxi­
mate­ly USD 600 million as against the comparable cost
base in the 2014 financial year, and assuming that e
­ x­ter­nal
factors remain the same. The business performance
and development of earnings in 2017 was correspondingly positive and in line with expectations.
It is anticipated that the synergies from the merger with
UASC will contribute approximately USD 435 million per
annum from the 2019 financial year onwards. ­The Executive
Board of ­Hapag-Lloyd AG expects that the bulk of the
synergies can be achieved in the 2018 financial year. The
most important efficiency driver here is the merging of service networks. Further cost savings are expected to come
from the integration of sales and administrative functions.
As a result of the UASC merger, our fleet increased in
the year 2017 from 166 ships (31 December 2016) to
219. We now have one of the largest and most modern
container ship fleets in the world. The rise in the number of container ships increased our transport capacity
to 1.57 million TEU (previous year: 0.96 million TEU)
and our total container volume to around 2.35 million TEU.
Our transport volume also grew as a result of the merger
from 7,599 TTEU in the previous year to 9,803 TTEU in
2017. This is an increase of around 29%.
As a result, we were able to increase our revenue to
EUR 9,973 million (previous year: EUR 7,734 million).

In the 2017 financial year, we achieved a positive EBITDA
of EUR 1,054.5 million (prior year: EUR 607.4 million).
Our operating result (EBIT) of EUR 410.9 million in 2017
was also significantly higher than in the previous year
(EUR 126.4 million).

The freight rate was USD 1,051/TEU in the 2017 financial

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT
We base our day-to-day actions on the principle of sustainable development.
This means that our business activities today should not impinge upon or jeopardise
the prospects and opportunities of future generations. The Executive Board subscribes to this principle and derives from it the framework within which our Company
and our employees act in relation to the four dimensions of sustainability, i. e. the
environment, social involvement, the economy and quality. — NfR

SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES
The issue of sustainability is treated with great importance
within our Company. We believe that it is our duty to
protect the environment now and in the future, to provide
our customers with the highest quality, to secure satisfactory returns and to ensure the health and safety of our
em­­ployees. To fulfil these obligations, we have established
principles and objectives to guide our actions and incorporated them into our sustainability policy.
For us, complying with all laws as well as the rules of
conduct specified in our “Global Code of Ethics” forms the
basis for all sustainable action. Our management regularly
defines measures to ensure that our environmental and
quality objectives are met and to heighten awareness of
them. Furthermore, we continuously improve our high
environmental, quality and safety standards through active
and open dialogue with our stakeholders (Chapter 1).
We provide our employees worldwide with the option
of further training and other benefits (Chapter 2) and a
safe and healthy work environment (Chapter 3) because
healthy, well-trained and motivated employees form the
basis for our commercial success.
We employ digital solutions in a targeted way in order to
continually improve the quality of our services and protect
the environment (Chapter 4).
Protecting the environment from negative effects is a top
priority for us. We therefore use the most modern technology
to significantly cut our fleet’s CO2 emissions and contribute
to environmental protection (Chapter 5). We also endeavour
to prevent potential safety hazards to people, the environment, cargo and our property by taking proactive measures.

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 7

The high standards that we set ourselves also apply to our
suppliers and subcontractors, as we represent their services
with our good name as well. For this reason, we strive to
improve sustainability within our transport chain (Chapter 6).
In addition, we contribute to society in many different ways
above and beyond our direct business activities (Chapter 7).
In 2007, our Fleet Management was awarded the
­“Excellence – 5 Stars” certification from the DNV GL
making us the first container liner shipping company to
achieve this accolade. In addition to implementing occupational safety measures (MLC 2006 certification), this
standard requires certification according to ISO 9001
(quality), ISO 14001 (environment), the ISM (International
Safety Management) Code and the ISPS (International
Ship and Port Facility Security) Code on preventing maritime hazards, thereby combining standards such as these
for the first time. The “Excellence – 5 Stars” certification
also incorporates standards that go far beyond these
international norms and regulations. In 2017, the certifi­
cation was renewed for the third time. — NfR
We have already achieved very much over the past few
years in terms of sustainability management, and we
will continue to strategically develop this further in the
years ahead.

ORGANISATION OF
SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT

— 102-18

Our Sustainability Management team is responsible for
activities in this area. It coordinates and supports our
­sustainability activities, reports directly to the E
­ xecutive
Board as a sub-department of Corporate Development, looks after our Group-wide QEM (quality and

S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y M A N A G E M E N T | H A PA G - L L O Y D

environmental management) system, is responsible for
certifications in accordance with ISO 9001 and 14001
and is in charge of preparing the Group’s ­sustainability
report. In 2017, 86 (Hapag-Lloyd AG: 35) out of 96
(­Hapag-Lloyd AG: 45) departments1 were ­certi­fied in
accordance with ISO 9001 and 14001, which ­to­geth­er
form the Hapag-Lloyd QEM certificate. This means
that around 90% (Hapag-Lloyd AG: around 78%) of the
Company – i­n­cluding the ­complete man­age­­ment of container liner s­ ervice activi­ties – falls under the certificate.
A s­ tat­u­tory audit of the annual and con­soli­dated financial
statements takes place every year. Parts of our central
Finance department provide material needed for the audit
and are ­therefore not included in the QEM system. — NfR
The Sustainability Management department is supported
by 130 (Hapag-Lloyd AG: 67) contact partners worldwide,
known as QEM dele­gates, in the regions, areas and central departments as well as on the ships. These delegates
coordinate the QEM and other sustainability activities
locally. — NfR
We integrate new regions, areas, locations and ships into
­­
the
QEM system promptly. To ensure that the­se also meet our

in the reporting period.

high quality and sustainability standards, the responsible
employees will be trained accordingly. — NfR
Our QEM system is audited annually, with the focus
on issues such as occupational safety, customer focus,
employee training and evaluation of service providers.
Responsibility for other individual sustainability issues lies
with the specialist departments. — NfR

Around 90%
of the departments have a QEM certificate — NfR

At the Sustainability Committee’s meetings, the Sustaina­
bility Management team informs the heads of division
as well as the representatives from the regions about the
current sustainability activities. The committee assists with
efforts to identify sustainability opportunities and risks,
pro­motes the sharing of information across divisions and
is involved in coordinating sustainability-related measures.
The Head of Corporate Development chairs the meeting
and reports directly to the Executive Committee, which the
Executive Board is part of. — NfR

SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AND RISKS
Hapag-Lloyd continuously addresses, in a structured manner, developments in the
markets that are relevant for us and the markets that are relevant for society and
the environment. To begin with, we do this from an internal, risk-based perspective.
For this, we use our knowledge of the industry, our expertise and our many years
of experience. Then, we do it from an external perspective. For this, we also include
our stakeholders when specifying the issues that are important for us. — NfR

Together with internal and external stakeholders, we determined the materiality of selected sustainability topics for
the NfR and SR (see Material topics, p. 14). Using the net
method, we also examined whether there were any risks2
from the perspective of our internal risk management
system and internal control system and what the relevant
risks were (see Risk management, p. 12). If a relevant risk
is identified, the topic must be classified as material. The
results of our analysis show that there are no such risks at
present. — NfR

RISK MANAGEMENT

— 102-11

The long-term success of our Company is directly depen­
dent on how we manage risks that arise from our operating
activities and how we take advantage of potential opportunities. In this context, the interaction between business
strategy and risk strategy is particularly important. Thinking
and acting with a focus on sustainability is a fixed part
of our risk and business policy and is put into practice by
management. — NfR
In order to identify risks at an early stage and then assess,
manage and monitor them, we have established a Groupwide, multi-level risk management and internal control
system based on the COSO3 Enterprise Risk Management
framework. This system ensures that risks to the Company’s

2	Risks are deemed to be relevant if they are associated with Hapag-Lloyd’s
business activities, business relationships, products or services and are very
likely to have serious negative effects on aspects such as the environment
or social involvement, for example. Other issues that are relevant for the risk
analysis include employee matters, observance of human rights and efforts
to combat corruption and bribery.

existence are addressed in a responsible manner. The
system is also conceptually based on the Three Lines of
Defence model. It enables a systematic approach to risk
management. — NfR
The first line of defence is our internal control system (ICS),
which consists of the internal control checklist (ICCL)
and the corporate key controls. While the ICCL comprises
risk-reducing management and control measures along
the entire value chain for the regions and areas, the corporate key controls perform this task for the processes of
the central departments. The ICS is an instrument for
­man­aging risks in the operating processes. Responsibility
rests with the process owners here, enabling us either to
take preventive measures to counteract the risks arising
from our operating activities or to identify existing risks at
an early stage and adopt countermeasures. — NfR
The second line of defence consists of Compliance
­Management and Risk Management, operating independently of each other. While Compliance Management
aims to identify and prevent potential risks, Risk Management is also responsible for monitoring, controlling and
managing our relevant risks and therefore for providing
targeted support to our ICS. — NfR
We have established a risk manager in each of our regions
and specialist departments. They are experts in their
respective areas, and their awareness goes beyond
operating risks to include social and ecological aspects,
e. g. sustainable materials, ship recycling, and training
and ­edu­cation. Their task is to aggregate and assess the
risks identified by the risk management system and, if
­risk-­­reduc­ing measures have been implemented, to continuously monitor these. Our central Risk Management

S I G N I F I C A N T I S S U E S A N D R I S K S | H A PA G - L L O Y D

­ ompiles the significant risks and analyses the risk strucc
ture. On this basis, the Risk Committee monitors the
overall risk situation and reports quarterly to the Executive
Board, or on an ad-hoc basis if necessary. The Executive
Board is responsible for ensuring the effecti­veness of the
risk management system. The Audit Committee monitors
the effectiveness of the system at the highest level and
reports to the Supervisory Board. — NfR
The Corporate Audit department constitutes the third
line of defence as an independent and objective consultation and audit unit. It informs the Company’s boards

13

and committees of the operating risks and opportu­ni­ties,
irrespective of processes, and, in doing so, contributes
to the efficiency and effectiveness of the monitoring, control, risk management and managerial processes. — NfR
With its various lines of defence, our risk management
and internal control system provides a comprehensive
framework for an effective control and monitoring system.
It assists the company management in sustainably and
effectively managing the ever-more complex risks which
must increasingly also take account of ecological and
social aspects. — NfR

MATERIAL TOPICS

— 102-46

In September and October 2016, we performed a materiality analysis in preparation for the German CSR Guideline
Implementation Act (CSR-RLUG). This entailed identifying
26 topics in the areas of social involvement, the environment and the economy. A key element here was the
expertise of H
­ apag-Lloyd’s Sustainability Management
team, whose in-depth discussions with various stakeholder groups provided it with a comprehensive overview
of the topics that could potentially be material for the
Company. Another key element was the detailed com­
petition analysis which we performed in April 2016 to
identify relevant topics in preparation for the s­ ustain­abil­ity
report. As part of the materiality analysis, we surveyed
more than 200 people from relevant stakeholder groups
to obtain their opinions on the topics. The stake­holders
consisted of employees, suppliers, customers, scientists,
shareholders, Works Council members and rep­re­sen­ta­
tives from general society and the business community.
Among our employees, the QEM (quality and environmental management) delegates and the heads of the

specialist departments were surveyed. In order to identify
relevant suppliers, we asked the area heads of each of
our operating departments to name their three biggest
service providers per mode of transport, i. e. ­terminal,
truck, rail and feeder. Among the other s­ takeholder
groups, the key selection criteria were contact in day-today business and regular com­munication. — NfR — 102-42
Our Sustainability Management team then evaluated the
results and presented them in a matrix. — NfR
The topics identified as material form the content of this
sustainability report4 and are explained in detail. We will
conduct a stakeholder survey every three years to ensure
that we continue to report extensively on all relevant
topics. — NfR

T he topics marked “NfR” were identified in the materiality process as
being subject to mandatory reporting as part of the non-financial report
in accordance with CSR-RLUG. — NfR

In 2017, the Sustainability Management team then
­identified the topics under which our business activities
had an impact; all the material aspects as defined by
CSR-RLUG were taken into consideration here. We also
examined the importance of these aspects to our business
activities. The topics identified during this process form
part of the NfR. Although social matters as defined by
CSR-RLUG play an important role for Hapag-Lloyd, they
do not meet the materiality criteria of CSR-RLUG. As part
of the SR, we report on other important topics which
do not meet the materiality criteria of CSR-RLUG. For
example, we also describe our diverse range of activities
in the social arena (see Corporate social responsibility,

STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE
— 102-40, 102-42, 102-43, 102-44

As a globally operating company and employer, we have
a diverse range of relationships with different stakeholders.
Active communication with them helps us to understand
their expectations and perspectives, identify potential
im­provements and translate these into measures for action.
We seek to engage directly with our stakeholders on a
regular basis at various types of events such as trade fairs,
conferences and our own Annual General Meeting. In our
day-to-day business, we address an array of different
issues and matters. These range from general questions
regarding the Company’s performance to questions on
issues relating to risk, our employees and the environment
to enquiries about cargo and data security, and com­pliance.
Communication with our shareholders
The Executive Board and the Investor Relations team communicate regularly with shareholders, analysts and potential
investors to inform them about the Company’s direction and
business developments. They do so via investor events, discussions with investors, the Annual General Meeting and
detailed information on the IR section of the ­Hapag-Lloyd
website. We place great value on providing the capital
markets with an open, transparent insight into our strategy
and development prospects and on communicating relevant information in a prompt and comprehensive manner.
Communication with our employees
To foster open communication with our employees and
dismantle (perceived) hierarchies, we have developed
numerous – sometimes innovative – communication for­
mats. These include weekly lunches with management
representatives and meetings held every two months
where employees tell their colleagues about what they do,
with Executive Board members in attendance. In addition,
our quarterly employee magazine has information about
pertinent changes in the Company and interesting activities
that are taking place. Our internal communication channels
include the Executive Board’s regular discussions with
the Works Council and our intranet site, which we use to
keep our employees updated on developments (see Open
corporate culture, p. 29 f.)

Communication with customers
and business partners
We are in continuous communication with our customers,
business partners and suppliers. We are responding
to an increasing number of enquiries from our customers
about sustainability issues. We enter into cooperation
agreements with our business partners, e. g. with IKEA on
environmental issues and with the companies MAN, ABB
and Wärtsilä on technical enhancements relating to efficiency, reliability and environmental protection. We engage
in discussions with our suppliers about our code of conduct and other supply chain issues.
Political discussions
We maintain contact with various political players at the
municipal, national and international level. While we focus
on infrastructural and social issues in our home city of
Hamburg, we primarily address environmental issues at an
international level (see Involvement in political discussions,
p. 61 f.).
Communication with non-governmental
organisations (NGOs)
We also communicate regularly with national and interna­
tional NGOs. We work in partnership with the environmental
organisations OceanCare and WWF and conduct open
discussions with NABU. We foster a mutual understanding
of critical issues by engaging in face-to-face discussions,
participating in conferences and working together on com­
mittees, thereby playing an active role in finding solutions.
Key issues that we focus on here are ship recycling, pollution
emissions and the transportation of controversial goods
(see Environmental action, p. 60).

Communication with Hamburg and
the local community
­Hapag-Lloyd is a traditional Hamburg company. For this
reason, we regard continuous communication with the
city’s citizens a duty that we are glad to fulfil. Every year,
e. g., we open our doors to interested Hamburg citizens
as part of the Supply Chain Day (Tag der Logistik) and the
Heritage Day (Tag des offenen Denkmals) and invite them
to public cultural and informational events (see Action at
home, p. 61).
Our Company is a member of a large number of associa­
tions, task forces and other institutions which enable us
to become involved in a range of different issues. One
example is the Prevention Specialist Committee (Marine)
of the German Employers’ Liability Insurance A
­ ssociation
(BG)-Transport. The committee campaigns to have
the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorders among
crew members included in the catalogue of services of
­BG-Transport. We also took charge of a work package from
the European Sustainable Shipping Forum on the topic of
“Distance Travelled and Speed”. — 102-13
This report does not include information on all our memberships, but instead the individual chapters focus on
those memberships where we made a particular contri­
bution or where significant progress was made on key
issues in the reporting period.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE
Hapag-Lloyd regards corporate governance as the responsible, transparent man­
age­­ment and control of a company. This is of particular importance to Hapag-Lloyd.
Good corporate governance strengthens the trust of our customers, employees,
shareholders, business partners and the general public. It increases the Company’s
transparency, enhances its credibility and provides the foundation for managing the
Company on the basis of long-term value creation.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
A key aspect for ensuring responsible management of the
Company that is geared towards sustainable appreciation
is good corporate governance.
The Executive Board and Supervisory Board use the
applicable laws, in particular the German Stock Corporation
Act (AktG), and the German Corporate Governance Code
(GCGC) to manage and monitor the Company. The two
boards demonstrate their commitment to the GCGC by
issuing an annual declaration of conformity in accordance
with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act
(AktG) (see 2017 annual report, p. 23 ff.). In addition, the
Executive Board and Supervisory Board report on corporate
governance in the yearly Corporate Governance Report,
which is published along with the declaration on corporate
governance (see 2017 annual report, p. 22 ff.). — 102-12

COMPLIANCE

Our Company expressly commits to fair competition as well
as compliance with all applicable national and international
laws, in particular with regard to corruption, bribery and
price fixing. We strictly oppose any violations of these laws
and do not tolerate them in any way. We will legally pursue
any internal or external violations of applicable laws. This
position was underpinned by the Executive Board’s compliance statement in 2015. — NfR
Compliance organisation
The Chief Financial Officer has overall responsibility for the
central Compliance department. The compliance officers
in the regional centres and national affiliates ensure that
our compliance programme is implemented across the
Group. Our compliance organisation makes it possible to
fundamentally implement measures as part of the com­
pliance programme which ensure that the Company complies with laws and internal and external guidelines. The
Executive Board and the Supervisory Board’s Audit and
Financial Committee are regularly updated via compliance
reports. — NfR

“Global Code of Ethics”
We regard compliance – the adherence to laws, standards
and regulations – as the key to responsible and successful
corporate governance in the long term. It is of particular
importance within the Company, and outside parties are
also showing an increasing interest in it. — NfR
The biggest challenges we face in this area are new or
revised laws and external directives and the increased level
of regulation that we are expected to follow. The result of
this is that new processes and measures always have to be
put in place to implement the applicable laws and that compliance with these additional regulations must be continuously monitored. — NfR

Our corporate culture is manifested in our “Global Code of
Ethics”. It defines our basic values and the conduct that
we expect from executives and employees, both with
regard to internal and external relationships. The globally
applicable code is published in German, English, Chinese
and Spanish and summarises the principles for governing
fair dealings with each other as well as the customers
and business partners of ­Hapag-Lloyd. — NfR
The first basic value of the “Global Code of Ethics” is the
observance of human rights. In this regard, it draws directly
on the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human

C O R P O R AT E G O V E R N A N C E A N D C O M P L I A N C E | H A PA G - L L O Y D

labour law. The Corporate Audit department also focuses
on compliance with the code when it conducts its audits
and includes the provisions of the code in its audit catalogue. — NfR
We continuously examine the extent to which the “Global
Code of Ethics” and the Executive Board’s compliance
statement satisfy external requirements as regards compliance and update them if necessary. — NfR
We are also involved with the Wittenberg Center for Global
Ethics, e. g., to obtain ideas for putting ethical principles
into practice in everyday business. In 2017, this audit did
not identify any need for changes. — NfR
Supplier code of conduct
— 102-16, 308/103, 407/103, 414/103, 419/103

Rights. The code also reflects the content of the ILO’s core
labour standards, such as the prohibition of all forms of
discrimination, child or forced labour and sub-standard
working conditions. The right to freedom of association and
collective bargaining is also incorporated in the code. — NfR
The “Global Code of Ethics” is part of a web-based training module which all employees on land are required to
complete on a regular basis. Employees at sea who work
on vessels managed by our Fleet Management team
receive information in this regard via the so-called “fleet
circular”. The values of the “Global Code of Ethics” are
also reflected in numerous Group-wide and regional
policies and are therefore an important basis for the Compliance department’s activities. — NfR

It is important to us that our business partners also
practise our values and principles of conduct. For this
reason, we require our suppliers to sign our supplier code
of ­conduct covering aspects such as the environment,
em­­ployees, observance of human rights and efforts to
combat corruption and bribery. As a globally operating
Company, we are aware of the time and effort involved
in examining the various codes of conduct, some of
which are very detailed. We therefore offer our suppliers
two options. Either they can subscribe to the content
of ­Hapag-Lloyd’s supplier code of conduct or they can
confirm that they possess their own code of conduct
which is consistent with our values (see Supply chain,
p. 53 ff.) — NfR
Compliance training and reporting mechanisms

The Ethics Committee, which comprises the heads of
the Compliance, Corporate Audit and Human Resources
departments, is responsible for ensuring that the “Global
Code of Ethics” is adhered to. It meets on a regular
basis if it learns of new suspected violations so that it
can address these new reports and arrange action to
be taken. In the event of serious breaches, such as sus­
pec­ted violations involving child or forced labour, the
Ethics Committee is immediately convened. If any criminal violations occur, we always report them to the local
authorities. In addition, violations are prosecuted under

– 205-2, 205-3, 307-1, 406-1, 408-1, 409-1, 412-2, 419-1

To prevent breaches of compliance, the Executive Board
has implemented a range of measures as part of the compliance management system. These include mandatory
compliance training, which every employee on land worldwide must complete, as well as a whistle-blower system,
which allows violations to be reported anonymously.
Employees at sea who work on vessels managed by our
Fleet Management team receive information on the topic
of compliance via the so-called “fleet circular”. — NfR

Furthermore, in almost all the countries in which we operate, external lawyers are available to employees and business partners as representatives in the event of violations.
This ensures that the whistle-blower can maintain their
neutrality and anonymity. In addition, the discussions are
held in the local language, and the representatives have the
necessary expertise to proceed competently with a report,
thereby reducing the barriers to whistle-blowing. These
reports are consequently forwarded to the Com­pliance
department, in anonymised format if ne­cessary. — NfR

Around 93%
(Hapag-Lloyd AG:
around 89%)

of our employees on land participated in web-based trainings on the topics of compliance and corruption

No significant violations in the areas of corruption, dis­crimi­
nation or child and forced labour were reported via the
whistle-blower system in the reporting period. — NfR
Dealing with violations — 205-3, 206-1, 307-1, 406-1, 419-1
If there are any reports of compliance violations, we pursue
them immediately – e. g., by initiating an internal investigation by the Corporate Audit department. — NfR

The purpose of the comprehensive training concept is
to provide employees with the necessary knowledge and
to increase their awareness of the topic of compliance.
It is divided into on-site and online training modules. With
regard to the training modules, we differentiate between
compliance management training modules, regular onsite compliance training modules and topic-specific compliance training modules. A key component of the training
modules is the topic of corruption. In addition, there are
separate training modules on the topic of competition
law. — NfR

If employees are found to have committed violations, this
can lead to sanctions under employment law, such as an
official warning. If a gross violation occurs, the employee’s
contract may be terminated, the matter reported to the
relevant authorities or other legal steps taken. In the event
of a serious, confirmed violation by a business partner,
we reserve the right to terminate our relationship with the
business partner immediately. — NfR

If employees learn of or suspect compliance violations, they
are expressly required to report them to their manager, their
local compliance officer or the central Compli­ance department. They are assured that they will not be disadvantaged
by reporting violations of applicable law, regardless of
whether the violation proves to have occurred or not. The
same applies to business partners that report a potential
violation in good faith. — NfR

At the start of 2017, our Company was involved in legal
proceedings with the Peruvian competition authorities.
These proceedings were settled in May 2017 without the
imposition of any penalties. — NfR

EMPLOYEES | MANAGEMENT APPROACH

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

— 401/103

As a service company, well-trained and motivated employees are essential to us.
However, we also believe that it is our duty as a responsible employer to foster
the abilities and skills of the people within our Company and to offer them a safe,
healthy and progressive work environment. — NfR

As a global employer, our human resources (HR) man­
agement faces a range of challenges that can differ greatly
from region to region. A particular issue that we are currently addressing is demographic change in the German
labour market and the lack of highly skilled workers associated with this.
The recent integration of two competitors is providing our
HR management with additional challenges. The issues
range from the harmonisation of remuneration structures
to organisational integration to the task of amalgama­ting
different corporate cultures. Furthermore, challenges
re­gularly arise as a result of the work-related demands
placed on our employees at sea. Increasing ship sizes
and ever-widening ranges of duties are creating a growing
need for further training among employees.
In order to draw the attention of highly skilled workers to
our Company and maintain our employees’ enthusiasm
in the long term, we seek to present ourselves as an
employer which is forward-looking, modern and, at the
same time, aware of its history. Our efforts here centre on
specific measures aimed at strengthening our attractiveness as an employer and reducing employee fluctuation.

ORGANISATION OF HR MANAGEMENT

HR Management is in charge of all HR matters in Germany,
including needs assessments, job advertisements, interviews, contract preparation, and internal transfers and
departures. It also manages business and commercial
training for the land-based organisation. Marine HR is
in charge of HR matters pertaining to the sea-based
organisation, the implementation of training and further
education programmes and certifications (see Occupational health and safety, p. 35 f.). Both departments advise
company management and managers on HR issues and
work with the co-determination bodies. — NfR
Corporate HR looks after our expatriates and also is
responsible for international employee development programmes and the application of global policies and guidelines. These are also implemented in the marine division if
appropriate and legally possible. The department also takes
care of all employee development measures for the ­German
organisation, including advice, coaching, training and
chairing, as well as international development programmes,
such as the Talent Development Programme (TDP) and the
Management Career Programme (MCP). It also manages
the Global Staff Dialogue (GSD) (see Further education,
p. 28) and coordinates the worldwide remuneration structures for employees and management. — NfR

Our HR management activities are focused on ensuring
that there are globally uniform standards for the relevant
employee issues and on providing appropriate support to
our regional units in their own HR activities. — NfR

The HR departments of the individual regions are linked
to Corporate HR based on a dotted-line principle. They
are responsible for HR management at regional level, are
in direct communication with the HR departments at the
local sites and manage the implementation of employee
development measures at the local level. — NfR

The Human Resources (HR) department is responsible
for our employees on land. It is divided into a German HR
­Management department and an international Corporate
HR department. The Marine Human Resources (Marine HR)
department is responsible for our employees at sea. — NfR

The HR department agrees on the key issues and
objectives of HR management together with the Executive Board regularly. In addition, the HR department
is regularly audited by the Corporate Audit department
and the global Compliance department. The Marine HR

EMPLOYEES | EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION

EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION
One of HR management’s tasks is to search for qualified employees. Here, we
encounter very different challenges depending on the country and region, such
as local demographic developments, levels of education and training, mobility and
the availability of employees at each location.

EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT
A key approach to recruiting employees involves focusing
on young people as part of vocational training or a degree
programme. Our goal is not just to train them well, but
also to retain them at our Company in the long term.
The recruitment of young, new employees has changed
significantly. As more and more young people in Germany
opt for a degree programme, fewer and fewer take the
path of conventional vocational training. In the area of IT
in particular, we face major challenges when it comes to
recruiting young, new employees. For this reason, we take
part in a range of different career events and increasingly
use digital recruitment channels. We also specifically
provide information about the Company’s internal social
benefits which are offered to employees in addition to their
salary. These include a pleasant work atmosphere, attractive social benefits and an appropriate work-life balance (see
Employee retention, p. 24 ff.).

As part of our efforts to develop young, new employees,
we work closely with the Hamburg School of Business
Administration (HSBA) and the Nordakademie, where
we are represented on the Employers’ Advisory Council.
We offer four places on a combined vocational training and degree programme at the Nordakademie and
seven at the HSBA. With the latter, we are also involved
in the company work group, speed networking events
and information days, and we assist with accreditation/
re-accreditation for degree programmes and international
programmes, such as the HSBA Summer School.
The vast majority of our employees at sea stay with us in
the Company after completing their training, which means
that we rarely encounter problems staffing the ships registered under the German flag. However, the number of
recent gradua­tes is lower in the technical area than in the
nautical area. In order to recruit employees in the technical
area as well, we specifically target young talent at fairs, on
career portals and in face-to-face meetings.

EMPLOYEE RETENTION
Once we have recruited suitable employees, our goal is to
retain them at our Company in the long term.
Social benefits
An important instrument in this regard are the attractive
social benefits that are specific to different countries and
regions. Unlike in Germany, e. g., statutory health insurance
for general healthcare in some countries is insufficient
for our employees on land. We compensate for this with
additional voluntary health insurance, voluntary accident
insurance that exceeds statutory protection, and pension
and life assurance options.

EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION | EMPLOYEES

In terms of providing our employees with meals, we
operate either our own staff canteens or pantries, where
employees can prepare and consume their own meals or
grant assistance by other means. In Germany, we also
provide capital-forming benefits, an extra month’s salary,
paid leave in certain situations, such as after the birth of
a child or the death of a parent, and assistance in emergency si­tuations through the Präsident-Achelis-­ElisabethWiegand-Stiftung foundation.

statutory requirements and which enable our employees
to reconcile the demands of their work and personal life.
For example, there is a parent-child office at our headquarters to provide better support to families. Outside of
Germany, we also offer flexitime and other working time
arrangements if this is legally possible and compatible with
work processes.

EMPLOYEES

Supporting sea-based employees
In addition to offering predominantly permanent positions, we employ other measures to retain our sea-based
employees on the ships registered under the German
flag. Before and after every sea voyage, e. g., we engage
in discussions in person with the captains, the head engineers and any of the other employees if requested. We
discuss the technical side of the journey, the performance
of employees and further deployment planning that takes
social aspects into account.

We place particular value in this context on the unrestricted contactability and expertise of the crew managers. From their work stations on land, they look after the
employees at sea. Many of these crew managers have
gone to sea themselves and therefore have a lot of experience and knowledge.
In order to strengthen the relationship between employees
on land and at sea, we organise events such as a joint
starter week for apprentices and meet-ups during the
Christmas holidays. Employees are also regularly given the
opportunity to visit H
­ apag-Lloyd ships to gain a better
understanding of the work done by their colleagues at sea.
Every manager, whether on land or at sea, is required to
assess how satisfied employees are in their day-to-day
roles and to take suitable action if needed. Managers can
obtain the support of the HR departments for this, e. g.
when organising related team-building activities.
Work-life balance — 401/103, 401-3
Our employees should be able to develop to their full po­
tential in their jobs. For this to happen, there needs to be an
appropriate balance between their work and personal life.

Our crew faces the particular challenges of long periods
away from their families and social networks, irregular
working hours, seven-day working weeks and limited
leisure options. We counteract these with relatively short
deployment times that are as flexible as possible for the
crew on the ships registered under the German flag. If
possible, we also take account of personal requests in
our deployment planning, e. g. for special personal events
such as births, confirmations, communions or special
weddings. In addition, family members of the crew, such
as spouses, partners or children, are allowed to travel on
board with them.

In keeping with our corporate culture, the HR departments
and local managers develop measures which also exceed

Co-determination — 102-41, 407/103
The opportunity for employees to take part in important
decision-making processes and suggest their own ideas
also have a positive impact on employee retention. Works
councils and similar bodies are established in Germany
and other countries that enable employee and employer
representatives to communicate in a confidential and constructive manner. In principle, however, all employees can
make suggestions on improvements.
In Germany, it is only possible to implement action on a
lot of issues with the participation of the Works Council,
e. g. integration, restructuring, reorganisation and agreement on employee appraisal systems. In other countries,
works councils (mainly Europe) or similar bodies (South
America and the west coast of the USA) also usually have
co-deter­mination and/or information rights in the event
of reorganisations and mergers if they will result in job
changes or job losses. Throughout Europe, national works
councils also work closely with the local company management.

Fair wages and salaries — 102-12, 102-13
For us, an attractive work environment includes fair pay for
employees. We are a member of the employers’ association Hamburg Shipowners’ Association (Verein Hamburger
Rheder), which, in turn, is a member of the Community of
Employers’ Associa­tions of the Hamburg Transport Industry (Tarifgemeinschaft Verkehrsgewerbe Hamburg). The
pay agreements between the Community and ver.di are
applicable to our employees on land in Germany, although
not to senior staff in accordance with Section 5 (3) of the
German Works Constitution Act (BetrVG). The agreements
include minimum working conditions and minimum salaries. Our crew on ships registered under the German
flag is covered by independent pay agreements which we
have entered into with ver.di and the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) through our membership of
the collective bargaining community of the German Shipowners’ Association (VDR). There are plans to extend the
level of coverage by agreements that have been entered
into with the ITF. In addition, we apply the regulations of
the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC).
When calculating and agreeing on remuneration in line
with duties, performance and the market in general, it is
irrelevant to us whether the employee is male or female.
The equal treatment of women and men means that gender cannot, of course, be a factor in determining salaries.
Under our “Global Code of Ethics”, we are committed
to complying with all local guidelines on working times,

As a service company, our employees’ skills and qualifications are extremely
important to us. Throughout the Group, our goal is to develop our employees as
effectively as possible and to fill vacant positions, particularly for highly skilled
workers and managers, from within our own ranks. — NfR

In 2017, we invested a total of EUR 5.2 million
(­Hapag-Lloyd AG: around EUR 2 million) worldwide in
training and further education for our employees and
also im­­plemented a large number of other internal quali­
fication and further training measures. — NfR

Our Hamburg-based apprentices at sea complete group
training lasting several months, which takes place on land
at a training centre and on our training ships. This training
focuses on team building and occupational safety and
also includes joint shore leave, leisure activities and various special training modules and courses. The Marine HR
department looks after the apprentices. — NfR

TRAINING

Our apprentices start performing demanding tasks,
applying what they have learned in practice and obtaining
valuable experience during their training. This enables us
to foster not just their specialist knowledge, but also their
personal development and social skills, including team

FURTHER EDUCATION
The aim of our further education programmes is to en­­­
sure that our employees worldwide are able to meet the
increasing demands of their job roles. At the same time,
we see the extensive training opportunities as an in­strument for increasing employee retention at H
­ apag-Lloyd.
The range of further education options includes webbased and virtual classroom training as well as face-to-­
face events. In 2017, we invested an average of around
25 hours (Hapag-Lloyd AG: 20 hours) per employee
in further education. The measures that are implemented
individually are evaluated internally on a regular basis
to review their success. — NfR — 404-1
Global Staff Dialogue (GSD) — 404-3
At the end of 2016, we launched the GSD worldwide. It
helps us to obtain structured information on the need for
further employee training globally and represents a milestone in our employee development measures. — NfR
The GSD is an annual discussion between employees
on land and managers, where developments during the
year are discussed, joint development targets are set and
suitable measures for further employee development are
agreed on and then implemented by the HR department.
These include, e. g., advanced training such as MS Office
courses, training on travel safety and intercultural skills,
and customised team-building activities. The Global
­Business Support also offers web-based training globally,
e. g. on sustain­ability issues. The purpose of the GSD
is also to assess em­­ployees’ potential in relation to their
continuing pro­fessional development. — NfR
The next planned step is to incorporate the information
from the GSD into a learning management system
which will be used to manage and review agreed measures. — NfR
Talent Development Programme (TDP)
Our three-year TDP is managed locally by the regions
and aimed at employees on land whose performance is
excellent and whose potential for development is regarded
by us as high. The TDP develops our employees worldwide on both an individual and collective level, and they
are closely supported by instructors from the areas of HR
management and development. — NfR

Management Career Programme (MCP)
Our multi-year MCP is centrally managed from our headquarters in Hamburg and is tailored towards managers
on land who have the potential to progress from the fourth
to the third management level. Each of the current 56
(Hapag-Lloyd AG: 15) participants is invited once a year
to a high-calibre seminar on the topics of management,
strategy, finance, project management and change management, among others. We are currently conducting
a fundamental reform of the MCP and adapting both the
overall concept and the content to the future needs of
­Hapag-Lloyd. The new manager development programme
is set to be launched in 2018. — NfR
Expertise management system
To enable the targeted professional and personal develop­
ment of our crew on the ships ­registered under the
German flag, we have implemented an expertise management system for them. Together with their managers,
they identify their training needs in regular staff dialogue
sessions and agree on suitable measures for their further
training. These range from IT training to stress management. Corresponding advanced training measures are then
implemented by the Marine HR department. — NfR — 404-3

OPEN CORPORATE CULTURE
Hapag-Lloyd is an international company that has grown rapidly in recent years,
partly as a result of mergers. Over the decades, we have maintained the values and
traditions which are rooted in our Hamburg origins and which shape our corporate
culture. They influence our daily activities and contribute to our success.

DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
— 405/103, 406/103

tolerance of distinctive cultural features and differences,
which also benefits them outside the organisation.

As a global company with offices on all five continents,
di­versity among our staff plays a central role and is a
normal feature for us. With their various cultural and social
backgrounds, our employees bring different perspectives,
experiences and ways of thinking to our Company,
there­by enriching it. We firmly believe that this allows us
to progress as a Company at all levels. We benefit from
the cultural, social and linguistic differences in our daily
communication and achieve better results thanks to the
different mentalities and perspectives. Furthermore, our
employees develop a better understanding and greater

We are expressly committed to the diversity
recommenda­tions of the Government Commission for
the German Corporate Governance Code and have
firmly incor­po­rated the objectives of the Diversity Charter
into our corporate culture. We foster the talents of all
our employees irrespec­tive of gender, nationality, ethnic origin, religion and ideology, disability, age, sexual
orientation and identity. One of our goals is to include
people with disabilities in our operational workflows and
the social life of our Company in the same way as any
employee. —102-12

We hire new employees worldwide solely on the basis of
their qualifications, motivation and performance ability. We
follow country-specific regulations in this respect, such as
the German General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG). For
our employees at sea, e. g. this can relate to their suitability for sailing, a high degree of flexibility and technical
manual skills.
As at 31 December 2017, the proportion of women
in management positions was around 12%. We want
to ­continue to increase our employees’ and managers’
awareness of the issue of diversity across the Group
through regular events, such as self-marketing for women,
the Women’s Business Talk, intercultural awareness
simulation and other forms of intercultural training. The
Women’s Business Club (WBC) in Hamburg is particularly
successful. Since 2015, young female managers have
been offered opportunities for further training as part of
this initiative and can engage with experienced female
managers at the third and fourth management level. We
want to roll this idea out in all regions in 2018. — 405-1

COMMUNICATION BETWEEN EMPLOYER
AND EMPLOYEE
A positive relationship between employer and employee
is important to us. For this reason, we place great importance on flat hierarchies, short decision-making channels
and transparent communication throughout the various
management levels.
Our top management practises an open-door culture.
In principle, this means that every employee can get in
contact with every manager. For example, employees can
register for “Breakfast with the Board” every two months
or invite an Executive Board member to a department
meeting as part of the “Book a Board Member” initiative.
They can get to know second and third level managers
better at events such as the weekly “Lunch with the Management”.
To ensure that mistakes do not remain undiscovered
and that employees can learn from them, honest feedback
is expressly desired at H
­ apag-Lloyd. We train our man­
agers to provide prompt and regular feedback as well as
to actively request it. And naturally, we also ask our em­‑
ployees to give feedback to their managers.
In 2016, we conducted a Group-wide survey of our
employees on land based on the Organizational Health
Index (OHI) survey developed by McKinsey, with a total of
4,154 employees taking part. The aim of the survey was
to obtain an assessment of the Company’s performance
drivers. Out of more than 1,300 global companies, we
achieved a result at the upper end of the third quartile. As
a result of the survey, we launched the Global Staff Dialogue for all employees worldwide. We also discussed the
OHI results with the departments on a solution-oriented
basis during 67 workshops with around 800 participants
worldwide.

HEALTH AND
SAFETY
EXCELLENT CARE ON BOARD:

A medical emergency on the open sea is
always something to be taken seriously.
If a medical emergency is reported on a
­Hapag-Lloyd ship, it can be handled remotely
by a medical advisory service. Key informa­tion
such as the type of injury and the pa­tient’s
vital signs are communicated by email and
phone. Hapag-Lloyd is also currently test­
ing a comprehensive telemedicine solution
which involves a live (video/audio) connection
being established between the ship’s crew
and the doctors in the event of an emergency,
allowing advice to be given and a possible
diagnosis to be made in real time.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

— 403/103

Hapag-Lloyd pays a great deal of attention to workplace safety, health promotion and
preventive measures. To maintain the long-term ability of our employees to work, we
have implemented high health and safety standards across the Group that exceed the
minimum statutory requirements. This also enhances our attractiveness as an
employer. — NfR

Due to the importance of occupational health and safety,
these issues primarily rest with the HR department on land
both at Group level and in the individual regions. Furthermore, it is the responsibility of managers to ensure that
all the relevant regulations are complied with and that the
Group’s internal guidelines are implemented. — NfR
We already meet very high occupational health and safety
standards at present. Our goal is to continue doing so,
while also transferring local best practices to other locations. — NfR
Our Occupational Safety Committee in Germany meets
on a regular basis. The committee comprises the company management, the occupational safety manager, the
company doctor, representatives of the Works Council
and the safety officers. At these meetings, the members
discuss occupational health and safety issues, agree on
areas of action and take decisions on measures to be
implemented. — NfR
In 2006, we implemented a Works Council agreement in
Germany, which clearly subscribes to the workplace health
promotion. It serves as a guidance framework enabling
us to identify areas of action and implement measures to
improve health promotion within the Group. — NfR

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 7

Fleet management is responsible for employees at sea.
Its duty is to ensure that ship operations are safe. The
Group’s occupational health and safety standards also
apply on board our ships. These are embedded within
operational workflows via our safety management system
(SMS), which encompasses all our occupational safety
processes and measures. Risks and the effectiveness
of the activities are also documented as part of hazard
assessments, as well as in reports, such as the Occupational Health Report for our ships registered under the
German flag. — NfR
Areas of action can take two forms: preventive, such as
inspections, reports from our ships or the procurement of
the latest safety equipment, and corrective, such as accident investigations, reporting of near accidents, changes
to the law or the identification of hazards through research
and scientific studies. The results of the analyses are used
to develop corresponding safety measures. — NfR

SAFE SHIP OPERATIONS

33

— 403/103

Fleet management is primarily responsible for ensuring that our ship operations are
safe. We focus heavily here on our employees’ health and safety on board, and
this is also closely linked to protecting our fleet, cargo and the environment. — NfR

The safety management system (SMS)
In the interest of sustainable development, we have,
among other things, iden­tified four areas in our SMS that
reflect the objectives of our Safety and Environmental
Protection Policy: — NfR
– S
 afety on board: our safety system is characterised
by a comprehensive package of preventive and other
mea­sures – ranging from state-of-the-art technical
standards to operational workflows – which allows us
to guarantee the safety of people and ships as well
as cargo and our property. — NfR
– O
 ccupational health and safety: an extensive and
appropriate range of safety measures enables us to
minimise as effectively as possible the risks to human
life and health that result from operating a ship. — NfR
– M
 aritime security: with effective security systems that
prevent non-authorised persons from gaining access,
e. g., we can identify and minimise the risk of outside
attacks. — NfR
– E
 nvironmental protection: our safety systems also
include measures to prevent or minimise environmental
pollution. — NfR
To ensure an efficient implementation of the SMS, it is
necessary that H
­ apag-Lloyd managers and employees
fully subscribe to our Safety and Environmental Protection
Policy. There are clear processes and principles in place
to ensure that employees are familiar with the content of
the policy and that they apply this policy, along with the
SMS and other standards and guidelines within their area
of responsibility at all times. — NfR

As part of our management review system, we con­­
tinu­­ously develop our SMS – e. g., through in­spections
and regular meetings. Based on reports from our
ships on every incident, accident or near accident,
we decide whether operational workflows need to be
improved. We communicate these decisions to the
ships affected, implement measures and evaluate their
success. — NfR
Audits
We conduct internal and external audits to ensure that all
statutory and internal requirements regarding occupational
health and safety are met. The internal audits to verify
compliance with the ISM and ISPS Codes1 as well as the
ISO, OHSAS and MLC regulations2 are conducted by us
annually on all our ships. We carry out external ISM, ISPS
and MLC audits on each of our ships every two-and-a-half
years, and the ISO 9001 and 14001 audits occur regularly
on a set number of ships. — NfR
For newly built ships, the ISM/ISO/ISPS and MLC audits
take place within six months. Any deviations from the
requirements are documented in audit reports. We are
required within a clearly defined period to implement corresponding remedial measures, which are subsequently
evaluated. — NfR
In 2017, all certificates, the so-called Safety Management Certificates (SMCs) and International Ship Security
Certificates (ISSCs), which confirm compliance with
the ISM and ISPS Codes were issued without any reservations. — NfR

1	ISM = International Safety Management;
ISPS = International Ship and Port Facility Security
2	OHSAS = Occupational health and safety Assessment Series;
MLC = Maritime Labour Convention

34

H E A LT H A N D S A F E T Y | S A F E S H I P O P E R AT I O N S

In all, we carried out more than 100 internal and 50 external audits in 2017. — NfR
Port state control (PSC)
Every port state is permitted to check any ships docked
in its ports without giving prior notice to establish whether
the ships are in compliance with the applicable international agreements on occupational health and safety regu­
lations which the port state has ratified. These port state
controls (PSCs) involve examining the ships’ condition
and equipment and checking that they are being operated
properly by their crew. — NfR
In nine regions at present, several countries have signed
Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and joined together
to create port state controls. These regional PSC organisations also conduct concentrated inspection campaigns
for certain key issues. In 2017, these were: “Safety of
Navigation” (Paris, Tokyo, Viña del Mar, Indian Ocean, Abuja
& Black Sea MoU), “Life Saving Appliances” (Caribbean
MoU) and “Crew Familiarization for Enclosed Space Entry”
(Riyadh MoU). — NfR
In 2017, 90 PSCs were conducted on our ships registered under the German flag (previous year: 71) and an
average of 0.66 deficiencies (previous year: 0.69) were
identified. The comparison with the average global
deficiency rates (e. g. Paris MoU 2,27 (2017) and Tokyo
MoU 2,57 (2016)) and the positive development of our
deficiency rates in recent years are evidence of the success of our safety management system. — NfR

Crisis management
In order to prevent or minimise injuries to people and
da­mage to ships and the Company in crisis situations, we
created an Emergency Manual. It clearly specifies the
following priorities: — NfR

2.
3.
4.

Save lives
Save the ship
Protect the environment
Prevent damage to the Company

— NfR

If an incident occurs, we deploy an Emergency Response
Team (ERT) comprising representatives and experts from
all the relevant H
­ apag-Lloyd departments as well as representatives from external institutions. The team has the
necessary expertise to effectively coordinate the situation
and, if necessary, provide the required assistance. The
team is contactable around the clock for our own ships
and for charter ships. Clear responsibilities and reporting
channels ensure that, in crisis situations, the Executive
Board can also be informed as quickly as possible. — NfR
Piracy and terrorism
In contrast to issues relating to (occupational) safety, where
there are clear cause-and-effect relationships, piracy, and
in particular terrorism, cannot be predicted. Although there
are rough guidelines for averting danger, such as the IMO’s
Best Management Practices for Protec­tion Against Somalia
Based Piracy (BMP4), there is no consensus on which
regions exhibit which risks and how these should best be
dealt with. This makes it necessary to examine each situa­
tion individually and, if necessary, adopt measures. Further­
more, we place great importance on monitoring different,
unrelated sources of information, as they provide us with a
comprehensive view of which risks the regions traversed
might exhibit.
All our ships follow the recommendations of BMP4 as a
matter of principle. In addition, we perform ship and route-­
specific risk assessments for every ship based on inde­
pendent sources of information. We review and update these
assessments continuously, at least once a year, to ensure
that we can respond to changes immediately.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
The safety of our employees and the protection of their health are our top priority.
To ensure that we fulfil this priority in the long term, we develop specific p
­ reventive
and corrective measures. We maintain a continuous focus here on the different
­c hallenges faced by our employees on land and at sea. — NfR

OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY

— 403/103

For the majority of our employees on land, the risk of
in­jury or illness is not particularly high, as they primarily
perform office tasks. Employees who work in facility
management or in kitchens, warehouses or ports, as well
as employees on business trips, receive training from
us in accordance with the specific requirements and risks.
Business trips, e. g., involve different safety risks depending on the destination, and we address these as part
of travel safety training. In 2017, we also set up a central
emergency phone line that our employees worldwide
can call if they need to. — NfR — 403-3
Ship operations involve specific hazards, such as noise pollution, sun exposure, high temperatures in the workplace,
irregular sleeping times and the risk of accidents occurring,
e. g., as a result of the motion of the ship during travel
and the physically confined conditions on board (see Safe
ship operations on p. 33 f.) — NfR — 403-3
We record and investigate all safety-related incidents within
the Group and adopt appropriate measures to improve
occupational safety and prevent accidents. In 2017, 55
(Hapag-Lloyd AG: 23) accidents were reported worldwide,
29 (Hapag-Lloyd AG: 16) of which involved employees at
sea. In 2017, there were no fatal accidents either on land
or at sea. — NfR — 403-2

For employees on land, accidents resulting in at least one day’s

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH
We counteract the biggest health risks on land, including
lack of movement, posture damage and vision disorders,
using a wide range of health-promoting and ­preventive
measures. We are particularly proud of the c
­ ompany sports
club, which was set up in Hamburg in 1953 and has around
500 members. In summer, we regularly organise exercise
initiatives, such as the step-counting competition in 2017.
We also offer preventive medical examinations in Germa­ny,
such as eye examinations, to identify any in­capacitating
conditions at an early stage and coun­ter­act them.
Focusing on prevention
A particular feature of our health promotion activities is
our role as a principal supporter of the company health
insurance fund pronovaBKK. Through our activities on the
Board of Directors, we play an active role in structuring
and directing the health insurance fund. This allows us
to work with the fund to develop and implement health-­
promoting measures and preventive medical examinations
for our employees in Germany. For example, employees
on land receive free preventive medical examinations such
as bowel cancer screening, skin screening, cataract and
osteoporosis examinations and flu vaccinations.

per 1,000 employee (Hapag-Lloyd AG: 13.1)

For employees at sea, reportable accidents resulting in at least
three days’ absence are included.

36

H E A LT H A N D S A F E T Y | O C C U PAT I O N A L H E A LT H A N D S A F E T Y

At our Hamburg facilities, our company doctor service
offers additional health services. These include primary
care for acute complaints, identification of risk factors via
blood tests and individual consultation for employees,
in particular on health and nutrition. In partnership with
pronovaBKK, we also run health days on specific issues
once or twice a year. We will continue to expand these
measures and initiatives in the future.
Globally we always adapt the initiatives developed and
implemented by us to particular regional requirements.
For instance, Region North America supported the Breast
Cancer Awareness Month in the USA once again in 2017.
In other countries such as the UK, we work with external
consultancies which employees can contact in confidence
if they are experiencing emotional difficulties.

Health management at sea
On the open sea, the physical distance from medical care
poses particular challenges in terms of our health man­
agement activities. We therefore take specific meas­ures
to protect the health of our employees at sea. For example, as a basic prerequisite for deployment on our ships,
­em­­ployees must be certified as fit to work at sea in accordance with the requirements of the Marine Labour Convention (MLC), which are incorporated into marine labour law.
We continuously monitor these through software-assisted
reviews in order to assess the validity of our employees’
certifications as fit to work at sea.
Furthermore, we minimise the health risks of employees at
sea through preventive measures such as medical checks
and voluntary vaccinations. In 2017, e. g., we administered
numerous vaccinations worldwide and trained our cooks
in healthy eating on board.
Our high technical communication standards on board
also allow us to provide medical care with the help of
land-based medical centres. In addition, we are continuously working to make improvements in the area of
telemedicine, e. g., through live videos or audio links with
doctors.

DANGEROUS GOODS

37

— 306/103

Some of the goods transported by us are classified as dangerous goods under the
IMDG Code (International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code). These include con­
tainerised bulk goods, mineral oil products and chemicals. To guarantee the safety of
people and ships when transporting these types of goods, we ensure that both our
employees on land and at sea, and our customers adhere strictly to applicable laws
and internal guidelines. — NfR

For the transportation of dangerous goods, our most
im­portant principle is that we do not transport any dangerous goods unless they meet all international, national and
local laws and guidelines in full. These include the IMDG
Code, 49 CFR (US regulations), the German Ordinance on
the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Sea (GGV-See) and
the German Dangerous Goods Officer Ordinance (GbV).
Apart from these, there is a range of additional laws and
regulations which are specific to transportation companies
and which we adhere to. — NfR
Various aspects of a particular good are used to identify
the potential danger that it exhibits. These include the
dangerous goods class, the global UN number, the chemical composition, the external temperature and the moisture content. This potential danger determines the specific
requirements for transportation. — NfR
Regulations and processes
To overcome the complex challenges arising from the
transportation of dangerous goods, we have implemented
further regulations that exceed statutory requirements
in line with the “Rules of Good Seamanship”. For example
to protect crew members and the cargo in the event of
a fire, dangerous goods may not be stored behind or in
front of superstructures in which the crew members live.
Dangerous goods may not be stored on the outward sides
of the ships either in order to protect the cargo from being
struck by waves, from pirate attacks or in the event of a
ship collision. — NfR

“The international transportation of dangerous
goods is a particular
challenge due to the
large number of local,
national and international
laws and regulations.”
Ken Rohlmann, Senior Director
Cargo Service / Dangerous Goods

All mandatory regulations and work processes relating
to dangerous goods are detailed in our ­Hapag-Lloyd
Dangerous Goods Manual. This manual is used by our
dangerous goods experts as well as by all relevant parties,
such as ship planners and Port Terminal Operations. — NfR

S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 7 | H A PA G - L L O Y D A G

38

H E A LT H A N D S A F E T Y | D A N G E R O U S G O O D S

It also includes the Restricted List, which contains all the
goods that we do not transport for risk-related reasons
even though it would be legally permissible to do so. We
continually update this particular part of the manual,
if it is necessary to do so as a result of changes in risk
assessments. — NfR
We ensure that dangerous goods are properly handled
in ports and on ships by our dangerous goods experts in
the various regions. They examine every single dangerous
good to check that it complies with statutory requirements
and that it is loaded on board in accordance with the applicable laws. The dangerous goods experts report regularly
to the central ­Hapag-Lloyd dangerous goods officer. — NfR
The Cargo Patrol System
We are also the only shipping company to have established a system that can search for undeclared dangerous
goods using key words. Our Cargo Patrol System, as it
is called, has received several international awards. In
2017, we inspected our cargo for dangerous goods, and
in 2,711 cases we refused to transport what were un‑­
declared dangerous goods. Our long-term aim is to make
Cargo Patrol available to our competitors in partnership
with IBM in order to improve safety in the transport chain
across the industry. — NfR
Dangerous goods training
Well-trained employees are a key factor in identifying
irregu­larities and conspicuous features. The ­Hapag-Lloyd
dangerous goods officer therefore provides the relevant
employees, e. g., captains and cargo officers, with regular

Initiatives and memberships
We are both a founding member and an active Board
member of the Cargo Incident Notification System (CINS).
CINS is a unique association of carriers, insurers and
experts which was established in 2011 to collect and
analyse worldwide information about accidents involving
cargo or containers in a shared database. It also provides
companies with a platform to engage in a transparent
exchange of experiences and best practices. The initiative
aims to identify positive developments at an early stage,
as well as those requiring critical action, and to improve
operational safety in the transport chain. — NfR
The high number of leaks and incorrect declarations is
the biggest challenge in this area. To overcome this problem, CINS draws up specific sets of guidelines, three
of which have been published to date. Another four are
in the process of being drawn up. Within this context,
we also report all our Cargo Patrol findings in order to warn
our competitors about incorrectly declared cargo. — NfR
In addition, we are involved in the dangerous goods unit of
the German Shipowners’ Association (VDR). — NfR

T H E T R A N S P O R TAT I O N O F C H A R C O A L — NfR

Charcoal poses an increased fire hazard to our ships,
though it does not have to be declared as a dangerous good. An internal requirement therefore stipulates
that charcoal cargo which is not labelled as a dangerous good must always be declared as special cargo.
This enables us to take special preventive measures,
such as storing it on deck in an accessible manner to
ensure that a potential fire can be tackled effectively.

DIGITALISATION AND
DIGITAL SECURITY
A L W AY S I N T H E K N O W :

The Fleet Support Center has been com­
piling and analysing infor­mation about
­Hapag-Lloyd fleet operations and processing
it for further use within the Company since
2013. For example, it assists with optimising
ship utilisation, creating consumption profiles
or avoiding non-operational time at ports,
thereby making a significant contribution to
lowering costs.

DIGITALISATION
Digitalisation provides us with opportunities to make our business operations and
processes more efficient and secure and to optimise communication with our customers. We carefully examine the associated risks and rewards in order to make
optimal use of the potential offered by technological developments. — NfR

It is our fundamental aim to increase quality and revenue
by means of digital solutions and, at the same time,
reduce costs. In this regard, we have been successfully
supported by digital systems for decades. In the 1990s,
e. g., we introduced the freight information system (FIS),
in which we systematically record key data about cargo
along the transport chain and make it available to our
business partners, customers and other related parties.
Based on the “one file per shipment” system, we ensure
that data for each shipment is only entered once and that
it can be easily retrieved by any users in our global network.

We established the Digital Channel & Incubation Unit (DCIU)
in 2017. This new specialist department will work to­gether
in the future with the various regions and our IT department to develop new, digitally available services and
business models.
Digital solutions at the Fleet Support Center (FSC)
The FSC was established in 2013 and serves as a point
of contact for issues relating to ship operations. Among
other things, it coordinates the issues for which the
responsibilities have not been clearly de­fined and for
which the regions or specialist departments have pursued
different approaches, such as in stowage planning, i. e.
planning the loading of ships, and in speed and trim management, i. e. optimising the ship’s speed and trim at
sea. The FSC enables us to make our processes more
efficient and reduce costs. — NfR
Using business intelligence tools, such as QlikView,
Tableau and Navigator Insight (NI), the FSC manages the
Group-wide reporting of issues relating to ship operations.
It continuously works on improving data quality in the
systems, and in 2017 it implemented data availability in
the different areas. — NfR

“The FSC helps us
to optimise processes
and reduce costs.”

The NI software can be used to create detailed consumption profiles of our ships. At least once every 24 hours,
the system uniformly records fuel-related data, such as
quality, bunker supplies, daily consumption, time of fuel
conversion on journeys in protected areas and eventrelated information, such as arrival, departure, waiting
times at sea and bunker processes. The data is auto­mati­
cally validated when it is being entered. With this tool,
we can also ensure that reporting is standardised for
charter ships. — NfR

D I G I TA L I S AT I O N | D I G I TA L I S AT I O N A N D D I G I TA L S E C U R I T Y

The fleet decision support system (DSS)
The FSC uses the fleet DSS to collate weather, geographical, route and operating data from various different tools,
including from the NI system, and to visualise this data if
needed. This enables us to monitor our fleet in port and at
sea with relatively little input. — NfR
The system alerts us to any discrepancies between actual
and expected values, such as a deviation from the suggested route or from the expected bunker consumption.
Based on this, we develop improvements and evaluate their
success using the fleet DSS. In addition, we can use the
data evaluated to optimise the capacity utilisation of our
ships while in port, whereby the system suggests structural
changes on board the ships based on the cargo mix. — NfR
The data analysis also helps us to reduce operating idle
times. Effective stowage planning facilitates swift loading
and unloading, enabling us to implement a lower speed
profile when the ship is at sea. The system also provides

41

our captains with a range of information, including on
weather and currents, so that they can optimise the ship’s
trim, speed and route. — NfR
Positive results
In 2017, these measures saved us a double-digit millioneuro amount in bunker purchases and increased the
capacity utilisation of our ships by 4,000–5,000 TEU per
month. The FSC also plays a key part in ensuring that
routes are provided as scheduled, which has a major
effect on adherence to timetables and customer satis­
faction. — NfR
We share information about the data recorded in the fleet
DSS with relevant business partners on a transparent
basis. This enables us to use the empirical data regarding
structural changes on chartered ships for our own fleet
and to examine the extent to which our business partners
adhere to the contractually agreed minimum performance
of their ships. — NfR

ROUTE OPTIMISATION
Ensuring that our fleet operates efficiently and as scheduled is a challenging task for
us, since other factors continually arise in day-to-day operations and have to be
coordinated. For example, currents and water depth have a major effect on the speed
selected. Improved digital solutions enable us to incorporate these variables into
our decision-making at an early stage and coordinate our routes accordingly. — NfR

Every day, our ships cover vast distances on the world’s
oceans. When planning these journeys, we have to take
into consideration both strict timetables and the significant
volume of bunker consumed. By selecting an optimal
route, we can ensure that delivery is on time and that
costs and emissions are reduced. When choosing an optimal route, we incorporate strategic, tactical and opera­
tional factors into our considerations, although the safety
of people, ships and cargo is always the top priority. — NfR
Strategic aspects include the arrangement of the schedule, timetable planning and the distance to the destination.
Here, we always use the best-possible data basis, as the
same route can have distinctive seasonal features, e. g.,
which we must take into account when arranging the
schedule. — NfR

We incorporate tactical aspects into route optimisation
at shorter notice, e. g. if difficult weather conditions mean
that alternative sea routes are better. — NfR
We primarily decide on operational aspects in day-to-day
operations during the journey, e. g. by taking advantage
of favourable winds or currents. — NfR
The Fleet Support Center provides assistance at all
sta­ges of the route planning and implementation pro­
cess. It makes important data available (see
Digitalisation, p. 40 f.) and communicates with service
provi­ders, such as companies that specialise in weather
forecasts. If needed, it also acts as a qualified point
of contact for the fleet and various specialist departments. — NfR

DATA PROTECTION AND DIGITAL SECURITY

43

— 418/103

The importance of protecting personal and operational data and maintaining digital
security has increased significantly in recent years, both for our customers and
suppliers, and for our employees. And also for us, as a global service company, these
issues are extremely relevant for ensuring smooth and secure business
operations. — NfR

A particular challenge for us in the area of data protec­
tion is the heterogeneous nature of the legal situation in
individual countries. In this regard, the EU General Data
Protection Regulation, which comes into force in May
2018, is one of the most stringent regulatory frameworks in the world and provides us and our customers
with a further important basis for ensuring data protection. — NfR
We are also continuously confronted with new IT threats
which we have to protect ourselves and our customers
against. For us, this means that we not only review our
technical infrastructure on a continuous basis, but also
train our employees on these issues. — NfR
We have already implemented very high technical and
procedural standards in many areas of our Company,
en­­abling us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.
The standards relate not just to people, ships and cargo,
but also to the security of our IT landscape and to data
protection. They enable us to meet our customers’ spe­cif­­ic
requirements, such as those placed on us by the central
Compliance and Legal departments of major customers
as a result of the introduction of the EU General Data Pro­
tection Regulation. Furthermore, sensitive data, such
as employee data and information about cargo, is subject
to separate technical and legal requirements which we
factor into all our measures. — NfR
Our employees and external service providers are always
required by us to comply with the highest security stan­­­
dards. Whenever we handle sensitive data, such as
through the use of cloud solutions, we use special processes to ensure the greatest-possible data security.
Here, we decidedly analyse, assess and document the
risks being entered into. — NfR

Organisational integration of IT security and
data protection
Responsibility for data protection and data security within
our Company does not lie with one individual organisational unit, but rather with the respective business units
worldwide. The Corporate Data Protection Office, which
is located at our headquarters in Hamburg, advises the
central departments, regions and areas, on compliance
with standards under data protection law. — NfR
Almost every region and every area has a data protection
officer. This person ensures that the Group’s standards and
the local regulatory requirements are implemented, and
is available to employees and external parties on site as a
point of contact. — NfR
An IT security team is responsible for the security of our
central IT systems and for monitoring, managing and
improving them. In order to stay up to date with current
threats, the team maintains continuous communication
with external security experts. Security incidents, such as
cyberattacks and emails containing malware, are logged
via a ticket system and processed by the team. — NfR
Security of the operating systems
A separate security review is conducted for the security of
the operating systems on our ships. The systems essential
for ship operations are not connected to our IT system
on land, which means that there is currently no risk of
cyberattacks. However, we will prospectively have to take
preventive security measures as soon as we acquire new
ships that have technical external access capability. — NfR
We are aware of these new requirements and are actively
preparing for them – also so that we can meet the requirements of the ISM Code in 2021 (see Safe ship operations,
p. 33 f.). In addition, the International Association of

Classification Societies, which sets the minimum technical standards in shipping, has decided to prospectively
incorporate a cybersecurity test into its classification
programme. The initiative aims to implement mandatory
security standards in 2021 which, among other things,
address the increased risk caused by operational technology applications on ships, such as remote access to the
main engine. As such, cybersecurity will in future join the
other conventional aspects of a ship’s security and seaworthiness. — NfR
Informing and training employees
We place great value on ensuring that our employees are
aware of security issues and we train them accordingly
on how to handle information and data responsibly. Here,
we pursue a blended-learning approach which combines
several methods of learning. When changes to the law
occur or new employees are hired, we generally conduct
web-based training and on-site training with our data protection experts. Areas that handle sensitive data receive
training from us on specific issues as part of risk-oriented
corporate management. — NfR
At the start of 2018, we will introduce a new web-based
training concept worldwide which will be supplemented by
other blended-learning tools, such as virtual team meetings and FAQ sessions. — NfR
Data protection enquiries
Both our employees and local citizens contact us with
questions on the issue of data security. Usually, they
are looking for more information about how their data is
processed by our Company. We are developing new
pro­cesses so that we are prepared for an increase in
enquiries and can promptly provide detailed information
to those concerned. — NfR
We did not record any concrete complaints about violations of data protection policies in 2017. — NfR — 418-1

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 7

We received an enquiry from the authorities in Hamburg
about our video surveillance system at our Ballindamm
offices. We were able to resolve the situation in dialogue
with the authorities. — NfR
Outlook
The experiences of the last year, in particular the NotPetya
ransomware attack in summer 2017, have highlighted
that the shipping sector is exposed to the same risks as
other areas of the logistics industry. In future, it will therefore become more and more important for us to devote
significant attention to the integrity and accessibility of our
IT systems – and to go beyond legal requirements in terms
of maintenance and security. The only way we can achieve
sustainable success with digital business models and processes is by having sufficient data protection and IT security measures. To enable this, we will increasingly implement
measures in the areas of endpoint security, security detection and security response. — NfR

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

— 302/103, 305/103, 306/103

We are keenly aware of our responsibility to protect the environment and the climate
as a result of our business activities. For more than 30 years, we have been im­p le­
menting measures to reduce and prevent CO 2 emissions. We also have a “no garbage
into the sea” policy, which we have been practising. Against the backdrop of c
­ hanges
in the global economic, legal and political environment, we regularly evaluate our
measures and modify them where necessary. — NfR

Our responsibility towards the environment centres on
our sustainability policy. This stipulates, among other
things, that we should all take practical measures at our
Company to prevent or reduce negative effects on the
environment. We ensure that this happens by adhering
­to a range of environmental standards and certifications
both at our sites and on our ships. The certifications
include the global environmental and quality management
standards ISO 9001 and 14001 as well as certifications
on energy efficiency (EEDI1 certification) and the prevention of oil, sewage and air pollution (including IOPP, ISPP
and IAPP2 certifications). — NfR

The external ISO 9001 and 14001 audits3 take place
annually, in all regions and at our headquarters. The certi­
fication for our integrated quality and environmental man­
age­ment system was renewed in 2015 for the fourth time
and reviewed in 2017 as part of the annual monitoring
audit by DNV GL. The audits for our quality and environmental management system focus on issues such as
occupational safety, employee training, customer focus
and evaluation of service providers. In 2017, a total of
over 140 (­Hapag-Lloyd AG: over 90) internal and external
audits were conducted worldwide. We use the results of
the audits to continuously revise our processes. — NfR

In organisational terms, environmental management for
land-based operations is centralised with the Sustain­abil­
ity Management team, although the QEM delegates at
the various locations ensure implementation globally. For
sea-based operations, the Fleet Management area, and
in particular the Environmental Management department,
are responsible. — NfR

We quantify the success of our measures by the degree
to which both Group-wide and local environmental and
quality objectives are achieved. We review these annually
and update them if necessary. In addition, the specific CO2
emis­sions per TEU-kilometre4 are expected to be cut by
20% by 2020 compared with the base year of 2016. — NfR

We regularly assess our compliance with the requirements of the standards and certifications as well as
with applicable environmental laws and regulations by
means of clearly defined processes and audits. With the
­­Hapag-Lloyd blueprint approach, we can ensure, e. g.,
that our sites worldwide have identical organisational
structures and integrated IT systems. — NfR

CLIMATE PROTECTION
AND REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS

— 102-11

Reducing the greenhouse gases released by our ships is the core aspect of our
actions to protect the climate. Even though we currently have a relatively young fleet,
we are continuously working to increase the climate friendliness of our ships. — NfR

EFFICIENT SHIPS

— 302/103

We place great value on using the latest technologies and
designs for the construction of new ships. However, we
also adhere to this principle when it comes to modernising
our fleet, and our excellent level of maintenance means
that our ships can remain in operation for longer than
average at up to 25 years. We have seen that investing in
the efficiency of our ships has a positive impact in the long
term on the environment and our competitiveness. — NfR
Specifications for newbuilds — 302-5
For every new ship that we build, we develop a design
based on the latest technical efficiency and environmental
standards. We use the energy efficiency design index
(EEDI) category to determine the success of these efforts.
It expresses the relationship between the engine output,
specific fuel consumption and CO2 factor on the one hand,
and the capacity and speed of the ship on the other, so
that an assessment of the energy efficiency can be made.
In 2017, we put three new ships in the ­Valparaiso Express
class into operation as well as two new ships in the A15
class. Due to the installation of the latest technologies,
their EEDI rating was around 40% to 60% below the IMO
reference line for similar ships. — NfR
Modernising the fleet to increase efficiency — 302-5
In order to increase the energy efficiency of our existing
fleet, we are gradually retrofitting our ships with the “cold
ironing” ship-to-shore connection on certain routes. This
means that power is supplied from the on-shore electricity
grid while the ship is docked at the port. As a result,
the auxiliary engine is no longer used to produce electricity, and therefore almost no emissions are released. In
2017, we finished retrofitting the Yantian Express, and a
further four ships are currently being retrofitted. In doing
so, we are complying with the provisions of Californian

“By using the latest technologies and d
­ esigns,
we can continuously

of our ships.”

legislation. However, modernisation work is still needed in
many ports in order to put in place the necessary technical
­pre­re­q­ui­sites. — NfR
We can also significantly reduce fuel consumption and
therefore CO2 emissions by modifying the bow shape and
propeller in line with the ships’ deployment profiles. These
alterations reduce water resistance, making it possible to
use engines with a lower output. In 2017, we modified the
propeller on the ­Hamburg Express and optimised the bow
shape on three ships in our fleet. — NfR

We are also installing more and more LED lights on board
and switching our seawater pumps to frequency control, which enables optimised load-dependent pumping.
These measures are also helping to cut CO2 emissions by
lowering electricity consumption on board. — NfR
However, our activities in this area extend beyond our
own fleet. In 2017, e. g., we successfully lobbied the
World Shipping Council (WSC) to commission an EEDI/
Safe Speed Study. Its purpose is to make a submission
to the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee
(MEPC) on guaranteeing safe ship operations while maximising the reduction of emissions. — NfR
Energy consumption in fleet operations — 302-1, 302-3
With our Safety Management Manual (SMM) and Ship
Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP), we have set
clear guidelines to keep our bunker consumption, i.e. our
fuel consumption, as low as possible. We continuously
monitor adherence to the guidelines. — NfR
Our bunker consumption in 2017 totalled 3.93 million
metric tonnes, which was a rise of around 25% on the
previous year (previous year: 3.14 million metric tonnes).
This increase was due to the growth of our fleet as a result
of the merger with UASC. Around 13% of total consumption (previous year: 16%) consisted of low-sulphur bunker
(MFO low sulphur and MDO). — NfR
Bunker consumption per slot (in terms of the container
TEU capacities on an annual average on a weighted

monthly average of all ships operated for us in 2017) also
decreased from 3.28 metric tonnes in 2016 to 2.85 metric
tonnes. — NfR

CUTTING EMISSIONS

The main drivers of our emissions are bunker consumption and bunker quality. Since 2007, we have cut our
specific CO2 emissions by around 46%5 through numerous measures. We want to ensure that this positive
trend continues. Our expressed target is to reduce CO2
emissions per TEU-kilometre6 by 20% by 2020 (base year
2016). — NfR — 305-1, 305-4

Furthermore, we are a member of the Global Logistics
Emissions Council (GLEC) and the EcoTransIT World
Initiative (EWI), an independent platform for transport
companies, shipping agents and logistics service providers. In both of these initiatives, we are working to develop
transparent evaluation criteria for the industry’s impact
on the environment, such as uniform calculation standards
for emissions. — NfR — 102-13
We also support the objectives of the International
Chamber of Shipping (ICS) as well as of the WSC and
the BIMCO for the reduction of CO2 emissions in current
negotiations with the IMO and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in order
to find the most effective ways of further reducing emissions in the shipping industry. — NfR — 102-13

Our customers can obtain transparent information about
the various emissions in their transport chain using the

The bunker that we purchase has an average sulphur
content of 2.26%. This puts us well below the maximum
amount of 3.5% required by the IMO for marine areas
outside emission control areas (ECAs). Special statutory
regulations on fuel quality apply to many of these special
protection zones in order to improve air quality in coastal
areas. As a member of the Trident Alliance and a par­
ticipant in political forums, we campaign to ensure that
the IMO’s decision to restrict sulphur content to 0.5%

ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER PROTECTION

51

— 306/103, 307/103

The waters that our ships travel through are sensitive ecosystems. We believe that we
have an obligation to protect them to the extent that we are able to. For this reason,
we not only comply with statutory requirements, but also attempt to exceed them
wherever this is possible and practical. We also require our partners to follow suit in
this regard. — NfR

BALLAST WATER
Ballast water enables ships to maintain their stability. To
protect maritime ecosystems and prevent the spread of
invasive species via ballast water, the IMO’s Ballast Water
Management Convention came into force in September 2017. It requires all container ships to implement a
specific ballast water management plan. Our entire fleet
already meets this requirement in full. In addition, a ballast
water treatment system to purify ballast water must be
installed on every ship within a mandatory time period of
up to seven years. — NfR
The US Coast Guard had already issued regulations to
protect American waters above and beyond the IMO’s
requirements. Only six ballast water treatment systems
worldwide currently meet these stringent requirements,
which is why exemptions are granted for a transition
period in individual cases. We obtained authorisation from
the US Coast Guard for our existing systems to be used
as alternative management systems for a transition period.
Meanwhile, we are in the process of gradually retrofitting
all our ships so that they meet the requirements of the
IMO and the US Coast Guard on time. — NfR

Zero

We regularly examine the water protection management
systems that we have already implemented. Here, e. g.,
we draw on the number of substances released which are
listed under the International Convention for the Prevention
of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) as well as on breaches
of ballast water guidelines. During the reporting period, no
such substances were released by our own ships, which
are managed by our Fleet Management unit, nor were there
any breaches of this kind. — NfR — 306-3, 307-1

SHIP RECYCLING

— 301/103

The protection of people and the environment is a high
priority for us that extends beyond the end of a ship’s
operations. Our Hapag-Lloyd Ship Recycling Policy
reflects our objective of minimising negative effects on
society and the natural environment when it comes to
recycling our ships as well. We therefore insist that every
newly built ship is equipped with an inventory of hazard­
ous materials (IHM). In addition, the shipyard which
recycles our ships must be certified in accordance with
ISO 14001 and guarantee that it provides positive and
safe working conditions. Furthermore, it must adhere to
the guidelines of the Hong Kong International Convention
for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships
even though they are not yet mandatory. And finally, to
ensure that downstream disposal is environmentally sound,
the shipyard should also fulfil the requirements of the
EU SRR (Ship Recycling Regulation) insofar as possible.

In 2017, we recycled six ships in total. We selected
a suitable shipyard for this purpose and drew up an IHM
for each ship. We also appointed a recognised neutral
organisation to determine the entire recycling process with
the shipyard and to monitor and document this process
as well.

Our Hapag-Lloyd Ship Recycling Policy highlights our objective of minimising the effects
on society and the natural environment when
it comes to recycling our ships as well.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

— 102-9, 102-10, 301/103, 307/103, 308/103, 414/103

In order to provide our services, we source a significant volume of goods and services from numerous suppliers worldwide. With procurement volumes that are often
large, in both material and financial terms, our sourcing activities make a value-adding contribution to Hapag-Lloyd.

The goods procured range from office materials and
re­placement parts for ships to containers, bunker and
even 19,870-TEU container ships. Services primarily
include transport and terminal services, but also maintenance, training and consultancy services. Due to the high
technical standards and legal requirements, which often
vary from region to region, as well as diversified market
structures in individual industries and regions, our procure­
ment structures are very complex. When making decisions
on sourcing, we also have to take into consideration our
agreements with partners in THE Alliance as well as any
effects on the Group’s capital structure.
In 2017, we procured goods and services worth around
EUR 8,335 million (Hapag-Lloyd AG: EUR 3,555 million)
(previous year: around EUR 7,336 million). The increase of
EUR 999 million was mainly due to the rise in our procurement volumes as a result of the merger with UASC.
Our core business consists of services. For this reason,
we do not calculate the percentage of renewable or
recyclable materials for externally procured materials.
However, when we decommission our ships, nearly all
the component parts are recycled (see Ship recycling,
p. 52). — 301-1, 301-2
Procurement organisation
When it comes to procurement, our main aim is to ensure
availability and quality at the best-possible price.
Our procurement activities are primarily organised in line
with demand and market structures. In order to optimally
manage our procurement activities, we have a Global
Procurement department which works with mandated procurement organisations to ensure the best-possible penetration of our purchased goods and services. Specifically,

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 7

this means harmonising procurement processes, utilising
the potential for pooling and creating transparency.
For make-or-buy/sell-or-lease or invest decisions which
require specialised knowledge, we have established
our own organisational units and put them in charge of
procurement.
For other needs, responsibility for procurement remains
with the regions and areas, although functional management here is also ensured by Global Procurement. In this
case, procurement managers from Global Procurement
provide staff in the different regions with strategic and
methodological support or actively assist them with the
implementation of suitable measures.
This organisational structure allows us to ensure the
best-possible quality of goods and services and to effectively combine it with organisational cost responsibility.
Furthermore, the standardised global processes and
systems, combined with the regional knowledge of the
markets and their requirements, ensure that we can make
optimal procurement decisions based on quality, availability and cost.
The mergers in recent years have significantly increased
the complexity of our supplier structure due to the larger
number of suppliers and purchased goods and services.
This increased again with the latest merger. For this
reason, we launched an extensive restructuring process
for Global Procurement. In 2017, e. g., we established
the new Methods, Processes and Controlling (GP MPC)
department. GP MPC assists the procurement areas, e. g.,
in clearly assigning roles and responsibilities, creating
efficiency in the procurement processes and increasing
the effectiveness of procurement activities.

M A N A G E M E N T A P P R O A C H | S U P P LY C H A I N

Supplier management — 308-2, 407-1, 414-2
Maintaining structured selection processes, assessing
and developing our suppliers and systematically identifying
and evaluating risks in the supply chain play a significant
part in developing long-term and trustful relationships with
our partners.
Our sustainability policies and QEM Manual are key
foun­da­tions of our supplier management system. Our
QEM Manual establishes a standardised approach for
qualifying and assessing suppliers. This ensures that
our suppliers have the same understanding of the basic
values of our partnership, irrespective of whether the procurement responsibility is regionally or globally based.
If we enter into a partnership, we require our business
partners to sign our supplier code of conduct or to have
their own standards in place with the same minimum
requirements which ensure that they share our company
values.
Our sourcing decisions are influenced by very different
factors. Depending on the nature of the regional market

55

and flexibility of the services available on the route, we are
sometimes only able to rely on a limited number of business partners, e. g. terminal service providers. Here, the
decision on whether we serve a particular route is followed
by a sourcing decision on how to cater for this service.
We continuously communicate with our selected service
providers in order to define and implement standards or
KPIs for optimising productivity and reducing occupational
safety incidents, for example. However, our sourcing
decisions are also influenced by more fundamental restrictions, such as political embargoes.
As part of the partnership, our service providers (vendors)
regularly inform our Procurement department of their
measures to improve the ecological and social effects of
their business activities and therefore differentiate themselves from their competitors. For instance, port and
ter­minal operators highlight how they lower the diesel con­
sump­tion of cranes, produce electricity in a way that
conserves resources or reduce truck waiting times. When
selecting vendors, we factor these criteria into our sourcing decision as well.

56

S U P P LY C H A I N | M A N A G E M E N T A P P R O A C H

Suppliers with large supply volumes currently fill out a
self-assessment every two years or are audited on issues
such as quality, compliance, employee matters, the use
of sub-contractors, IT security and the environment. Only
suppliers that fulfil our requirements are added to our
approved supplier list (ASL). If a supplier does not fulfil
our requirements, we make a record of deficiencies and
remedial measures. If these measures are not satisfactorily
implemented, we terminate the contract.

Procurement guidelines — 307-1, 419-1
We are also reviewing our procurement guidelines as part
of the restructuring. This currently involves a revision of
our present procurement guidelines and the introduction
of new reporting guidelines. To accommodate regional
differences, regional appendices that have been coordi­
nated with Global Procurement will be added to the
guidelines if necessary.
One of the aims of our new Company Car Policy, e. g., is
to reduce the CO2 emissions of our company car fleet. We
incentivise employees who are entitled to a company car
to choose one with lower CO2 emissions by granting them
a higher subsidy on their company car lease rate.
In 2017, there were no significant breaches of our eco­
logical or social standards in our supplier relationships
managed by Global Procurement. If the regions or areas
identify potential breaches in their areas of re­sponsibility,
remedial measures are established here as well
and subsequently reviewed.

Future development of procurement
The introduction of a global eProcurement tool is planned
for 2018. Its purpose is to harmonise processes, increase
efficiency and further professionalise our procurement
activities. The tool enables us to make information avail­
able globally about the business relationship with our
suppliers, assess them and manage both the process for
the agreement on objectives and the development of
sup­pliers. The eProcurement solution should in particular
create transparency and help us to develop sustainable
improvement measures or identify focus topics for areas of
activity. This will enable us to incorporate performance
criteria into future decisions on the awarding of contracts,
thereby ensuring that these decisions have been subject to
total-cost review. The measures for qualifying suppliers
will become transparent, which means that all mandated
procurement areas can use this information. As a result,
the eProcurement project will play an active part in
establishing and maintaining sustainable partnerships
with Hapag-Lloyd’s suppliers.

ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PROCUREMENT
Containers and fuel are a particularly important element of our procurement pro­
cesses. We have to take a range of different factors into consideration to ensure that
we adhere to the technical requirements, safety standards and environmental regu­
lations in these areas. At the same time, the changing requirements also lead to
sustainable innovations which we develop with the help of our strict selection criteria.

BUNKER PROCUREMENT

— 302-3, 302-5

In order to keep costs and emissions low, the bunker that
we procure must contain as much energy as possible. For
our fuels, we differentiate between distillates (MDO/MGO1)
and residual oils (IFO/HFO/ULSFO2), which have different
heating values. These heating values are calculated from
analysed ISO specifications, and we request them from
potential suppliers at the tendering stage so that we can
factor them into the selection process. Furthermore, an
independent assessor examines the volumes delivered and
takes samples for laboratory testing. Using the laboratory
values on aspects such as sulphur, ash, water and density,
the assessor can calculate the heating values. — NfR

( I N % ) ( 2 0 1 7 ) — NfR

In 2017, we obtained laboratory analyses for around
97% of deliveries. During the year, we procured a total
of 272,766 metric tonnes of distillates with a weighted
average of 42.54 MJ/kg and 3,399,819 metric tonnes of
residual oils with a weighted average of 40.39 MJ/kg. This
means that energy needs from bunker purchases were
around 149 million GJ. — NfR

CONTAINER PROCUREMENT
Container floors
The floors of containers are traditionally made of tropical wood. The floors are the part of the container that
becomes damaged most often, from transporting heavy
goods, e. g., and has to be replaced. Both the demand
for tropi­cal wood and environmental regulations have
increased worldwide. At the same time, the availability of­
tropical wood is decreasing, which is pushing up the cost.
Further­more, greater importance is being placed on en­
vironmental considerations in relation to the use of wood
and adhesives, which have to be disposed of as ha­zar­
dous waste. As a result of these factors, the development
of alternative types of container floors is becoming more
and more important.

2.26

Hapag-Lloyd

IMO peak value

In light of this, we have examined whether floors made
of recyclable used plastic or fast-growing bamboo, e. g.,
could be an alternative. However, we decided in favour of
our own internally developed containers with steel floors,
as they are environmentally friendly, clean, stable and
secure.

Around
25,000 TEU
of steel floor containers since 2015

Since 2015, we have procured around 25,000 TEU with
steel floors – around 1% of our total fleet. Our aim is to
further increase the percentage of our container fleet with
steel floors. At present, there are not enough suppliers
that are able to manufacture containers with steel floors.
By increasing the level of demand, we can incentivise
pro­ducers to expand their capacities. We are therefore
engaging in open discussions with competitors and con­
tainer leasing companies so that the use of steel floors
becomes more widespread. So far, we have been able to
convince two carriers and one leasing company in workshops to order their first series of the containers.
In partnership with the Institute of International Container
Lessors (IICL) and the Container Owners Association
(COA), we are also working to develop innovative container standards.
Reefer containers
Reefer containers are essential for transporting goods,
as they have a unit that can maintain the container at temperatures between –30°C and +30°C. The total capacity
of our fleet of reefer containers is around 176,600 TEU.
Two sus­tain­ability-related issues here are energy efficiency
and environmentally friendly cooling agents.
Energy efficiency — 302-3
We have been investing for many years exclusively in units
with a high level of energy efficiency. The units are classified as “efficient” or “inefficient” and have varying degrees
of effectiveness. In order to ensure that classifi­ca­tion is
independent and robust, we also conduct our own tests

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 7

on most of the models in addition to the manufacturer’s
specifications. Here, we test the efficiency of the types
of units used for various container models under specific
stress conditions. This also includes various external and
simulated operating temperatures. Based on this, we can
determine the optimal category of usage for each reefer
container, thereby improving our energy efficiency further.
The average energy consumption per 40-foot reefer container has decreased in the last 15 years from 6.8 kWh/
unit (2002) to 3.6 kWh/unit (2017). In 2016, there was
a slight interruption to this trend, which was due to the
acquisition of CSAV’s fleet of reefer containers. — NfR

Environmentally friendly cooling agent
The strict legislation on preventing greenhouse gases,
including the Montreal Protocol and the EU regulation on
fluorinated greenhouse gases, requires us to take action
in terms of selecting cooling units and the cooling agents
used.
A challenge for us is that a uniform solution has not yet
been found within the industry, and manufacturers are still
pursuing different approaches in the development of environmentally friendly solutions. We are supporting these
measures by testing new technologies and alternative
cooling agents. Since 2010, e. g., we have been testing
containers that use CO2 as a cooling agent.

SOCIAL | CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
As a traditional Hanseatic company, we place a strong emphasis on values. They
define our ethos and are deeply embedded within our corporate culture. For us, there
is no question that we should fulfil our social responsibilities and become involved
in causes beyond our Company’s boundaries – both financially and through our em­
ployees’ active efforts. Our focus here is on those areas which are most familiar to
us: shipping, and all the activities associated with it.

DONATIONS AND SPONSORSHIP

ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION

Our donation and sponsorship activities are centred on
maritime organisations such as seafarers’ missions, the
German Maritime Search and Rescue Association (DGzRS)
and museums and memorials with a maritime dimension.
As such, we primarily support organisations that are
directly or indirectly involved in the well-being of the shipping industry.

Since 2017, we have been engaged in dialogue with
OceanCare, an organisation that works to protect marine
animals and oceans, and WWF Hong Kong, which champions the protection of nature and animal species. As a
result of our discussions with these organisations, we
decided to implement a worldwide ban on the transportation of several controversial goods, including shark fins
and hunting trophies, for ethical reasons. In 2017, we
supported OceanCare with a donation of EUR 50,000.

As a company operating with economic responsibility, our
donation activity is guided by our economic success and
is transparently regulated by a policy that applies to the
entire Company. Among other things, this policy stipulates
that no donations may go to political parties. Furthermore,
the Corporate Communications department must be notified of any financial expenses in advance. In coordination
with the Executive Board, it sets the annual budget at the
start of every year.
In the 2017 reporting year, we spent a total of EUR
412,600 on our CSR activities worldwide. EUR 310,700
of this was for donations and EUR 101,900 was for sponsoring third parties.

Our membership of the World Shipping Council (WSC)
enabled us to relocate the traffic separation scheme off
Sri Lanka’s southern coast in 2017 in order to protect
blue whales on their migration routes. The proposal has
been communicated to the government of Sri Lanka and
is being negotiated by the IMO.
We also champion the interests of society and the environment and conduct frequent discussions with environmental
organisations such as BUND and NABU.

We organise events to raise awareness of the issues and,
with our employees, collect donations to support the fight
against breast cancer. In the immediate aftermath of
Hurricane Harvey, we collected donations and sent them
to the Houston Food Bank. With the help of our employees,

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY | SOCIAL

we also enabled a school in Cali, Colombia, to purchase
new school equipment.
In Mumbai, we organised the Cataract Eye Surgery Camp
for the third time in succession, where 200 eye operations were performed on those in need. Our employees
assisted the patients with transport, and supported them
before and after the operation. In addition, we are also
involved in the prevention of child labour, e. g. by providing around 2,800 meals to schoolchildren so that they
can go to school.
In Dubai, we organised two blood donation initiatives with
the Dubai Health Authority and Latifah Hospital, with over
100 employees taking part.
In the Region Europe, we collected donations for various
institutions such as a hospice in Antwerp, and a school and
an orphanage in Nepal.

ACTION AT HOME
In addition to our global involvement, we want to contribute to local causes. As such, we also participate in nu­merous projects in our home city of Hamburg.
Since 2015, we have been a member of UmweltPartnerschaft Hamburg, an environmental initiative launched in
2003, and have championed efforts to promote voluntary
environmental protection among companies in Hamburg.
We are also active in education in Hamburg. In 2000, we
launched Hamburger Ausbildungs-Netzwerk (HANZ) in

61

partnership with the Otto Group. The goal of HANZ is to
prepare secondary school students for apprenticeships.
Thanks to the support provided by advisory services and
internships, a large number of secondary school students have obtained entry-level qualifications and been
accepted as apprentices at our Company.
We have been working with the Gymnasium Johanneum
in Hamburg and other schools, including some inter­
national schools, for several years now. In 2017, we
worked with these schools to put a number of projects
into action that focused on areas such as internships,
career pres­entations and ship visits. The employees who
took part were relieved from their own work activities for
the duration.
We also contribute to the fields of culture and sport. We
are partners of Filmfest Hamburg, support horse racing
in Hamburg-Horn every year and, since 2017, have been
the main sponsor of the premier league ice hockey
team, the Hamburg Crocodiles. In addition, we organise
events for local clubs and initiatives such as the Rotary
and Lions Clubs. In May of last year, we organised a public
discussion evening with the Mayor of Hamburg, Olaf Scholz,
at our headquarters on Ballindamm as part of “Lange
Nacht der Zeit”.

INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS
As one of the world’s most important container liner shipping companies and Germany’s largest liner shipping
company, we are in continuous communication with politicians at EU, state and municipal level.
At the European Union (EU) level, we are actively involved
in the political decision-making process. To ensure that this
happens in a clear and comprehensible way, we are listed
in the Transparency Register of the European Commission.
Our aim is to participate in the formation of sustainable
environmental legislation and to bring our stringent Groupwide environmental standards into the industry. In doing
so, we also want to ensure that our investment in more
efficient and environmentally friendly ships does not put us
at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we want to
prevent a situation whereby modernisations no longer
meet newer environmental requirements after just a short
period of time. As part of this, we took charge of a work
package from the “Air Emissions from Ships” sub-group

of the European Sus­tainable Shipping Forum within the
Commission in 2017. — 102-13
At state and municipal level, we conduct frequent discussions with the City of Hamburg, the co-owner of our Company. As part of our accountability obligations, we regularly provide the City of Hamburg with information about
the Company’s economic performance and our strategic
objectives. We also communicate our views on infrastructural matters to those involved in policy-making. This
includes the expansion of the port, the fairway adjustment
of the Elbe and the modernisation of rail infrastructure.
We publish a political newsletter three times a year called
“­Hapag-Lloyd Inside”, which is sent to around 3,000 people
in various associations, chambers and the field of politics.
Once a year, we organise a Parliamentary Evening for the
members of the Hamburg parliament as well as the members of the German parliament representing Hamburg, and
we regularly seek to engage in discussions with the political
parties throughout the year. Our Chief Executive Officer,
Rolf Habben Jansen, is also frequently invited as a speaker
to events in the field of politics or those held by politically
active associations.

“We have implemented
stringent environmental
standards across the
Group. Our goal is to
establish them across
the industry through our
involvement in political
discussions.”
Wolfram Guntermann, Director
Environmental Management

REFUGEE COMMITMENT
We have been involved in refugee assistance since 2015.
As part of this, we launched the “­Hapag-Lloyd helps”
project, which is the responsibility of Corporate Communications and is coordinated with the help of three student
employees. Their role is to put employees and refugees in
contact with each other. In 2017, our work focused on an
accommodation facility in Hamburg, where our employees
conducted a range of different activities with the residents. For example, a world café takes place there every
Wednesday. Employees and refugees also cook together
every other week under the guidance of a ­Syrian cook,
and individual mentoring also takes place, with employees
teaching German to refugees and assisting them with
official matters.

As part of our refugee work, we also maintain regular contact with voluntary helpers, the housing and assista­nce
or­ganisation “Fördern und Wohnen” and municipal authorities.

DISASTER AID
When natural disasters occur, it is essential that aid arrives
quickly. In these situations, we help by providing free
transport services so that urgently needed relief can reach
its destination as quickly as possible. Our departments in
the regions affected coordinate our disaster aid efforts
here. Aid shipments of this kind must always be approved
by the ­Hapag-Lloyd Executive Board.
In 2017, we were able to help people in emergency situations by donating food in Venezuela and providing relief to
flood victims in Texas and Peru.

INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S REPORT
INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S REPORT
ON A LIMITED ASSURANCE ENGAGEMENT
ON NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING 1

To Hapag-Lloyd AG, Hamburg
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on
the combined separate non-financial report pursuant to §§
(Articles) 289b Abs. (paragraph) 3 and 315b Abs. 3 HGB
(“Handelsgesetzbuch”: “German Commercial Code”) of
Hapag-Lloyd AG, Hamburg, (hereinafter the “Company”)
for the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017
which comprises the sections marked with the acronym
NfR in the Sustainability Report 2017 of the Company
(hereinafter the “Non-financial Report”).
Responsibilities of the Executive Directors
The executive directors of the Company are responsible
for the preparation of the Non-financial Report in accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289c to
289e HGB.
This responsibility of Company’s executive directors
includes the selection and application of appropriate
methods of non-financial reporting as well as making
assumptions and estimates related to individual non-­
financial disclosures which are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have considered
necessary to enable the preparation of a Non-financial
Report that is free from material misstatement whether
due to fraud or error.
Independence and Quality Control of the Audit Firm
We have complied with the German professional
provisions regarding independence as well as other
ethical requirements.

1	PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH has performed a limited assurance engagement on the German version of the separate non-financial report and issued
an independent assurance report in German language, which is authoritative.
The following text is a translation of the independent assurance report.

H A PA G - L L O Y D A G | S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 7

Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements
and professional standards – in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors and German
Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer
und vereidigte Buchprüfer”: “BS WP/vBP”) as well as the
Standard on Quality Control 1 published by the Institut der
Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany;
IDW): Requirements to quality control for audit firms (IDW
Qualitätssicherungsstandard 1: Anforderungen an die
Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis - IDW
QS 1) – and accordingly maintains a comprehensive
system of quality control including documented policies
and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and
regulatory requirements.
Practitioner´s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance
­conclusion on the Non-financial Report based on the
assurance engagement we have performed.
Within the scope of our engagement we did not perform
an audit on external sources of information or expert
­opinions, referred to in the Non-financial Report.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance
with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements
other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires
that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to
allow us to conclude with limited assurance that nothing
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that
the Company’s Non-financial Report for the period from
1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 has not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with §§ 315b
and 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB.

I N D E P E N D E N T P R A C T I T I O N E R ’ S R E P O R T | I N F O R M AT I O N

In a limited assurance engagement the assurance pro­
cedures are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance
engagement, and therefore a substantially lower level
of assurance is obtained. The assurance procedures
selected depend on the practitioner’s judgment.
Within the scope of our assurance engagement, we
performed amongst others the following assurance pro­
cedures and further activities:
–	Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and of the stakeholder engagement
–	Inquiries of relevant personnel involved in the preparation of the Non-financial Report regarding the preparation process, the internal control system relating to this
process and selected disclosures in the Non-financial
Report
–	Identification of the likely risks of material misstatement
of the Non-financial Report
–	Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures in the
Non-financial Report
–	Comparison of selected disclosures with corresponding
data in the consolidated financial statements and in the
group management report
–	Evaluation of the presentation of the non-financial information

69

Intended Use of the Assurance Report
We issue this report on the basis of the engagement
agreed with the Company. The assurance engagement
has been performed for purposes of the Company and the
report is solely intended to inform the Company about the
results of the limited assurance engagement. The report
is not intended for any third parties to base any (financial) decision thereon. Our responsibility lies only with the
Company. We do not assume any responsibility towards
third parties.

Assurance Conclusion
Based on the assurance procedures performed and
assurance evidence obtained, nothing has come to our
attention that causes us to believe that the Company’s
Non-financial Report for the period from 1 January 2017
to 31 December 2017 has not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in
conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB.
