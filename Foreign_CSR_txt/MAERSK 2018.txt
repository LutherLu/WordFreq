  Foreword by the CEO

  We have begun a journey towards having net-zero CO 2 emissions from our own operations by 2050. This is an important ambition and one we can only deliver on in collaboration with many other stakeholders. ”

  Dear reader, 

  This is A.P. Moller - Maersk’s 10th annual report on our company’s sustainability strategy and performance. During the past decade, A.P. Moller - Maersk has changed in line with our global context. Over the last two years, A.P. Moller - Maersk has moved from being a conglomerate with activities in a broad range of industries, towards becoming one integrated company focusing on end-to-end services in container logistics, simplifying and connecting our customers’ supply chains. 

  In 2018, we reached several key milestones on our strategic journey. In line with our intent to exit the oil and oil-related businesses, in Q1 we closed the sale of Maersk Oil to Total, and in Q3 we announced our intention to pursue a separate listing of Maersk Drilling in 2019. 

  In September, we announced the integration of the commercial organisation of Maersk Line with Damco which is going to market under the Maersk brand as of January 2019. We have successfully progressed on integrating Hamburg Süd, completing the integration of operations and realising synergies above expectations. We have also seen the appointment of a new Executive Board. 

  We have made progress in the move towards digitising our business and the way we serve our customers. Already, we see that 98% of our bookings and 89% of our quotes, respectively, are online. For quotes, this was achieved within just one year and the number is still growing. We continue to develop our blockchain documentation solution, TradeLens, to improve our customer experience and create access to trade, as digitising information can drive down the cost of trade, reduce the occurrence of corruption and support job creation. 

  Zero emissions by 2050 On the global sustainability agenda, the dominant changes over the past ten years have been the establishment of the United Nations Sustainable Development

  Goals and the growing urgency to tackle climate change. With the latest scientific assessments, there is no doubt that the world in general needs to embark on an all-encompassing transformation process away from the reliance on fossil fuels. This goes for shipping as well, and we have taken steps to respond to this need. 

  In 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk established the most ambitious goal for reducing CO2 emissions within our industry. We have begun a journey towards having net-zero CO2 emissions from our own operations by 2050. This is an important ambition and one we can only deliver on in collaboration with many other stakeholders by innovating and developing the technologies needed to reach the target. 

  New approach to safety In 2018 we have also taken significant steps to renew and step up our approach to safety in A.P. Moller - Maersk. While the last decade brought improvements in safety performance, we have reached a plateau at which we have not been able to eliminate the high-potential accidents, including the number of fatalities occurring as part of our operations. In 2018, we experienced seven fatalities, and my Executive Board colleagues and I are deeply distressed by this. 

  We know that accidents are never intentional, they occur as a result of a number of factors coinciding, and there is rarely a correlation between the efforts made to prevent minor events and injuries and high-potential accidents or events. In the future, we will increase our focus on building the organisational capacity and operational controls that will act as barriers to accidents being escalated to life- changing or fatal outcomes. We have established a corporate safety function and new levels of both leadership and employee engagement in safety. I will be at the forefront of these efforts, consistently communicating on the right and obligation to stop unsafe work

  and the importance of being prepared for the unexpected. 

  Global trade will change We publish this report at a time where tensions over global trade are stronger than what we have seen for many years. So far, global trade has not been severely diminished by these tensions, even though we remain alert to different trends in the years to come. Our 100- year history has taught us that trade is nothing if not resilient. When the benefits of global trade are questioned, as they are now, the result is that trade changes. A positive outcome will depend on an orderly process to alter the global rule book on trade. It must reflect the need for greater balance, inclusivity and sustainability in trade, and A.P. Moller - Maersk is putting our leverage and insights to work in that direction. We are committed and taking action to assist more people around the world in trading, through empowering small businesses, by reducing complexities and advocating the reduction of indirect trade costs. 

  Continuously committed In 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk contributed to The Ocean Cleanup project which is addressing the issue of ocean plastic pollution. I am pleased to see our company being part of the efforts to solve this significant issue, and it is clear to me that our small part in this project is a source of pride for many A.P. Moller - Maersk employees. 

  To me, it demonstrates the importance of contributing when and where we can make a difference. We will continue to do so, by running our business with high integrity, supported by our values and policies, and our continued commitment to the UN Global Compact principles. 

  Søren Skou CEO of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S

  OUR COMMITMENTS 

  A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed to operating in congruence with the UN Global Compact’s ten principles on responsible business conduct. 

  We support and commit to contribute positively to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, while also reducing our potential negative impact on the goals. 

  A.P. Moller - Maersk has been recognised as Global Compact LEAD for demonstrating its ongoing commitment to the UN Global Compact and its Ten Principles. In 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk has shown its commitment by participating in Action Platforms on Reporting on the SDGs, Pathways to Low-Carbon & Resilient Development, Decent Work in Global Supply Chains and Sustainable Ocean Business, and has submitted an Advanced Communication on Progress, available at www.unglobalcompact.org/ what-is-gc/participants/44.

  Our sustainability strategy OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY

  The A.P. Moller - Maersk sustainability strategy is designed to support our business strategy and contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We work in partnerships to fulfil our ambitions.

  

  Decarbonise our own operations and decouple growth in business from CO2 emissions

  Invest in innovations and work in partnerships to reduce food loss in the transportation chain

  ver the past two years, 

  A.P. Moller - Maersk has been on a journey of change, reshaping from

  solutions that can alleviate some of the world’s major sustainability challenges while at the same time supporting

  Drive transformation and

  a shipping and energy conglomerate into a focused transport and logistics company. Our ambition is to become the global integrator of container logistics, providing our customers with end-to-end services for a simplified and connected supply chain. 

  Our sustainability strategy was reviewed and updated in 2017 with this ambition in mind. It is made up of four shared value programmes for our integrated container logistics business and is based on responsible business practices on all material issues (see graphic on next page). 

  We see the four shared value areas as the major issues where we can use our business to develop large-scale

  the development of our business. For example, the goal of decarbonising container logistics will support our business in living up to the demands of our customers for low-carbon transportation, as well as meeting the need for cost- efficient energy and helping us prepare for new legislative measures, such as a tax on carbon emissions. At the same time, we will be one of the companies driving progress towards carbon-neutral options in the transportation sector, which is essential for tackling climate change. 

  Fulfilling the new role of business With the launch of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),

  solutions and transformational actions towards 2030. 

  The SDGs also defined a new and enhanced space for business to contribute to solving major global challenges. 

  Looking across the SDGs and underlying targets, the business of A.P. Moller - Maersk touches, directly or indirectly, on all 17 goals. However, for five of the goals we have the ability to contribute to transformations at scale and we can match these goals with our sustainability strategy’s shared value programmes (see graphic below). 

  For example, trade is central to eliminating poverty, creating decent jobs and assisting inclusive industrialisation

  Potential direct / indirect positive impact Where our business has or may potentially have a direct or indirect positive impact through our activities and business practices. 

  Responsibility to mitigate potential negative impact Through our commitment to the UN Global Compact, where our business has a responsibility to mitigate potential negative impacts on people, society and/or the environment. 

  Relevant sub-targets for each Goal are listed under the SDG icons in the report chapters for each material issue.

  and innovation. It is directly and indirectly referenced throughout the sub-targets defined for each SDG. Our business operates at the heart of global trade, and we can leverage our voice and our reach to support action towards achieving these targets – on the ground and in public fora. 

  The SDGs also comprise other areas where we can have a positive impact, but mostly locally or at a smaller scale, and areas where we have a responsibility to mitigate potential negative impact

  from our business. These are areas that are addressed through our corporate programmes on safety, environment, human rights, labour, diversity, responsible tax and anti-corruption etc. 

  The need for partnerships While businesses strive to take on their part in reaching the SDGs before 2030, the need for broader collaboration only increases. A pressing example of this is our ambition to decarbonise container logistics by 2050. This is a huge task

  and we believe we will find better solutions faster by building alliances with competitors, customers, suppliers, knowledge institutions, other industries and the public sector. 

  We will continue in the A.P. Moller - Maersk tradition of working in partnerships to affect systemic change and clear the path for transformation. An overview of some of the partnerships we are involved in can be seen in the sidebar on page six.

  08 STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE INTRODUCTION STRATEGY AND GOVERNANCE TRANSFORMATION AND OUR BUSINESS PROGRESS, ACTIONS AND AMBITIONS PROGRESS OVERVIEW DATA AND ASSURANCE 09

  Governance reflects strategy In 2018, a new governance approach was developed and will continue to evolve, as our business transformation progresses further. The overall governance responsibility for sustainability now resides directly with the Executive Board rather than a separate Sustainability Council, as was the case in the conglomerate structure. The company’s sustainability function brings proposals for new programmes or positions to the Executive Board for approval as and

  when relevant. An annual progress report is compiled for the Executive Board to support oversight on strategic priorities, trends and key issues. The Board of Directors receives sustainability strategy updates, and also reviews and approves the annual Sustainability Report. 

  Each of our sustainability strategy’s four shared value programmes are guided by a task force with executive level sponsorship and management- level representatives from both line of business and sustainability. Each

  task force is chaired and served by the sustainability department helping to drive and facilitate projects and collaborations. 

  Governance on responsible business practices resides with line management which has, in line with our change towards becoming one company, taken on greater responsibility for issues management and risk mitigation.

  MATERIALITY 2018 

  Our materiality model assesses and groups sustainability issues in terms of whether they constitute a risk, responsibility or a shared value opportunity for A.P. Moller - Maersk. Materiality is an important contributor to our strategy development and review processes. Our overall thinking on what materiality means continues to evolve. For example, our work on sustainability risk management and investor engagement, particularly in the context of the recommendations from the Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), (read more on page 15), has prompted us to reconsider some of the strategic and financial risks relative to our material issues. 

  We have not performed a full materiality update in 2018, but have made three changes compared to 2017 in the risk and responsibility categories:

  • The issue of land acquisition and resettlement by linked third parties has become less material following changes in business strategy, resulting in 

  fewer or no green field investments, and has therefore been taken out. • The issue of physical impacts of climate change has been added as an assumed long-term financial risk following the results of research done this 

  year in the area of climate risks. • In a human rights impact assessment we performed internally in 2015, labour rights in indirect hiring and subcontracted workers, transport and other services to/from conflict areas and armed services were identified as lacking in governance and mitigation. We have resolved these management gaps, and are replacing the three issues with the broader issues of human rights and labour rights.

  POLICIES GOVERNING OUR ACTIONS 

  Our work is guided by internal policies based on our Core Values, external standards and commitments. Key international standards and references are listed below.

  and our business The business world is increasingly called upon to use its powers of change and implementation to help solve major societal challenges. A.P. Moller - Maersk focuses on where we have the greatest leverage and potential impact on issues that are material to us.

  Our sustainability strategy calls out four areas where A.P. Moller - Maersk through our business can pursue solutions and call for others to act. These efforts may result in significant system changes and respond to challenges faced by the global society, and at the same time create opportunities for our business. 

  The four areas are climate change, inclusive trade, food loss and ship recycling, and we report on progress and developments in all of these, while also explaining how we understand

  and approach these issues with a view to transformation. 

  The issues of climate change and inclusive trade are given special attention in this year’s report. They are issues that will be fundamentally transformative to how we operate. How they develop will impact business strategy, performance and market conditions globally – for us as well as our supplier and customer base.

  Towards a breakthrough 

  Climate change is one of the world’s most pressing challenges. An effective response will make a difference to how the next decades play out and how the next generations are able to live.

  We knew our 2020 target was a stretched target, and we are convinced that aiming high has pushed us to do more than we would have without setting the bar high. 

  Our efficiency work to date has allowed us to decouple our emissions from trade growth. We are now changing our efficiency target to align both target year and baseline with the IMO strategy for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions in shipping, aiming for a 60%

  IN BRIEF 

  AMBITIONS To help decarbonise logistics through innovation, low-carbon offerings to customers and efficiency measures. Map climate change related risks to A.P. Moller - Maersk assets and supply chain.

  he 2018 report from the 

  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) incontrovertibly states that the effects of climate change cannot fully be prevented, and today the average global rise in temperatures is already 1.0 degree. The report also clearly states that to keep climate change at manageable levels, we need to create a carbon-neutral economy by around 2050.¹ 

  This includes what has been termed ‘hard-to-abate’ sectors, of which shipping is one due to its long asset cycles. A.P. Moller - Maersk is determined to put its resources, relationships and leverage towards abandoning fossil fuels.

  Very ambitious targets In 2018, the Executive Board of A.P. Moller - Maersk approved a new company ambition for climate change: to have net-zero CO2 emissions from our own operations by 2050.² We do not by net-zero refer to off-setting CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. By committing to this target, we believe we will drive the transformation of the shipping industry towards use of carbon-neutral fuels. 

  Based on our experience, we know that efficiency can only keep shipping emissions stable, not reduce or eliminate them. Nevertheless, until decarbonisation is achieved, decoupling

  business growth from emissions is a necessity, and we have set an efficiency target of 60% relative reduction in CO2 by 2030 from a 2008 baseline. 

  With these targets, we are breaking the mould for climate targets and ambitions in the shipping industry. 

  A decade of learning A.P. Moller - Maersk has for ten years pursued ways to reduce our relative CO2 emissions, and had set a target of 60% relative reductions by 2020, using a 2007 baseline. 

  By the end of 2018, our reductions had reached 47% since 2007. This is not enough to reach 60% in two years’ time.

  net-emissions from our own operations by 2050. 

  relative reduction of CO2 emissions by 2030 (2008 baseline). 

  2018 RESULTS

  reduction relative to cargo moved by 2030, compared to a 2008 baseline. This means that we will be able to sustain decoupled CO2 emissions from our growth, and as a company we are proud to already be aligned with the IMO industry target. 

  We have reached that mark by optimising efficiency across our fleet, with technical retrofittings including capacity boost, new bulbous bows, new propellers and engine modifications, and by improving planning and optimising networks. Over the last four years alone, we have invested USD 1 billion and engaged 50+ engineers each year in developing and deploying energy efficiency solutions. We expect this investment level to be sustained in pursuit of our new targets.

  

  TARGETS 2018: 60% relative CO2 reduction by 2020.* Develop low-carbon offerings to customers. 2019: Net-zero CO2 emissions from own operations by 2050. Efficiency target of 60% relative reduction in CO2 by 2030 (2008 baseline). Develop approach to managing risks from physical climate change.

  1 Global Warming of 1.5ºC, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2018. 2 Our target is net-zero CO2 emissions, because using e.g. biofuels will emit CO2 when burned on a vessel. However, if the feedstock used to produce the biofuel absorbs 

  CO2 equal to the emissions produced when burned (and the production process of the fuel is also CO2-neutral) then specific biofuels can be CO2 neutral. 3 The 2050 scenario is based on a simulation, which builds on our expectations for the development of our business activities until 2050 and the reductions coming from exchanging old vessels with zero carbon vessels. It does not however, include post 2030 reductions coming from further reductions on the remaining part of the old fleet.

  relatively cheap, heavy fuel for 100 years is not only about how ships must be designed in the future and what type of engines will power them – safely – on what type of fuel. It is also about building entire new supply chains for these new solutions. All of this breakthrough innovation will have to take place in the 2020s and is more than any single company can do. We are committed to being a leading actor in this process, but we call on everyone to engage and invest in creating the needed innovation. 

  Research and development will be the cornerstone in decarbonising the shipping industry, and we urge all parties

  development, customer engagement, and regulatory advocacy. 

  In addition, we want to begin a dialogue with cargo owners, regulators, researchers, investors and technology developers, and together set the foundation for a sustainable industry.

  Zero emissions vessels on the water by 2030 The pursuit of solutions must begin now. Given the 20-25-year lifetime of a vessel, we must have the first zero- carbon and commercially viable vessel on the seas by 2030. This should be followed by an initial slow ramping up, allowing maturing of technology and supply chain in order to be able to turn

  and test programmes in some of these technologies, for example sustainable biofuels, where we are collaborating with customers and research institutes on development and testing of potential future solutions for low- carbon transportation. Over the coming years, we will expand the range of solutions we are investigating. This will prepare us for selecting a few candidates we will pursue for the first carbon-neutral vessels. 

  Delivering on efficiency We have set a new efficiency target at 60% relative reductions by 2030 with a 2008 baseline and meeting it will require tremendous efforts. We will be working on a portfolio of solutions for reaching this target. Energy efficiency is a discipline where A.P. Moller - Maersk has excelled for decades, yet we still have potential to improve. 

  A major contribution will come from replacing older vessels with new and more efficient ones, taking advantage of our continuous work to optimise hull dimensions, hull shapes, propulsion systems and auxiliary systems, and in recent years we have consistently demonstrated our ability to design and build vessels that perform 15% more efficiently than our average vessels. 

  Another large contribution will come from further optimising our network in terms of both network operations and voyage execution. Over the next few years, we will be able to reap the benefits from our investments in connecting and digitising our vessels.

Currently, 35 of our top 150 customers are using science-based targets and many other customers are working on targets. By reducing emissions in our operations, we can help these customers achieve their CO2 goals and ambitions. A 2018 customer survey showed us that 72% seriously consider sustainability parameters when managing their company’s supply chain, pointing to emissions reductions and low-carbon

  investments. 

  Specifically, we see that the number of customer tender requests including climate and other sustainability-related requirements is increasing approx. 30% year on year. 

  Also, our direct sustainability collaborations or partnerships with 40 key clients over the past five years have evolved from customers making basic demands for CO2 emissions data to more long-term and action-oriented requests for low CO2 solutions along with tangible CO2 reduction pilot projects. We are currently working on offering different

  open and inclusive trade 

  Open trade enables prosperity and growth for people and societies. But these benefits are not accessible to all. A.P. Moller - Maersk wants to be a cornerstone of an inclusive and sustainable global trading system that can help eradicate poverty and deliver decent work for all.

  n 2018, we adopted an ambitious set 

  of commitments to help multiply the benefits of trade (see pages 20–21). We will use our capabilities to reduce complexity in global value chains, so that more countries and more companies can do business simpler, cleaner, faster and cheaper. We will also work to empower small businesses, the ‘conveyer belts’ of innovation and job creation, to have better access to the benefits of trade. 

  Trade is key to progress Looking ahead to 2030, trade will be key to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. On average, 137,000 people have lifted themselves out of poverty every day for the past 25 years.⁷ Many of them through the jobs and benefits generated by trade. Without cross-border trade, the real incomes of the average consumer would be half what they are today and even less for the poorest.⁸ By keeping trade open in the 21st century, extreme poverty may be eradicated for the first time in human history. 

  Meanwhile, headlines on global trade in 2018 have been dominated by escalating trade tensions. By the end of 

  7 Steven Pinker: Enlightenment Now, 2018 8 Quarterly Journal of Economics (2016), 1113–1180

  2018, we have not seen major effects on global trade. But in the coming years, we expect that at their current level, trade tensions may reduce growth in containerised trade by around 0.3% annually. This is potentially significant in a global market growing only 2–4%. 

  Rewriting the rule book on global trade The current trade tensions go to the heart of the multilateral rules- based trading system, and include disagreements over dispute resolution, investment protection and fair, market-based competition. There is an acceptance that the rule book on global trade needs updating in these areas to ensure a level playing field. We are hopeful that WTO member states will agree on reforms to ensure a rules- based global trading system that keeps trade open, market-based and inclusive. 

  Much depends on whether the changes to the trading rules will happen through the current system or whether the system as a whole will move away from multilateral solutions. Nevertheless, the current situation presents a unique opportunity and a pressing need to modernise the trading system to make it fit for the next stage

  of globalisation. The mutual benefits of getting this right are too big to squander and the costs of getting it wrong are unacceptable for present and future generations. 

  Need for inclusive policies Allowing open access to markets for international exporters may have adverse impacts on people if jobs change or disappear. Where these impacts have not been countered by inclusive public policies, support for open trade has been undermined. To retain public support for open trade, it must be combined with inclusive and gender-sensitive policies in areas such as social protection, education, social dialogue and decent work. 

  This smart mix of open trade and inclusive policies in turn requires a rules-based trading system in which countries have room to decide when and how they open up to trade. This involves balancing the potential adverse impacts of open trade on specific groups with the overall benefits for workers, companies and consumers of having access to global markets, lower prices, higher wages and more economic vitality.

  GROWTH AND JOBS Reducing logistics barriers to trade could increase GDP by nearly 

  adding millions of jobs to the global economy.⁹

  

  This balance differs from one country to another and requires a social contract within each. A modern rules-based trading system is one that accommodates the needs of different countries to strike a balance between opening up and leaving no one behind. 

  Trade and sustainable consumption Past industrial revolutions that lifted the majority of mankind out of extreme poverty in just two centuries,¹⁰ were powered by fossil fuels. This is no longer sustainable. An emerging subject in trade debates is sustainable consumption, often defined as consumption patterns where human activities do not impact the natural environment beyond what this can accommodate. 

  The dilemma is that this cannot be at the expense of inclusive growth. Shifting consumption patterns, higher prices, and slower growth will affect some countries and some groups harder than others. If left unaddressed, such negative impacts may threaten the acceptance of policies to address climate change. This may particularly impact countries that already struggle with mass unemployment. 600 million new jobs are needed in developing 

  10 https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty#note-4

  countries alone by 2030 just to keep up with growing populations.¹¹ 

  The debate and ideas for reconciling the diverging dilemmas and trade-offs are hugely important to the world and to our company. For A.P. Moller - Maersk, the business imperative is clear: to be sustainable, the global trade and consumption patterns on which we base our business need to be compatible with nature. Shifts in mindsets and innovative solutions will be necessary to achieve sustainable consumption and growth. We are following the conversations closely and understand that we have to be ready to contribute to the solutions. Our work on climate change is a major part of this, as are the interventions and solutions being developed in our efforts to multiply the benefits of trade (see next pages).

  IN BRIEF 

  AMBITIONS We will use our global reach and position to multiply the benefits of trade by reducing complexity, empowering entrepreneurs and supporting a level playing field for global trade that is open, market-based and inclusive. 

  TARGETS 2018: Invest in digital solutions that facilitate trade. Provide support for implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. 2019: Connect 50% of global containerised trade to digital solutions that reduce supply chain barriers by 2025. Have small and medium-sized customers account for 10% of our total revenue and 30% of our revenue from e-commerce logistics by 2025. Help partners build capacity of 100,000 small and medium-sized enterprises, including women-operated businesses, to engage in cross-border trade by 2025. Contribute to trade facilitation reforms in 30 developing countries by 2025. 

  GOVERNANCE Our commitment to multiplying the benefits of trade is owned by the Executive Board. A task force with key leaders from relevant parts of the business is responsible for setting and achieving the targets.

  Multiplying the benefits of trade – our commitment As a global integrator of container set new, ambitious targets to deliver empowering small businesses to benefit logistics, A.P. Moller - Maersk is on three key priorities for making from trade; and supporting reforms committed to multiplying the benefits global trade more inclusive: reducing to level the playing field for inclusive of trade. To achieve this goal, we have complexity in global value chains; global trade.

  EMPOWER SMALL

  Empowering entrepreneurs through partnerships In 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk became a partner to the SheTrades initiative by the International Trade Centre. The purpose of SheTrades is to enable women entrepreneurs to access the benefits of trade, aiming to connect three million women entrepreneurs to markets by 2021. This is good for inclusion – but it is also just good business. Closing the global economic gender gap could add 26% to annual global GDP by 2025.¹⁶ Together with

  HELP LEVEL THE GLOBAL TRADING FIELD 

  The opportunity: The WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, which came into force last year, is a concrete example of how the world uses the multilateral system to drive progress. Companies in developing countries pay a particularly high price for informal barriers to trade.¹³ Traffic congestion and administrative barriers – popularly known as ‘red tape’ – cause delays that result in additional costs related to storage, inventory, and penalties for exporters and importers. For many, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, these costs can make the difference between trading and not trading. Trade facilitation reform is key to making trade cheaper, faster and more inclusive.

  What we are doing: As a member of the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, A.P. Moller - Maersk provides its expertise in support of trade facilitation projects in developing countries. In 2018, we have contributed to reform projects in India, Sri Lanka, Morocco, Ghana and Kenya. In Ghana, for example – an important hub for regional and

  international business in West Africa – the Alliance works with the government and the private sector to introduce fully automated, paperless customs processing. This will significantly speed up clearance and release of goods thereby contributing to a better business environment.¹⁴

  Third is the potential of exponential technologies to result in ‘winner takes all or most’ outcomes. E-commerce is one example. On the one hand, e-commerce can create access for millions of companies to global markets. On the other hand, critics are pointing out that digital trading platforms can lead to excessive market concentration.

  – a business opportunity Working to reduce food loss will create value for a wide range of stakeholders as well as the A.P. Moller - Maersk business.

  IN BRIEF 

  AMBITIONS To leverage our services, products and capabilities in order to halve food loss in logistics, and simultaneously enhance our cold chain business and support sustainable development. 

  TARGETS

  he issue of food loss and waste 

  is positioned right in the nexus between the growth and sustainability priorities of A.P. Moller - Maersk. We already transport about 27% of the world’s refrigerated containers and 25% of the world’s food commodities, and our business strategy gives priority to the development and growth of our cold chain business. From a sustainability point of view, our large market share and place in the value chain imply opportunities for leverage to reduce food loss, particularly in the stages where most food loss is generated: • the production stage, with 500 million tonnes of food lost every year due to planning and handling 

  issues, followed by • the handling and storage stage, where 350 million tonnes of food is lost every year, due to inadequate storage conditions and time lags in the transportation phase caused by weak organisation of food chains and poor infrastructure.¹⁷ 

  What we can do Our commitment to help halve food loss by 2030 is a new area in our sustainability strategy established in 2017. We are currently shaping our activities and growing our insights and understanding of the issue. For example, how inadequate food storage and transportation conditions create large- scale food loss, particularly in emerging markets, and how partnerships can

  benefit from food loss-reducing solutions. This includes capacity building to reduce post-harvest loss by improving harvesting techniques and handling of products, as well as improving framework conditions for agriculture, infrastructure and trade, which will help governments fulfil national food loss targets. 

  We see a great potential for help tackling the global challenge of food loss in partnership with A.P. Moller - Maersk, due to their expertise in cold chain logistics and wide-reaching network. 

  RAFAEL FLOR Director, Food, The Rockefeller Foundation 

  Furthermore, enhanced capabilities at the production stage, adequate infrastructure and trade conditions as well as temperature-controlled transportation can enable landlocked countries to access ocean shipping with their perishable goods, as they can be transported with freshness intact to trading ports, even if these are located thousands of kilometres away. This

  to establish partnerships to pilot solutions to the food loss occurring in the production, handling and storage stages. 

  In 2018, we mapped relevant organisations for potential partnerships, and we signed a memorandum of understanding with the International Finance Corporation on future cooperation for business-driven food loss projects at country level. We are further pursuing a selected number of global multi-stakeholder partnership opportunities. 

  Together with the Rockefeller Foundation and the agriculture training NGO, Technoserve, we are establishing pilot projects in Kenya and Nigeria, with an aim to expand our activities in the food value chain in East Africa and get closer to the harvest and collection level. 

  Wide-reaching potential benefits With the projected global population growth in the coming decades, the demand for perishable food is projected to increase by 20% annually. It is clear that with the current system's inefficiencies, meeting this demand will put an even more unsustainable pressure on resources such as land and water, and increase CO2 emissions at a time where these need to decrease. One way to address this challenge is to make the system more efficient and sustainable, and we want to contribute to this. If successful, our partnership-

  GETTING INDIAN BANANAS TO EUROPE 

  India is the world’s largest producer of bananas with about 30% share of global production. However, nearly a quarter of production is wasted due to lack of infrastructure and transport capability. Furthermore, India exports less than 1% of its production.

  

  A.P. Moller - Maersk is working on a project together with India’s National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) and farmers in the Theni district in South India. For the first time, the banana trail will be mapped, as the fruit travels through a cold chain.

  

  The goal is to get the export time below 45 days to allow exports to the EU market. This will open a market of at least three million tonnes of banana export, while at the same time preventing the loss of this perishable commodity.

  Progress, actions 

  A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed to ensuring that our business practices are safe, responsible and transparent.

  In this section, we provide a brief and concise overview of progress, actions and ambitions on responsible business practices on 11 issues. We work on these issues by managing risk as well as by living up to the responsibility defined by our Core Values and the principles of the UN Global Compact on human rights, labour rights, environment and anti-corruption. 

  The issue of personal safety for our employees merits particular attention because our approach to safety has undergone a thorough review and renewal in 2018.

  

  On all other responsibility and risk issues in this section, we report across selected key categories of disclosure including ambitions; why the issue is important and how it is material; targets for 2018 (as reported in our 2017 Sustainability Report); targets for 2019 or ahead, if revised; progress for this year; and governance. We also connect our work with the relevant UN SDG targets and indicators.

  A fundamental shift Focusing on leadership, organisational capacity, operational controls and employee engagement will propel us forward in the next phase of employee safety.

  Building capacity for safety Through consultation with global safety experts and best practice organisations within safety, we learned that a focus on zero accidents alone is not a sufficient motivator. A far better motivator and guide post is the core belief that safety is not the absence of accidents, but the presence of capacity and effective controls to eliminate as many of the factors contributing to the occurrence of accidents and managing the outcome of an accident. We have previously targeted zero

  Accidents should never be allowed to have a fatal or permanent injury as an outcome for anyone working for A.P. Moller - Maersk. We need to create a working environment and a culture enabling

  t the beginning of 2018, the 

  A.P. Moller - Maersk Executive Board decided to conduct a thorough review of the company’s safety performance, as no significant improvements had been achieved during the past 4–5 years. 

  The review showed that we had reached a plateau in safety performance, with the frequency of incidents not improving. More importantly, high- consequence events, particularly those resulting in fatalities, continued to occur. In the past five years alone, 34 colleagues have lost their lives while working for A.P. Moller - Maersk. 

  The loss of five colleagues due to a fire on the Maersk Honam in March

  

  The conclusions and recommendations were approved by the Executive Board and the Board of Directors in the autumn of 2018, leading to a significant change in our approach going forward, rebooting our safety efforts to ensure safety is embedded in all aspects of the organisation, and involving every part of the business, every employee and all business processes. 

  Three main elements Moving forward, addressing three priorities becomes critical: • Leadership accountability – all leaders must be fully and emotionally 

  engaged in and committed to safety; • Capacity for safe operations – stronger

  operational controls in place and with high levels of employee engagement. 

  Clear authority, roles, tasks, and objectives for safety at all levels in the company are and will remain important parts of the safety transformation journey. 

  Impacts of change come later The new safety approach will be rolled out from leadership level, starting January 2019. To guide the process of change, a new corporate safety function was established in late 2018, to formulate the overall safety strategy and to facilitate best practice sharing and governance across the company.

  The safety of our employees is our responsibility and focus, and the loss of seven colleagues in 2018 alone, clearly underlines the need for change in our safety approach to make sure all employees can go to work not only feeling safe, but being safe.

  accidents. Going forward, the target we communicate and use as motivator is to make A.P. Moller - Maersk a safe place to work. We will encourage the elimination of the risk of accidents through designing a safe work place where as many risk factors as possible are controlled, and focusing not on who failed, but on what failed. 

  We will set this course to ensure that if and when we do have accidents, the organisation is able to ‘fail safely’ so that high-potential events do not result in permanent and life-changing injuries or fatalities. 

  A real-life example of this approach is the safety features in ordinary cars. Our new approach is similar to the existence of seat belts, air bags,

  TARGETS 

  2018 and 2019: Ensure compliance with the A.P. Moller - Maersk governance document on Global Employee Relations, which is based on internationally recognised labour standards. 

  WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? 

  A positive relationship with our employees and nurturing diversity is fundamental to our success as a business. This begins with ensuring respect for internationally recognised human rights and labour standards in all our workplaces. 

  PROGRESS IN 2018 

  As due diligence, we carried out a company-wide self-assessment of the compliance with our Rule on Global Employee Relations in 180 entities worldwide. Based on the assessment, we have initiated improvement actions in the following areas:

  In a few countries, where inflation and costs of living are rising rapidly, salaries may not enable employees to 

  meet basic needs. • Equal treatment: Reports of employment decisions influenced by factors such as gender, ethnicity, nationality, religion or sexual orientation were dealt with through 

  internal grievance systems. • Freedom of association: We are present in countries where independent trade unions are prohibited by law. We seek to honour our principles for employee relations while also complying with the law. We have taken steps to increase consistency in the way this is 

  managed locally. • Forced labour: We operate in countries where local laws and practices may require employees to obtain approval from their current employer before changing jobs. There are also cases where employees are granted loans by the company. We have taken further steps to reduce the risk of bonded labour.

  e-learning programme on Global Employee Relations, which is mandatory for all employees and covers the international labour standards that are most salient to our business. Alongside this, we continued specialised training for employees working with manning agencies, with a focus on our inland service operations. 

  Our whistleblower system received 31 HR-related cases, including cases related to potential infringements of our principles on Global Employee Relations. These are investigated and dealt with according to the procedure in the whistleblower system. 

  GOVERNANCE 

  Employee relations at A.P. Moller - Maersk are governed according to our policy on Global Employee Relations based on international labour standards. The Global Employee Relations Council, reporting to the Chief Human Resources Officer, oversees compliance.

  diversity at our senior levels. 

  TARGETS 

  2018 and 2019: • Target for representation of women on the Board of Directors (see graphic 

  below). • Target for representation of women and persons from countries that are not in the OECD high-income countries list (see graphic below). 

  WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? 

  It is a basic obligation and a core element of our values not to discriminate against our employees. Discrimination bars people from living up to their full potential, creates inequality as well as less stable and prosperous societies. We also want to leverage the competitive advantage that diverse teams and inclusive cultures can bring to our business.

  

  The current targets are not seen as end points, but as steps along the way. We aim to create more micro targets for specific parts of the employee life cycle. These include gender recruitment targets, balanced with always hiring the best person for the job, and a target maternity return rate of 90% (currently at 73%). Since 2016, we have offered a global minimum of 18 weeks’ maternity leave on full pay for all employees, and the option to work 20% less hours at full pay for up to six months within the first year of childbirth or adoption. 

  1. Inclusive leadership capabilities • Continued roll-out of workshops focusing on understanding and mitigating unconscious bias across 

  leadership levels. • Developed and prepared 2019 launch of a new e-learning programme for 

  all employees. • Delivered unconscious bias training during key restructuring projects embedding diversity when making people decisions.

  • Signed up to the UN LGBTI Standards for Business as part of our existing commitment to human rights and established a website with guidance 

  and tools for line management. • Celebrated International People with Disabilities day, our first step in engaging employees globally on 

  disability inclusion. • Local and regional initiatives rolled 

  out by employee networks. • Close to 300 women across the company engaged through our women’s development programme, which also provides virtual learning for its 1000 alumni. 

  GOVERNANCE 

  Our Diversity and Inclusion programme is managed through the human resources department. Standards for non-discrimination of employees are part of the Global Employee Relations governance document.

  Disaster response Ocean health

  AMBITIONS 

  To act in accordance with our values by using our leverage and logistics capabilities to support response efforts to large natural disasters and in complex emergencies. 

  TARGETS 

  2018 and 2019: • Participate, as part of the Logistics Emergency Team (LET), in filling operational gaps in case of complex emergencies and large-scale natural 

  disasters. • Contribute in LET preparedness activities such as training and knowledge sharing on transport and logistics capacity as well as site access at selected locations. 

  WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? 

  When natural or human-incurred disaster strikes, emergency logistics

  services are a key factor. Having aid reach the impacted areas more quickly and efficiently saves lives. Our deep knowledge of logistics and global presence allows us to deliver on this need, and we see it as a clear responsibility to do so. 

  PROGRESS IN 2018 

  Our disaster response efforts are mainly carried out through the Logistics Emergency Team (LET) which comprises four global logistics and transportation companies: UPS, A.P. Moller - Maersk, Agility and DP World. The LET supports the Global Logistics Cluster, led by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), which provides emergency responses to complex humanitarian crises and natural disasters. In 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk: • Increased our allocation of time and resources to also respond to human- incurred disasters in addition to natural disasters.

  • Contributed to the response plan following the earthquake in Indonesia in September, with information on the country’s infrastructure and ocean freight options, and reserving containers to support disaster relief 

  if needed. • After a cholera outbreak in Yemen in 2017, we collaborated with LET partners in donating four refrigerated 

  containers to store medical supplies. • Continued to map freight and logistics options to secure the Global Logistics Cluster’s preparedness in risk-prone areas. 

  GOVERNANCE 

  The Executive Board decides on activation of support to large-scale natural disasters upon request from the Global Logistics Cluster. A dedicated contact point coordinates requests from the LET to A.P. Moller - Maersk representatives in relevant locations.

  AMBITIONS 

  As a citizen of the oceans, we will contribute to protecting the health of oceans, and continuously reduce our own impacts. 

  TARGETS 

  2018: • Mature the partnership with the World Ocean Council and the science 

  community. • Explore partnership opportunities in 

  the marine plastic litter community. • All vessels are compliant with the IMO Ballast Water Management Convention. 

  2019: • All vessels are compliant with the IMO Ballast Water Management 

  Convention. • Continue collaboration with the 

  Ocean Cleanup Project. • Support ocean science research through data collection and partnerships.

  WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? 

  Ocean health is pivotal to the health of nature and people. Higher sea temperatures and the proliferation of plastic waste indicate that ocean health is under threat. We are obligated to act, as emissions from our activities contribute to acidification and rising temperatures, and as a citizen of the oceans to contribute to finding solutions. 

  PROGRESS IN 2018 

  • We registered one case of reported non-compliance with ballast water regulation in Montreal, Canada. The case was related to reporting errors 

  and we received a fine of USD 9,100. • Established collaboration with the Ocean Cleanup project, contributing around USD 2.0 million in vessel services and equipment for the installation of the first full-scale ocean plastic clean-up system, as well as providing open-top containers for the collected plastic.

  • Collaborated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), under the U.S. Department of Commerce, to deploy 16 drifter buoys which as part of NOAA’s network of around 1,000 buoys collect data for marine and climate sciences. During 2019, we will continue to work with NOAA in collaboration with the World Ocean Council’s ‘Smart Oceans – SMART Industries’ initiative to develop a programme to improve data 

  collection from selected areas. • Joined and launched the UN Global Compact Sustainable Ocean Business Action Platform, a three-year project. 

  GOVERNANCE 

  Our ocean health activities are governed through the rules and guidance on HSE management in the central A.P. Moller - Maersk governance system. Our collaboration with the Ocean Cleanup Project is under the sponsorship of the Executive Board.

  TARGETS 

  2018 and 2019: • Ensure full compliance with tax regulations in all countries where we 

  operate. • Continue to engage in dialogue with 

  stakeholders on tax matters. • Implement the B Team Responsible Tax Principles by 2020 (The B Team is a non-profit initiative aiming to catalyse more sustainable business practices). 

  WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? 

  Well-functioning tax systems locally and

  internationally help finance education, infrastructure and other public services that support sustainable development, local societies, business and trade. We recognise the need for companies to support the local economies in which they do business. 

  PROGRESS IN 2018 

  • Total tax charge in 2018 was 

  USD 645 million. • Participated in The Tax Dialogues organised by Oxfam IBIS, the B Team’s responsible tax project, the ICC international Chamber of Commerce Taxation Commission, and the UN 

  Committee of Tax Experts. • As a founding signatory of the B Team Responsible Tax Principles, we performed an internal assessment against the principles. As an outcome

  of this assessment, we began collection of information regarding tax incentives throughout the world, and development of procedures for reporting of taxes paid at country level. 

  We operate globally, including in some countries that are listed as non- cooperative by the EU or other tax authorities. We do not engage in tax avoidance activities. Out of the five countries on the EU list for 2018, we have a Maersk Line Agency and a shore branch for a drill ship in Trinidad & Tobago. 

  GOVERNANCE 

  Our approach to tax is directed by the A.P. Moller - Maersk Tax Principles and governed in line with the rules and guidance stated in the central A.P. Moller - Maersk governance system.

  estimated to litter all the major ocean basins. The source of this problem is primarily insufficient waste management on land, rivers and sea. Therefore, making the oceans healthy will require a multi-layer solution with a multitude of innovation and change. 

  As responsible citizens of the ocean, we want to contribute to alleviating the problem by assisting in removing the plastic which is already in the oceans. The Ocean Cleanup Project, a non-profit organisation, has developed a 600 m-long floating buoy system with a screen to collect plastic debris for recycling. 

  The first offshore cleaning system was towed and installed by a Maersk Supply Service vessel in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, located 1,200 nautical miles off the coast of San Francisco. The patch contains an estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic and covers an area twice the size of Texas. After installation, our vessels are further monitoring progress and operations.

  

  At the end of 2018, the installment malfunctioned and was towed back to shore with terabytes of data ready to be used to develop necessary upgrades. Our vessel also carried around 2,000 kg of plastic that had been recovered from the patch.

  

  The Ocean Cleanup Project’s long-term ambition is to install at least 60 systems to remove 50% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch within five years.

  42 DATA AND ASSURANCE | ASSURANCE 43

  Independent assurance report Stay up-to-date

  To the Stakeholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S A. P. Møller - Mærsk A/S engaged us to provide limited assurance on the data and information described below and set out in the Sustainability Report of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S for the year ended 31 December 2018. 

  Our conclusion Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to believe that data and information in the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 are without any material misstatements and have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting policies as stated on https://www.maersk.com/about/sustainability/reports. 

  This conclusion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of our report. 

  What we are assuring The scope of our work was limited to assurance over data and information in the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report for the year ended 31 December 2018. 

  Professional standards applied and level of assurance We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) ‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information’. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance

  Understanding reporting and measurement methodologies Data and information need to be read and understood together with the accounting principles https://www.maersk.com/about/sustainability/reports, which Management are solely responsible for selecting and applying. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time. 

  Work performed We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the data and information. In doing so and based on our professional judgement, we: • Conducted interviews with management at corporate and Brand level 

  responsible for the sustainability strategy, management and reporting; • Performed an assessment of materiality and the selection of topics for the 2018 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report and comparison to the 

  results of a media search; • Read and evaluated reporting guidelines and internal control procedures at corporate level and in two major Brands regarding the data to be 

  consolidated in the 2018 Sustainability Report; • Conducted analytical review of the data and trend explanations submitted by all Brands and Business Units to A.P. Moller - Maersk Accounting & 

  Controlling for consolidation; • Evaluated internal and external documentation to determine whether information in the 2018 Sustainability Report is supported by sufficient evidence.
