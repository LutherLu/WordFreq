  INTRODUCTION

  The CMA CGM Group, founded by Jacques R. Saadé, is a global leader in maritime transport and logistics. For over 40 years, the Group’s strong human and entrepreneurial values of boldness, initiative, integrity and imagination have shaped its growth. Currently headed by Rodolphe Saadé, CMA CGM has steadily grown and is constantly innovating to offer customers increasingly efficient and sustainable services. CMA CGM boasts a fleet of over 500 vessels, operating between 400 ports and with 750 warehouses worldwide. In 2019, it transported more than 20 million containers. 

  Our leading position stems from the service quality we deliver to customers daily . 

  In 2019, we amplified service digitalisation to offer new innovative services tailored to customer requirements. The Group’s business has diversified to encompass land transport and logistics. In 2019, two-thirds of container land transport was via train or barge. The acquisition of CEVA Logistics has consolidated our position as an integrated operator offering increasing door-to-door solutions for our customers.

  The CMA CGM Group is firmly committed to the energy transition and to becoming a leader in low carbon transport and logistics. Improving our environmental footprint and that of our customers is at the heart of our strategy. We have opted for liquefied natural gas (LNG) to power our new vessels, aiming beyond regulatory requirements on atmospheric pollution and significantly reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. We were the first to successfully test second-generation biofuels produced from waste cooking oil, which emit 85% less carbon dioxide than traditional fuel. We will be pioneers in developing this offer on an industrial scale for our customers. These innovations reflect our philosophy: act now using the best technical solutions available, and actively prepare for the future.

  Rodolphe Saadé Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of the CMA CGM Group

  CMA CGM GROUP CSR APPROACH 

  United Nations Global Compact Sustainable Development Goals – the Group’s CSR approach

  Environment Social

  Performance 

  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 18

  


**************************** Page 19****************************

  The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a blueprint for action for businesses which, like CMA CGM, strive to act responsibly and control the impact of their activity on the economy, the environment, people and society. 

  The 17 universal goals include respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, reduction of inequalities and protection of the environment. 

  In 2018, CMA CGM established a CSR approach in line with the 17 SDGs to assess its position in relation to the UN programme. The results of this assessment are presented in the introduction of each part of this document.

  At the UN Climate Change Conference COP 25, CMA CGM joined the Global Compact, the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative bringing together more than 13,000 participants across 170 countries. The aim of the Global Compact is to mobilise companies and other stakeholders to take concrete measures towards achieving sustainable development goals. 

  The Global Compact provides a simple, voluntary system for participants to commit to ten principles on human rights, international labour standards, the environment and the combat against corruption. 

  The Group has also joined the Sustainable Ocean Business Action Platform, which promotes sustainable ocean development goals and is signatory of the nine Sustainable Ocean Principles on protecting and restoring the health of the ocean.

  In 2019, once the CSR risks had been assessed and compared with the CSR challenges, the priority SDGs for the Group were identified.

  While its business does not directly contribute to achieving these goals, CMA CGM actively promotes them.

  CMA CGM’s business activities actively and positively contribute to achieving these

  Given its business activities, these goals are strategic for CMA CGM.

**************************** Page 22****************************

  The Group’s CSR risk map With support from the Risk Management department, a CSR risk map was created in line with the materiality matrix. Work in 2019 involved:  First, identifying existing risk maps associated with each of the 12 CSR challenges and positioning each of 

  these risks in a “CSR” risk map  Second, comparing the challenges of the materiality matrix with the risks of the CSR risk map. This enabled us to determine: - Challenges with no associated risks. Analyses of 

  missing risks are currently being conducted; - Whether the position of each risk was similar to or differed from the challenges. Any differences were identified and explained.

  To date, the following CSR-related risks have been identified:  Risk of non-compliance with “ethics and compliance” regulations, particularly regarding: competition, corruption, economic sanctions and personal data 

  protection  Partnerships with our suppliers and subcontractors  Human rights  Working conditions  Health & safety  Security  Climate change  Scarcity of raw materials and waste production  Pollution  Harm to biodiversity

  Managing risk and mapping Group risk 

  Risk management is handled by the Corporate Risk Management and Internal Audit Department. The Risk Management team implements a corporate-level approach under the impetus of the Executive Board, with input from the various business lines. The methodology is based on a qualitative assessment at a point in time projected over a year. The Group risk map and risk maps per business line/function are based on two criteria: ● Probability of occurrence ● Severity of impact

  Steering CSR performance 

  The Sustainability Department reports to the Executive Board and is tasked with: ● Implementing CSR policy in line with all of the 

  Group’s policies ● Identifying stakeholders’ CSR issues, priorities 

  and requirements ● Setting CSR goals and coordinating action plans ● Assessing, measuring and reporting on CSR performance 

  At the end of 2019, a Sustainability Committee was created under the impetus of the Executive Board. It regularly convenes members of the Executive Committee to define, adjust and validate progress on the Group’s CSR roadmap. The Sustainability Committee, launched in January 2020, also aims to enhance the Group’s overall strategy as well as broaden and implement customer offers. 

  In addition, an Operational CSR Committee convenes quarterly to roll out the strategic pillars decided by the Executive Board and Sustainability Committee and implement adequate measures. The committee comprises members from various departments (Human

  Resources, Risk Management and Internal Audit, Compliance, Finance, Communication and Marketing, Purchasing, Transformation and Innovation, Security, Safety and the Environment), the network of agencies, the Lines, CMA Ships, the CMA CGM Foundation and the Group’s subsidiaries. 

  Ad hoc “business line” or “project” committee meetings are held in parallel along with more operational working groups that meet more frequently. 

  An expanding network of CSR correspondents has also been established, comprising CSR contributors working in support services and the subsidiaries. They are ambassadors of the Group’s CSR approach, advocating and coordinating initiatives and projects. 

  A CSR dashboard has been set up to measure and steer the Group’s sustainable development performance through a series of quantitative and qualitative indicators that are consolidated on a half-yearly basis. – cf. page 150: Key Performance Indicators Data completeness and reliability, enhanced from year to year, are guaranteed by indicator fact sheets describing the collection and consolidation scope and processes.

**************************** Page 31****************************

  Employee training Training for new hires New employees at the head office in Marseilles are invited to attend a two-day induction programme. On the first day, they learn about the history of the CMA CGM Group, its strategy and values. The values of the CMA CGM Group are reflected in its CSR strategy, and are presented by various Group representatives (CSR, Environment, Sustainable Procurement, Ethics and Compliance, Security and the CMA CGM Foundation) over the two days. The second day deals with business lines at CMA CGM and related tools (containers, vessels, terminals), life at sea, the Captain’s role, and the organisation of lines, and the CMA CGM Group in general. The purpose of the induction programme is to enable each new head office employee to gain an understanding of the Group as a whole, as well as its various business lines and facets. New employees are taught to see their own role in the wider picture and the impact each person has on the overall success and sustainability of the CMA CGM Group. In 2019, 322 employees attended integration sessions.

  Training on the environment CMA CGM invests in training courses designed to make environmental protection an integral part of all business activities. Upon joining the Group, all new employees receive safety and environment training for their job so that they can do their work in full compliance with applicable rules. Depending on their job, employees then attend specific training modules for their field (for example, ISO 14001 training for 25 internal auditors this year, but also courses on chemical risks for employees handling chemical products). Moreover, an environment-related e-learning programme is prepared for all seafarers, depending on their rank and potential impact on the environment. The modules may be followed on board or on land. Special seminars for officers are also routinely organised at the Group’s head office to inform, raise awareness and train them on issues relating to health, safety, security and the environment. The seminars are held twice a year at head office. The CMA CGM Academy portal features an e-learning module accessible to all employees that lists the key points of the Group’s environmental policy to be presented to customers. This training module lasts 30 minutes. It has already been followed by over 4,500 employees.

  PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT 2019 Accomplishments 

  Face In the face of global environmental challenges, the CMA CGM Group is firmly committed to the green transition. We have taken pioneering concrete decisions to reduce the impact of our activities on the climate, air quality and biodiversity. Our philosophy regarding the environment is reflected in our decisions, such as avoiding Arctic shipping routes, investing massively in liquefied natural gas to fuel our new vessels and testing and using second-generation biofuels from 2020. We are striving to take concrete steps today, activating all levers at our disposal and looking beyond foreseeable technological progress. This philosophy is embodied in our motto: PROUD TO ACT. 

   As a corollary to its participation in the United Nations Global Compact (-UNGC) , the Group has joined the Sustainable Ocean Business Action Platform. The multi-stakeholder platform promotes sustainable ocean development goals and best practices. 

  Energy transition Improved the energy performance of the Group’s fleet: 24% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions since 2015, ahead of our voluntary target of 30% by 2025  Second-generation biofuel testing on two Group vessels in partnership with IKEA  ETA 2020: implementation of the Group’s global sulphur cap strategy through three main solutions: liquefied natural 

  gas, low sulphur fuels, and flue gas treatment systems.  Launch of an international Coalition for the energy transition at the French Summit on Maritime Economics Assises de l’Economie de la Mer 

  Biodiversity protection Three vessels dismantled and 10 cubic metres of solid waste generated per vessel per month The Group has agreed not to use the Northern Sea Route

  General Policy Environmental protection is a central to CMA CGM’s commitment to sustainable, responsible development. Overarching issues for the Group include continuing to shrink the environmental footprint of all maritime and inland operations; regulatory compliance and planning ahead for future regulations; and developing more eco- efficient logistics chains with customers and partners.

  The CMA CGM Group’s environmental policy is built on three strategic concerns: ● Climate change: improving the carbon footprint of 

  Group activities ● Air quality: reducing atmospheric pollution ● Ecosystems: protecting the oceans and marine biodiversity

  Launch of the CMA CGM Jacques Saadé

  A world first: the largest LNG-powered container ship in the history of maritime transport was launched in Shanghai on 25 September 2019. Bearing the name of the Group’s founder, the CMA CGM Jacques Saadé is entirely powered by liquefied natural gas and has a capacity of 23,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent unit). This feat of engineering illustrates CMA CGM’s commitment to the energy transition.

  Alternative fuel – Biofuel 

  CMA CGM is adopting marine biofuels at an increasing rate. CMA CGM chose Shell as its supplier of several thousand tonnes of second-generation biofuel derived from used cooking oil. CMA CGM Group vessels will be able to sail approximately one million kilometres with biofuels. With this choice, the Group reaffirms its role as a pioneer in the use of sustainable, eco-friendly solutions for the energy transition in the shipping and logistics industry. 

  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 40

  


**************************** Page 41****************************

  CMA CGM chooses LNG

  In 2017, Rodolphe Saadé, Chief Executive Officer of the CMA CGM Group, announced that nine vessels with a 23,000 TEUs capacity (twenty-foot equivalent unit) had been ordered, with the decision taken to equip them with LNG motors. These are not only the Group’s largest vessels, but also the first LNG-powered vessels of this size in the world. With these vessels, CMA CGM is taking action above and beyond environmental regulations. By 2022, CMA CGM will have the largest fleet of LNG container ships: 

  9 23,000 TEU vessels, 5 15,000 TEU vessels, 6 1,400 TEU vessels, including 3 that are already in operation at Containerships, the Group’s intra-European subsidiary. With these vessels, CMA CGM is taking action above and beyond environmental regulations. The IMO’s new Low Sulphur regulation aims to divide bunker fuel sulphur levels by seven. This will reduce sulphur oxide emissions by 85% around the world. CMA CGM will already fully comply with the new regulation in 2020, even surpassing it by investing in LNG technology. Liquefied natural gas cuts sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions by 99%. It also cuts fine particulates by 99% and nitrogen emissions by 85%. The result is a remarkable improvement in air quality, particularly for coastal communities and port cities. 

  CMA CGM decides not to use the Northern Sea Route 

  A forward-thinking choice for biodiversity protection in the Arctic and more generally planet-wide. The Northern Sea Route, a channel between Asia and Europe that follows the polar coasts of Russia, has become navigable due to glacial melting from global warming. Teeming with unique biodiversity that is only partially understood, the Arctic plays a crucial role in regulating currents and the global climate. Massive use of the sea route would pose real danger to the outstanding natural ecosystems of this part of the globe due to the risk of accidents, oil pollution, and ship strikes to dolphins and whales. To avoid endangering this fragile environment even further, Rodolphe Saadé has decided that none of CMA CGM Group’s 500 vessels will take the Northern Sea Route. 

  With this decision, CMA CGM takes a definite stand to protect the environment and global biodiversity despite the competitive advantage that this route would represent for maritime companies.

  1. Energy transition Energy consumption has always been a core concern give the very nature of the Group’s business. The fight against climate change leads to greater technical, regulatory, financial and operating constraints, with significant impact on activities that still rely heavily on fossil fuels. This backdrop also creates new opportunities for sustainable, fair shipping. The CMA CGM Group is striving to become a leader on these new markets. The transition to more efficient, carbon-free energy solutions is of interest to the economy, the environment and public health. On a day-to-day basis, it involves several Group entities. 

  Energy consumption 

  Indicators 2018 2019 Change Fuel consumption of the maritime fleet 4 8,259 7,782 -6% In thousands of tonnes

  ● In 2018, the Group introduced a programme to install recovery boilers for auxiliary engines (as for the main engine). Instead of burning oil to produce the necessary steam, the boilers recover heat from the auxiliary engine exhaust gases, even when the main engine is shut down. This technology has been installed on 21 vessels. 

  Fleet Navigation Centers anticipate extreme weather events and advise captains in choosing a route to minimise fuel consumption of our vessels. Three Fleet Navigation Centres covering all time zones are manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week by seagoing personnel assigned to the shore-based facilities. Moreover, a Group operations department has been set up to optimise all Group operations (maritime and operational management of ships, reduce port congestion, optimal use of the CMA CGM sea and land network).

  Fuel/loaded TEU 5 kg/TEU

  399 361 -9%

  Combatting climate change

  In 2019, fuel consumption for the CMA CGM Group’s maritime activity was 7,782 thousand tonnes, i.e. 6% lower than in 2018. With regard to energy efficiency, we reported a net improvement in the amount of fuel per loaded container, which was 9% lower than in 2018. 

  For many years now, the Group has conducted several initiatives to reduce fuel consumption. These include replacing the fleet, monitoring consumption, reducing speed, optimising routes and improving propulsion and hydrodynamic technology. 

  ● In 2013 CMA CGM launched a programme to optimise its owned fleet primarily by modifying its bulbous bows. These changes were done in dry dock and help to maximise the ship’s hydrodynamics at the speeds used in our company. Some 64 ships have been modified, in addition to new builds. This innovation can cut fuel use and carbon dioxide emissions by 5-10%. Additionally, there is a programme to switch out old propellers for energy-efficient ones. In 2019, 

  20 propellers were changed. ● Another example of efforts to reduce energy consumption is CMA SHIPS’ limiting the capacities of the main engines of its largest vessels to adapt to current navigation speeds. 

  4 Total maritime scope – Owned and chartered fleet – Annual consumption 2018 & 2019

  

  a. Managing greenhouse gas emissions According to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), carbon dioxide emissions from shipping account for 2.2% of total global emissions. During the 72nd Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) held in April 2018, the IMO entered into an agreement for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions associated with the shipping industry, thereby getting the industry on board in the fight against climate change. The agreement set a goal of halving carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 compared to 2008 levels and cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 40% per container by 2030 and 70% by 2050. It also sets forth more stringent standards for new ships. With these challenges in mind, the CMA CGM Group has set an ambitious new goal of 30% less carbon dioxide per loaded container by 2025. This is after already improving its carbon emissions per container and per kilometre by 50% between 2005 and 2015. The Group has already reduced its carbon emissions per loaded container by 24% since 2015. 

  In 2015 the European Parliament passed the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) regulation that requires companies to report carbon dioxide emissions of vessels sailing out of, towards and within the European Union.

  Reporting started in 2018, and each carrier has submitted the report of its carbon dioxide emissions to the European Union. The Group has developed a reporting tool to ensure compliance, along with the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS). The first year of reporting went smoothly, and the data filed complied with requirements.

  Alongside the European system, the IMO’s international reporting system for carbon dioxide emissions, known as the IMO DCS (Data Collection System), took effect in January 2019. The Group has developed a tool specifically for the IMO DCS, complementing the MRV tool.

  b. Overall assessment of the Group’s 

  carbon dioxide emissions For the CMA CGM Group, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions is the combustion of fuel, which represents more than 83% of the Group’s total energy use. The energy consumption of shore activities (mainly electricity at the agencies and terminals) is insignificant in comparison with the consumption of the shipping fleet. The main indirect sources of carbon dioxide emissions for the Group are shipbuilding and fuel use in ships. In 2019, scope 3 represented approximately 16.5% of the Group’s carbon dioxide emissions. 

  ● Scope 1 includes emissions from the consumption of fuel by the owned and chartered vessels as well as the fuel consumed at the terminals by materials handling 

  machinery ● Scope 2 includes emissions from the consumption of electricity at the terminals, regional offices and head 

  office, and shore-to-ship power ● Scope 3 emissions stem from ship- and container- building, on-board waste (solid and liquid), employee business travel, the consumption of fuel oil specific to inland transport, and upstream bunker fuel production and transport

  Through the Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG), a discussion and collaboration platform, maritime shippers and major shipping customers are helping develop 

  methods to calculate air emissions in their industry. The working group represents no less than 80% of container shipping capacity. CMA CGM has been an active member since 2003. 

  Based on CCWG methodology, and to meet regulatory requirements and customer requirements, in 2008, CMA CGM set up a monitoring system for its carbon dioxide emissions and performance (in g/TEU-km) which is audited by an independent accredited organisation. The CMA CGM Group (through its subsidiary APL) is a member of the CCWG executive committee.

  The IMO’s decisions to limit the sulphur content of ship fuel as of 1 January 2020 to 0.5%, and the ambitious strategy recently adopted to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, have focused the industry’s attention on finding alternative solutions to conventional fuel. 

  In light of these challenges, energy transition is a major issue for the shipping industry as a whole and the CMA CGM Group in particular. The main challenges associated with alternative fuels lie in the compatibility of their environmental benefits as regards pollution, availability of the quantities required by the industry, and cost. 

  The most promising solutions are LNG, biofuels and hydrogen . Fuel cells, batteries and wind power have their advantages, but must be considered as secondary or back-up sources. 

  The liquefied natural gas The Group has made LNG its fuel of choice. LNG has many environmental advantages compared with heavy fuel oil,

  

  In November, the CMA CGM Group received the prize for the “Most accomplished Asia Pacific Ship Owner of the Year” at the Maritime 2020 conference in Singapore. The prize is bestowed upon the ship owner that has demonstrated the most efforts in making its fleet more sustainable, efficient and environmentally-friendly.

  such as significantly lower carbon dioxide emissions, the absence of sulphur oxide (SOx) and the drastic reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) and fine particulates. As a true technological breakthrough in environmental protection, compared with current fuels LNG: 

  ● Produces up to 20% less carbon dioxide ● Cuts sulphur emissions by 99% ● Cuts fine particulate emissions by 99% ● Produces 85% less nitrogen oxide 

  LNG-powered vessels will therefore not only comply with, but considerably surpass, the IMO regulation aimed at reducing sulphur emissions starting in 2020.

  The 2nd generation biofuels In 2019, CMA CGM performed tests with second- generation biofuels, in partnership with IKEA. 

  In the ground-breaking test, sustainable biofuel was blended with conventional marine fossil fuel to power a vessel on a major ocean route. The biofuel is second generation and derived from used cooking oil. It therefore does not compete with agriculturally-derived, edible oils, and has no negative environmental impacts, unlike the first-generation biofuels that caused soil contamination, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. Both tests bunkering with biofuel had a positive outcome, proving that sustainable marine biofuels are technically compatible. These developments show that biofuels are a viable choice to comply with current and future environmental regulations and meet objectives for cutting harmful emissions.

  Sustainable marine biofuels are virtually free of sulphur oxide – SOx and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80- 90% compared with equivalent fossil fuels. The GHG reduction of each biofuel is certified independently by the International Sustainability Carbon Certification (ISCC) system. Discussions are underway with our suppliers to audit the ISCC certification process. 

  Concurrently, hydrogen and kite propulsion systems are being studied since the Group’s experts are convinced that energy transition challenges will be best met with a mix of technologies.

  Xavier Leclercq Vice Président – CMA Ships, CMA CGM Group 

  " Improved hydrodynamics, route optimisation, alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas and second- generation biofuels, we are using all the levers currently available to improve the environmental performance of our fleet. At the same time, we are actively preparing for the future by developing solutions through R&D, such as sail assistance and hydrogen power, which will enable us to further reduce our ships' emissions.”

  Combatting air pollution In addition to carbon dioxide, the Group is concerned about sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxide emissions and fine particulates. Since these emissions threaten public health and air quality, they are governed by ever more stringent international and local regulations. 

  a. Global Sulphur Cap 2020 In October 2016, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) set a 0.5% cap on sulphur in fuel oil effective from 1 January 2020. The cap will cut the quantity of sulphur oxide from vessels by 85% and should significantly improve air quality, particularly for those living in port cities and coastal communities. The IMO regulation springs from Annex VI of the MARPOL Protocol on the prevention of air pollution from ships. The Group has set up a dedicated working group (Countdown 2020 Work Group) that brings together representatives from many departments 

  at the head office (Bunkering, Operational Management, Sales Representatives, Environmental Department, Legal Department, etc.) who are tasked with anticipating all the issues arising from the new regulatory obligation and thus ensuring compliance by the Group: purchase of fuel oil, cleaning the tanks, procurement outlook, etc. 

  CMA CGM plans ahead and studies all technological solutions likely to promote compliance, such as LNG power, low sulphur fuel, and scrubber systems ● Testing new fuel formulations with a 0.5% cap on 

  sulphur content in conjunction with our suppliers ● Programme to clean tanks and use up heavy fuel oil 

  stocks before 1 January ● Ordering 20 LNG-powered vessels ● Deciding to install hybrid scrubbers that can operate in both open and closed loop mode. Scrubbers “clean” exhaust gases, capturing sulphur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) particles in water. The wastewater is then stored for treatment on shore. To control each step leading up to the disposal of this

  special waste and ensure it is handled following the highest environmental standards, the Group performs audits to select waste transporters and available 

  effluent treatment plants. In 2019, the average sulphur content in fuel oil purchased by the Group was 2.1%. 

  b. Shore-to-ship power In California, since 2014 local regulations have required shipping companies to connect to and use shore power, instead of auxiliary 

  engines. The percentage of fleet calls required to use shore power was increased from the initial 50% to 70% in 2017, thereby reducing fuel consumption and related air emissions by an additional 20%. To ensure regulatory compliance of our vessels and calls, thirty CMA CGM ships were equipped with alternative maritime power systems. Starting on 1 January 2020, the percentage of required shore power connections increased to 80%. The Operations and Chartering Departments, along with our subsidiary that manages owned vessels, are involved to ensure the compliance of the fleet deployed in California. Our vessels fitted with this technology connect to the shore in China on a voluntary basis in suitably equipped ports. The technology has prevented the emission of some 20,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, 10 tonnes of sulphur oxide, 355 tonnes of nitrogen oxide and 24 tonnes of PM10.

  c. Emission Control Areas

  Emission Control Areas

  There are currently three large areas where sulphur emissions from ships are regulated: Northern Europe, North America and, since 2018, China. 

  In 2016 China established Emission Control Areas (ECA) in its territorial waters in order to handle the persistent problem of air pollution. The environmental programme entered an additional phase on 1 January 2019, under which all vessels entering the Emission Control Areas are required to use fuel oil with a maximum sulphur content of 0.5%.

  All of the Group’s vessels comply with the Chinese requirements. The necessary bunker purchases were planned in advance to guarantee full compliance when the new requirements entered into force.

  Customer solutions Customer services pertaining to carbon Shipping customers increasingly seek environmental information on the services they buy. Customers request environmental and other CSR information approximately 20% of total cargo carried. The growing emphasis on the carbon footprint in the choice of shipper explains the Group’s efforts to offer more and more premium customers tailored services focusing on their various impacts. The trend can be seen in the growing number of shipping customers joining the Clean Cargo Working Group. The autumn 2019 session boasted more than 18 new members, including Amazon, Levi’s, Primark and Shark. For the first time in the history of the working group, the number of shipping customers exceeded the number of shippers. 

  The most frequent customer questions in 2019 dealt with the carbon footprint of their freight shipped with CMA CGM. Already in 2011, the Group developed its "Eco Calculator” in reply to these requests, to estimate the carbon footprint of maritime shipments port-to-port. The Eco Calculator is available on our website and on the websites of our subsidiaries under their own brands. 

  Since 2013, in compliance with French regulations, all Group customers logged on to our e-commerce platform have automatically received a calculation of the carbon footprint of each booking, both maritime and shore-side. 

  My Carbon Reporting The Group also provides a service, entering its fourth consecutive year, of carbon footprint reports for all bookings of a given customer. 

  In 2019, 113 Group customers (compared to 85 in 2018) were chosen for the service based on their shipment volumes and environmental implications. They received an analysis breaking down their door-to-door carbon emissions by trade and by transport mode.

  The Customer Agency Network and CSR Department are working together to enable the Group to expand its portfolio of sustainable services. 

  To guarantee customers highly reliable environmental data, the methodology used for all carbon data disclosures is audited and certified by KPMG as an independent third party. 

  Carbon optimization studies Transporting cargo on container ships creates a lower tonne-kilometre carbon footprint than other modes of transport. 

  To seize on this, the Environment department provides the Group’s business lines with technical support so they can highlight the value of the new maritime services on offer. The purpose is to quantify the excellence of our environmental performance compared to other competing sea or inland solutions. For example, a study was carried out to encourage the shift from road transport to the Morocco Shuttle for the refrigerated transport of cherry tomatoes between Agadir and Dakhla 

  In addition to shipping and port operations, the CMA CGM Group designs and implements multi-modal logistics solutions. These pre- and post-shipment solutions enable the Group to offer customers comprehensive transport solutions that are also environmentally-friendly. 

  Sustainability pact For customers with a particularly progressive CSR approach, the Group suggests signing a sustainability pact. The non-legally binding document is an agreement in principle between both parties that covers the implementation of all methods likely to minimise their

  joint impact on the environment. An example is the identification of “green corridors”. The partners also undertake to actively seek out synergies and opportunities for practical, positive community action wherever they are established. Two new sustainability pacts were signed in 2019, with international freight forwarders Kuehne Nagel and Bolloré Logistics. As for shipping customers, Perrier and Inditex have taken their stand for sustainability alongside the Group. 

  Sustainability pacts hinge on four main concerns: the environment (both partners have official carbon reduction goals for 2025 and systematically seek out any joint opportunity for timely achievement of these goals); social policy within both groups; observance of an official Code of Ethics; and active examination of the company’s role within the broader community.

  Qualification IWAY 

  The CMA CGM Group has ben IWAY-certified since 2009. In July 2018, the certification was successfully renewed with no failings noted by the auditor, who expressed his « great satisfaction as to the quality, transparency and expertise of the various persons involved in the process ». In the coming years, IKEA’s expectations will focus on developing business projects involving intermodal transport, marine bioenergy, and compliance with Sulphur Cap 2020.

  2. Biodiversity protection 

  Spills and containers lost at sea Spills, particularly oil spills from Group vessels or terminals, are our greatest environmental risk. A set of measures is in place to mitigate this risk, such as fleet maintenance, routine drills and simulations both on- board and on-shore, and a strong crisis management policy. 

  There are several types of marine pollution: ● Fuel oil ● Oil ● Chemicals ● Sludge These types of pollution are prevented with on-board equipment, human management, and the entire set of operational and inspection procedures in place. 

  First, the vessels are equipped with Ship Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (SOPEP) materials such as dispersants, rags, saw dust, protective goggles, shovels, buckets, portable pumps, absorbent pads, gloves and bags.

  Liquid waste is managed with instruments that comply with regulations. For example, an oily water separator is used to control the maximum oil content of effluent discharged at sea from a vessel en route , i.e. 15 parts per million. The separator on some ships can even achieve a mere 5 parts per million. Human management and procedures play a crucial role in pollution prevention. 

  The teams have entered into partnerships with: ● The Marseilles naval fire brigade Bataillon des Marins Pompiers : fire and oil spill drills are organised on 

  board in a continuous improvement approach. ● The French centre for documentation, research and experimentation on accidental water spills Le Cèdre ( Centre de documentation, de recherche et d'expérimentations sur les pollutions accidentelles des eaux ). CMA CGM personnel are trained every 

  year at this centre based in Brest, Brittany. ● Specific organisations, such as ECM, act as the point of contact between the Group and the United States Coast Guards.

  According to the World Shipping Council 14 , 2,000 containers were lost at sea worldwide every year from 2006 to 2013 primarily due to difficult navigation conditions or rare incidents. In 2019, the CMA CGM Group lost only one empty container. – see table on page 149: Number of major maritime events 

  When containers are lost at sea, it is generally due to the shipping customer declaring a lower weight of the container. Poor weather increases the risk. Every effort is made to prevent losing containers: weather watch, fleet navigation centres, weather routing, and an on-board container security system. The CMA CGM Group began talks with the French ship-owners’ association Armateurs de Fran ce and the relevant authorities to further reduce the risk of losing containers at sea. – see page 128: Cargo Security

  discharged at sea is fully free of any species that could affect marine biodiversity. 

  The United States has also implemented local regulations on the treatment of ballast water. The country approved 25 ballast water treatment systems that comply with its own regulations, which are more stringent than international regulations. CMA CGM vessels are equipped with approved systems and must treat their ballast water via one of these systems before discharging them into American waters. 

  The Group has set up a schedule for installing the systems on its owned fleet, in accordance with the requirements of the international convention and American regulations. To date 99 vessels of the Group have been equipped. 

  b. Inspection des coques par drone sous- 

  marin : projet pilote avec Notilo Plus CMA SHIPS is going to start using ten underwater drones for hull inspections. The project came to fruition after several months of

  Charte Bleue – Armateurs de France is a Charter that seeks to ensure safety at sea and promote respect for the environment. It covers pollution prevention and management, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and efficient waste management 

  Protecting ecosystems Biodiversity protection overwhelmingly involves risk management pertaining to liquid or solid discharge at sea. However, container ships also have a potential impact on biodiversity due to their negative impact on marine species. 

  a. Ballast water treatment system Ballasts are tanks filled with sea water located on both sides of a vessel that ensure stability and structural integrity. Ballast water contains living species that can disrupt local fauna and flora when discharged. The IMO’s convention on ballast water management was adopted in February 2004, ratified in 2016 and entered into force on 8 September 2017. 

  CMA CGM prepared for the entry into force of the convention by installing ballast water treatment systems on most new vessels, thereby ensuring that ballast water

  collaboration with Notilo Plus, which developed the drone and a digital monitoring platform with customised algorithms. The drones: ● Improve hydrodynamic performance ● Monitor hull deterioration better ● Guarantee the seaworthiness of ships in areas of risk. Preliminary testing is underway in Marseilles, on the CAP CAMARAT. Notilo Plus was the first start-up to win the Jacques Saadé Prize at the Trophées de l'Economie in 2018. It benefited from business acceleration support at ZEBOX, the business incubator and accelerator founded by CMA CGM.

**************************** Page 53****************************

  c. Other eco-technologies: FORS, double 

  hulls, additional tanks for bilge water In addition to the ballast water treatment system, the owned fleet features many technologies that limit its impact on biodiversity. The Fast Oil Recovery System (FORS) is a simple, reliable and safe system for managing oil spills. As its name implies, if a vessel is grounded FORS makes it possible to quickly recover bunker oil through a system of standardised connectors. The technology has been installed on 57 vessels. Up until 2010, the fuel oil tanks of container ships were generally single hulled. Since the MARPOL 12A rule took effect (circa 2010), they have been double hulled. A double hull on fuel tanks prevents oil spills in the event of collision or piercing of the ship’s hull. Additional tanks installed on our newly built ships make it possible to treat bilge water and greywater more effectively. 

  a. Cetaceans and marine mammals Several programmes are in place in the United States and Canada to protect cetaceans (whales, dolphins, narwhals, etc.). On the eastern coast, CMA CGM ships must reduce their speed to 10 knots at most in certain areas recognised as cetacean breeding sites. 

  On the western coast, CMA CGM has voluntarily committed to the “Green Flag” speed reduction programme that was established in the sanctuary close to the Santa Barbara islands. Between 1 May and 15 November 2019, CMA CGM took part in a voluntary campaign to reduce the speed of ships, which was organised by the NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS). The port of Long Beach recognised CMA CGM for its almost 100% compliance in lowering the speed of its container ships. 

  Elsewhere, the Group uses the Fleet Navigation Center to watch out for areas where it is recommended to lower the speed of vessels. The Group endeavours to slow down vessels at the earliest opportunity to limit the risk of ship strikes in these sanctuaries. – see page 122: Fleet Navigation Centre: state-of-the-art technological resources 

  In the Pelagos and Agoa sanctuaries, French vessels are equipped with a new tool, REPCET®. The on-board computer system allows the community of subscribers to report, share and receive cetacean positions in real time. Springing from 10 years of joint effort between shipping companies, environmental stakeholders and engineers, REPCET® is the first on-board computer system for

  monitoring whale positions. Its aim is to limit the risk of ship strikes, one of the leading causes of accidental death of large cetaceans. 

  d. Endangered species To limit the transport of endangered species, the Group has set up procedures during the order process so staff can report this type of cargo. – see page 128: Cargo Security

  Voluntary environmental initiatives CMA SHIPS’s ISO 14001 certification has been renewed until 2022, after the 2019 audits found no major form of non- compliance. The absence of major failings confirmed the maturity of our management, environmental, quality and safety system. 

  The CMA CGM Group is an active member of diverse environmental programmes focused on ocean preservation, animal protection and air quality. Below are some of the highlights of 2019: 

  ESI Focus – Environmental Shipping Index 

  WPCI – World Port Climate Initiative is an initiative launched by the major ports of the world, which pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions through the ESI - Environmental Ship Index. The ESI is a platform for collecting and noting environmental information from registered vessels, in particular concerning greenhouse gases and atmospheric pollutants. Based on quarterly updated data, the ports “reward” the best performing vessels. Note that the ports of Longbeach (Green Flag Incentive Program), New York (Clean Vessels Incentive Program) and Vancouver (Blue Circle), rely on the ESI rating to reward the most performing according to their own local programs 

  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 54

  


**************************** Page 55****************************

  ● The CMA CGM Group received accolades from ISO 14001 in Spain, the Green Flag programme in California, the 

  Clean Vessels Incentive in New York and the Blue Circle in Vancouver ● Environmental Ship Index (ESI). The group has been taking part in this initiative for several years in 16 ports in Europe, the United States and in Asia. In 2019, two new agreements were signed: with the port of Dunkirk and the Port Authority of New South Wales (Sydney Harbour and Port Botany in Australia). 

  3. Resources, raw materials and waste

  The circular economy is an economic concept in sustainable development that sets forth the objective of producing goods and services with minimal use and waste of raw materials, water and energy. As a shipping and logistics operator, CMA CGM is an active player in the circular economy due to its involvement at all phases of transporting raw materials, semi-finished and finished consumer goods and end-of-life products, depending on the needs of its customers. The Group pays special attention to the responsible use of resources, raw materials and consumables.

  Replacing incinerators with new-generation compactors, eliminating air pollution Formally prohibiting throwing waste overboard (except for food waste) Optimising waste recovery streams on short 

  In this way, the quantities of waste produced are monitored, updated and reported, and specific training sessions are conducted on board and on land. 

  Indicators 2018 2019

  Recycling and waste treatment

  Production of solid waste by the owned fleet In thousands of tonnes 15

  A variety of waste is produced by the owned fleet: ● Solid waste including food scraps and general 

  domestic or maintenance waste ● Liquid waste from sewage, oily water and sludge. 

  a. Solid waste The Group has committed to an innovative, exemplary green approach to exceed the requirements of the MARPOL Protocol: the “Green Ship” Programme. All the Group’s owned vessels, numbering 164, now take part in the programme. The initiative is structured around four key aspects: 

  Sorting all waste 

  15 2018 - 19,289 // 2019 - 19,056 = production of solid waste reported for 2018. CMA SHIPS scope (not including: AML, BS, NSB, MERCOSUL, CPO Fund)

  In 2019, an average of 10 cubic metres of solid waste per ship was generated each month. 

  The programme also lets vessels share “good practices” or “issues encountered”. For example, there is a directory of ports that collect waste for recovery, broken down by type of waste (ink cartridges, plastics, etc.); conversely other ports are not recommended. The goal is to draw up a shared map of ports where waste sorting is taken the most seriously. 

  The programme also makes it possible to set up waste treatment systems. This year, a map of companies equipped to handle asbestos-containing waste was sent to seafarers so this type of waste can be handled with the best available techniques. 

  b. Liquid waste Liquid waste primarily arises from the use of fuel oil (bunker fuel). Vessels run on “residual” fuel oil that contains water and heavy metals. To be combustible, it has to be purified on board. Centrifugal purifiers dilute the water and heavy metals that are separated from the fuel oil. All this waste creates “sludge” which is considered hazardous waste. It is offloaded ashore and directed to land-based waste streams. CMA CGM takes care of the

  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 55

  


**************************** Page 56****************************

  sludge generated by the owned fleet, but for chartered vessels, sludge disposal depends on the charter party. It may be managed by the ship owner or the charterer. 

  A special team was put together in June 2015 to monitor sludge discharge. It refined the method for assessing the quantity of sludge produced. In 2019, the ratio of sludge to bunker fuel consumed was defined as 2.36%. 

  Indicators 2018 2019 Change 

  Sludge production – In thousands of 190 183 -3% tonnes 

  The waste production of the CMA CGM Group’s offices and branches is comparable to standard office activities. The waste generated at dry ports and terminals mainly involves non-hazardous waste (e.g. pallets, wood, shrink wrap) and accounts for less than 1,200 cubic metres per year within the Group’s scope of consolidation (Finance). 

  Ship dismantling Considering current dismantling practices and shipbuilding materials, the end of life of ships is potentially a major issue for the industry. Pending the ratification of the Hong Kong international convention, in 2008, the Group began establishing inventories of hazardous materials (IHM) on board, which will eventually be compulsory. The Group has proactively undertaken a vast plan to install or update the IHM for the entire owned fleet. The Group is continuing its regulatory and technical watch, as well as research with dismantling sites in Europe and Asia. The sites are audited in accordance with the guidelines of the Hong Kong Convention. It should be noted that the Group’s fleet is one of the youngest in the industry and the vessels are usually sold before their end of life. Nevertheless, whenever a vessel must be sent for dismantling, the group takes measures to send it to a dismantling site that complies with local and international health, safety and environmental standards. First, the Group uses the BIMCO model contract on safe, ecological ship recycling to anticipate and control all steps through to complete recycling of the ship. A basic groundwork has been defined to bolster our strategy and limit environmental and safety risks: 

  ● Primary cutting prohibited in the intertidal zone ● Cutting performed in an impermeable area

  ● Safety/security and environmental procedures in 

  place at the dismantling site ● Specific procedures on hazardous waste management, including temporary storage at the dismantling site 

  In 2019, three Group vessels were sent for dismantling to an internationally-certified site: 

  ● APL JAPAN, 24 years old ● APL KOREA, 22 years old ● APL SINGAPORE, 24 years old 

  The Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative (-SRTI) is a platform for reporting information on ship recycling against a set of predefined disclosure criteria developed jointly by key stakeholders of the maritime industry.

  Water consumption at the 

  terminals Water consumption is not a significant issue for the CMA CGM Group’s maritime transport activity. Actually, water consumption on ships is neutral since sea water is pumped in, desalinated and treated for everyday use on board. 

  For the terminals, water consumption mainly stems from washing materials handling vehicles, quays and containers. Most of the sites are located close to other port industries that produce a lot of dust, thereby requiring frequent washing of the working environments. In 2019, within the Group’s scope of consolidation, total water consumption amounted to 516,944 cubic metres.

  Bamboo flooring: 

  Standard containers have wood flooring to hold cargo. The wood used traditionally comes from an exotic tree that takes 60 years to mature and is becoming increasingly rare. New wood species were looked into, and bamboo was chosen for its outstanding properties. Bamboo grows back after harvesting, and only takes four to five years to mature. At present, there are 586,500

  The Code of Ethics is the cornerstone of CMA CMA’s commitment to maintain the highest standards of business ethics, personal integrity and compliance in all of its business activities. 

  The Code of Ethics applies worldwide to all subsidiaries, affiliates, partnerships, joint ventures and other business arrangements directly or indirectly controlled by CMA CGM, as well as all CMA CGM Group employees, regardless of their status or geographic location. 

  . Its main principles are included in CMA CGM’s Third Party Code of Conduct applicable to all Group’s partners.

  The Code of Ethics is available in French, English, Arabic, Korean, Spanish, Japanese, Mandarin, Portuguese and Russian.

  1. Business ethics and integrity CMA CGM Group has continued to strengthen its anti- corruption and influence peddling programme by complying with the requirements of applicable laws, including the French Sapin II Law (A). It has also established and revised specific Compliance procedures

  for the Group (B) while taking part in joint actions with other shipping players (C).

  Compliance with the requirements of the French Sapin II Law

  In 2019, the Group continued to develop an anti- corruption programme including the eight pillars of the French Sapin II Law on corruption and influence peddling. This involved: 

  ● La Introducing an Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct, an integral part of the Rules of Procedure for companies established in France, while concurrently updating the Code of Ethics. The Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct incorporates applicable anti- corruption and influence peddling rules and 

  disciplinary sanctions in the event of breach. ● Generalising a whistleblowing platform (Ethics Hotline) to enable employees and third parties to report the existence of conduct or situations contrary 

  to the Group’s Code of Ethics. ● Performing risk mapping under the responsibility of the Group’s Risk Management Department to identify, assess, rank and manage the corruption risks to which the Group is exposed.

  ● It also serves to provide Management and those in charge of Compliance with the information needed to implement measures for detecting and preventing 

  corruption risk in line with identified challenges. ● Strengthening and updating procedures (due diligence) to assess compliance of CMA CGM’s 

  partners, intermediaries, suppliers and customers. ● Introducing internal and external accounting control procedures to ensure that ledgers, registers and financial statements are not used to conceal acts of 

  corruption or influence peddling. ● Updating a classroom-based and e-learning training system for the Group’s executives and other employees most exposed to the risks of corruption 

  and influence peddling. ● Having the Internal Audit Department perform an assessment of the anti-corruption compliance system.

  Les Group compliance policies In 2019, the CMA CGM Group established and revised various business ethics and integrity policies, as part of its global compliance programme in application of the French Sapin II law. 

  The Code of Ethics, as mentioned in the introduction, applies to the entire CMA CGM Group. 

  The Third-Party Code of Conduct applies to all “business partners”, individuals or organisations that do business with CMA CGM, including suppliers, intermediaries, dealers, distributors, subcontractors, consultants and joint ventures. All 

  our business partners are required to adhere to and stringently apply our Third-Party Code of Conduct and any other equivalent rules. 

  The Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct is included in the Rules of Procedure of all CMA CGM Group entities located in France. 

  The Gifts and Hospitality Policy describes acceptable and prohibited behaviours for CMA CGM employees. Whenever they are not reasonable, gifts, meals, travel, accommodation, marketing and recreational events may be considered bribes. As a result, all CMA CGM Group employees must display honesty and transparency in these areas, so that their behaviour may in no way be construed as the acceptance or offering of a bribe.

  The Conflicts of Interest Policy requires all “key people”, a list of whom is included in the appendix, to sign an annual conflict of interest disclosure statement. All other CMA CGM Group employees must report any potential risk of conflict of interest they encounter. Conflicts of interest must be reported using the Ethics Hotline. However, an alternative procedure is available for employees who do not have access to the Internet. 

  The Interest Representatives Policy , applicable since January 2019, defines the applicable rules of ethics and conduct and lays down a “due diligence” procedure before CMA CGM hires any interest representative. 

  The CMA CGM Group has also developed a compliance “due diligence” procedure applicable to third parties with whom CMA CGM intends to develop a business relationship. Given the sectors in which it operates, CMA CGM has business relationships with numerous third parties (customers, suppliers, subcontractors, intermediaries, brokers, co- investors, etc.). By exercising vigilance regarding the integrity of the third parties with which it does business, the Group enforces its anti-corruption policy.

  Group compliance within the maritime industry 

  Since March 2014, the Group has been a member of the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN), which combats corruption in the port and shipping industry. The MACN is a global business network working towards a maritime industry free of corruption, which promotes fair trade for the benefit of society at large. 

  In 2019, the network had over 120 members from the maritime industry. The BSR, a non- governmental organisation, provides the Secretariat function for MACN from Copenhagen. Its responsibility is to advance MACN’s initiatives and prepare various tools, communication or otherwise, for use by its members. 

  The MACN network structures its work around three core areas:

  COLLECTIVE ACTION 

  Working with governments, non-governmental organisations and civil society to identify and mitigate the root causes of corruption and improving the operational environment.

  STRENGTHENING CAPACITIES 

  Assisting member companies in implementing MACN’s anti- corruption principles, developing tools and sharing best practices within the network.

  CULTURE OF INTEGRITY 

  Raising awareness of challenges and enhancing integrity standards within the maritime community.

  Implementation of a transparent tax policy: The Group has adopted a responsible, transparent approach to tax issues. The tax function is structured in order to ensure Group compliance with tax regulations in all countries where the Group operates. An internal tax control has also been set up. The companies and operating activities of the Group in countries with lower tax rates than France are justified by the existence of commercial purposes. For intercompany transactions, the Group aligns its policy with OECD transfer pricing principles.

  2. Compliance with economic sanctions 

  The ever-changing requirements in this area call for

  Closely linked with geopolitics 

  Requires compliance with European and US regulations 

  As a leading French player in maritime container shipping and logistics, the CMA CGM Group must comply with regulations regarding economic sanctions. A dedicated team within the Legal Department helps enforce CMA CGM’s security and compliance approach alongside employee awareness-raising initiatives on economic sanctions issues.

  constant monitoring of regulatory developments, close cooperation with the relevant national and international authorities as well as empowerment of all staff through access to an interactive platform enabling them to understand guidelines and best practices for working with high risk countries and exports. 

  CMA CGM has also bolstered its compliance approach to economic sanctions through a training programme including a mandatory e-learning module for all employees and classroom-based training courses (new hires, dedicated business lines, etc.).

  3. Competition The CMA CGM Group has made employees’ knowledge of and compliance with competition law one of its top priorities. Following the 2008 maritime conferences in Europe, the Group set up a competition compliance programme. Its aim is to ensure that all Group entities and business lines in France and abroad comply with competition law. The Group’s competition compliance programme applies to all Group employees, in particular regarding their relations with customers, competitors, partners and suppliers. 

  A team of lawyers specialised in competition law within the Group’s Legal Department conducts numerous online or classroom-based training courses worldwide to all employees and new hires. A best practices guideline, memos and regular publications on competition law news are broadly disseminated within the Group.

  In the event of doubt, employees are strongly encouraged to consult the Competition Compliance division of the Legal Department or their local correspondents to ensure that their actions are compliant. Any breach of competition rules by an employee can be reported using the Ethics Hotline whistleblowing platform. 

  Suppliers and service providers from whom the Group purchases goods and services are also required to comply with the Group’s policy on competition law. The Group implements specific measures when it acquires companies or creates joint ventures with partners in order to comply with the competition rules applicable to such transactions.

**************************** Page 66****************************

  4. Personal data protection For the past several years, CMA CGM has applied a personal data protection policy to its information systems and subcontractors. 

  CMA CGM implements the organisational and technical means to protect the personal data of data subjects (customers, suppliers, employees, third parties) and extends its compliance policy to subcontractors and subsidiaries to guarantee compliance with European personal data protection rules worldwide.

  To apply its policy on personal data protection, the Group has set up: 

  ● An intra-group data protection policy; ● A network of Data Protection Officers (DPOs); ● A training plan for employees; ● An audit plan. 

  Le The DPO appointed by the Group ensures that the personal data protection policy is properly applied.

  Compliance: corporate culture achieved through awareness-raising initiatives and training for all

  Compliance culture is promoted within the Group in various ways: ● "Tone at the top": Top executives and managers regularly remind teams of the importance of complying with business ethics and ensuring that the projects they supervise are dealt with in an ethical manner, in accordance with applicable laws, the Code of Ethics, and internal policies and 

  procedures; ● Adapting the compliance approach based on perceived risk: the focus should be on sectors with high risk of non-compliance by adapting compliance 

  efforts based on our risk map; ● Dissemination of policies over the intranet: employees can consult documentation on the Group’s policies and procedures relating to its compliance programme on a dedicated page on the intranet. Tools are also available for employees, including those enabling the identification of countries subject to economic sanctions. Our Code of Ethics, Third Party Code of Conduct and various Ethics and Compliance policies are available to the public at www.cma-cgm.com(“Ethics and Compliance” space);

  ● Employee training. Training is also a key component of the Group’s Compliance policy: Classroom-based training courses are held regularly both at head office and elsewhere in France for employees most exposed to compliance risk. E-learning training modules on ethics and compliance are mandatory for Group 

  employees. They are regularly updated. - All new employees are required to follow a training course on ethics and compliance. They must read and sign the Code of Ethics online before starting their employment contract. They then receive a reminder email concerning all the e-learning modules on compliance that they are required to take. Since 2019, awareness-raising initiatives on competition law, preventing and combating corruption and influence peddling, economic sanctions and personal data protection are conducted by a member of the Ethics & Compliance Department as part of induction training for new employees.

  Whistleblowing system: Ethics Hotline 

  The reporting of potential or proven breaches to laws,

  regulations, Group policies or procedures are embodied in the Code of Ethics, which fosters accountability among employees with regard to ethical conduct. 

  The website http://cma-cgm.ethicspoint.com enables CMA CGM employees and third parties to: 

  ● Ask the Ethics & Compliance Department questions; ● Make a report using an online form; ● Make a report by calling a dedicated phone number (listed per country and available on the Group’s 

  website or the intranet); ● Remain anonymous if they wish and local 

  regulations allow; ● Access a 24/7 platform; ● Protect their identity. 

  Launched in 2019, the Ethics Hotline system may be used to collect statistics on reports made. The whistleblowing system, online or by telephone, is open to all Group employees and third parties, including suppliers and subcontractors. It is available 24/7 in several languages.

  It ensures that whistle-blowers remain anonymous if they wish and local regulations permit. An in-house procedure provides the framework for reports made under the whistleblowing system, specifying the rights and obligations of each party. A non-retaliation policy is in place to protect whistle-blowers against all forms of retaliation. 

  The CMA CGM Group undertakes to protect individuals who, in good faith, report a potential breach of law or internal policies. 

  Consequently, employees are encouraged to use any means possible to report any breach of the Code of Ethics, compliance policies or applicable procedures and regulations to Management, their line managers or the Group Ethics & Compliance Department, including: 

  ● Fraud and/or corruption; ● Anti-competition practices; ● Respect for human rights; ● And, more generally, any potential breach of the Group’s Code of Ethics or policies.

  French law on due care – due care plan – effectiveness report 

  The French law on due care ( Loi sur le Devoir de Vigilance ) was adopted in 2017. It requires parent companies and subcontracting companies to implement reasonable measures regarding risks to human rights and fundamental freedoms, health, safety and the environment resulting from their own operations and those of their subsidiaries, subcontractors and suppliers. 

  The law requires five measures to be implemented: 

  ● Draft a due care risk map ● Define a risk assessment procedure ● Implement suitable actions ● Set up a whistleblowing system ● Set up a monitoring and assessment scheme

  The purpose of the law is to identify, monitor and implement actions regarding due care risks, as part of a continuous improvement approach. 

  Upon adoption of the law, CMA CGM set up a cross- functional working group comprising members of the CSR, Risk Management and Procurement functions to address the five measures, with the initial objectives of: 

  1. Adapting the due care law to the CMA CGM Group’s organisation, by: ● Identifying all actions undertaken by the Group 

  regarding health, safety, the environment and people ● Identifying the scope and breaking down the Group’s 

  business activities: - Within the company: office-based activities, 

  operational maritime and terminal activities - Outside the company: suppliers and subcontractors 

  2. Identifying and assessing risks and defining controls and action plans to mitigate them. 

  This year, we reinforced our implementation of and actions provided for in the due care law by: 

  ● Bolstering our risk identification and assessment 

  system within the Group; ● Extending the risk map scope: including the “Logistics and intermodal” business activities for the Group, excluding CEVA Logistics business and identifying risks 

  per product category; ● Identifying Group steering indicators, including a 

  Human Rights indicator; ● Enhancing Sustainable Procurement policy. 

  As part of this continuous improvement approach, we have defined the areas we would like to reinforce in 2020: 

  ● Bolster due care governance at Group and Site and operational level, with the Sustainability Department 

  in charge of such governance; ● Include the CEVA Logistics subsidiary; ● Continue identifying performance indicators and 

  objectify them; ● Strengthen controls relating to due care risks as part 

  of the Group’s Internal Audit programme; ● Extend the due care risk analysis to the “customer” scope.

**************************** Page 69****************************

  Mesure 1 : Draft a due care risk map 

  An initial Group due care risk map was drafted by reviewing all risks already identified in the various departments. An assessment of risks relating to fundamental freedoms, health and safety of people and the environment that are not covered by existing maps, based on the Risk Management Department’s methodology, was also performed. A risk assessment by operational purchase category was performed with a focus on risks relating to the French due care and Sapin II laws. 

  The scope includes the following activities: Office-based activities in France and abroad, operational maritime activities, terminal suppliers and subcontractors. 

  An initial risk breakdown and assessment was performed with the creation of: ● Five Fundamental Freedoms, Human Rights and 

  Health, Safety and Security risk categories ● Five Environment risk categories ● Six Procurement risk categories 

  In 2019, the 2018 risk map was reviewed. The scope was extended to include the “logistics and intermodal” 18 business comprising: owned assets over various countries across all continents and suppliers and subcontractors that form part of the sustainable procurement programme. The main risks identified for this activity relate to human rights, working conditions and labour law, in particular with regard to local subcontractors/suppliers; and the environment, major risks of pollution (in particular water/soil) and waste management in general. 

  Supplier and subcontractor risk assessments were extended in collaboration with the Group’s Risk Management Department. The scope was extended and action plans identified. Consolidated mapping will be performed in 2020 to highlight the Group’s overall exposure to each risk and enable the main challenges to be dealt with in a uniform manner. 

  The updates and scope extension highlighted the following main due care risks for the Group: ● Risks to the health and safety of people and security 

  risks abroad; ● Risks of pollution and harm to biodiversity; ● Risks relating to climate change and air pollution; 

  18 The CEVA Logistics subsidiary was excluded from this scope for 2019

  ● Risks relating to the employment of 

  subcontractors/suppliers; ● Risks relating to the dismantling of vessels. 

  The risk of non-compliance with the due care law was included in the 2018 map of major Group risks. This risk map is updated quarterly and presented at meetings of the Audit and Risk / Audit and Accounting Committees.

**************************** Page 70****************************

  Mesure 2 : Define a risk assessment procedure Alongside updating the due care risk map, the Group holds numerous discussions and meetings to validate and find solutions to identified risks. The following is a non- exhaustive list: ● Every year, the Group is assessed by the business sustainability rating firm EcoVadis. The assessment questionnaire includes numerous questions relating 

  to the due care law. ● In 2019, CMA CGM was awarded Gold status for the fifth consecutive year, with a substantially higher rating in particular due to progress in the human 

  resources category. ● In 2019, the Group held discussions with customers, suppliers, organisations and other stakeholders on due care issues to share feedback, ideas and identify 

  areas for improvement. ● The Group also performed a regulatory watch on the due care law to gain a better understanding of 

  stakeholder requirements. ● Legal notices and summons were also monitored and 

  analysed in order to define and implement: - Corrective actions for the Group; - Suitable actions if a trading partner had been summoned or given notice for non-compliance with the due care plan, in particular at the Purchasing Department’s Selection committee (Comité de 

  Triage) meetings. ● At the end of 2019, the Group joined the United Nations Global Compact. Nine of the ten principles are directly related to the due care law. As a participant the Group is required to prepare a Communication on 

  Progress (CoP) on the Ten Principles as of 2020. ● The CMA CGM Group participates in various cooperative work groups such as Clean Cargo, the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network, the ContainerShip Safety Programme, Cargo Incident Notification Scheme, and Business Actions to Stop Counterfeiting & Piracy. The purpose of these intercompany working groups and organisations is to foster dialogue and share best practices for continuous improvement at both strategic and operational level.

  Mesure 3 : Implement suitable actions 

  When updating the risk map for each activity, an action plan is defined, per activity and risk category. The following items are updated on an annual basis: 

  ● Fundamental freedoms, working conditions : ongoing dialogue with staff representative bodies, trade union agreements concerning working time organisation, procedures for compliance with the Maritime Labour 

  Convention regulations for seafaring personnel ● Health and safety of people : Policy, annual goals and action plans. Prevention campaign via the reporting of near misses, Accident Prevention Committee for the fleet, specific programme on quality of life at the workplace and the prevention of asbestos risk, policy and procedures in connection with employee travel to 

  high risk countries (Travelsafe), etc. ● Environment : crisis management plan in the event of major pollution, programme to equip the entire fleet with a ballast water treatment system, policy and goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per transported container by 30% between 2015 and 2025, investment in Liquefied Natural Gas-powered vessels, scrubbers and low-sulphur fuel especially in relation to the Sulphur 2020 regulation, policy for dismantling only in shipyards, which have been audited and certified compliant with the guidelines of the Hong Kong 

  convention, etc. ● Sustainable procurement : In 2019, the CMA CGM Group bolstered Sustainable Procurement initiatives, deploying an overall supplier assessment programme addressing financial aspects, corruption, CSR and due care, economic sanctions, competition, GDPR compliance and raising awareness among all its suppliers and purchasers on these issues: - Evaluation Assessing all new suppliers using our qualification process to better manage supplier risks regarding corruption, human rights breaches and the environment. It is a five-stage digital process:  1- Preliminary definition of the risk level  2- Risk assessment through an internal 

  questionnaire by Cscreen and EcoVadis  3- Analysis  4- Supplier qualification 

   5- Monitoring over time - Enhancing existing documents: adding CSR clauses to our contracts and General Terms and Conditions of Purchase (Due Care, Ethics & Compliance, GDPR compliance, Health, Safety and Security)

  Launching an internal and external awareness-raising 

  campaign among Group purchasers and suppliers - Dedicated organisation: A sustainable procurement division dedicated to raising awareness, supporting

  purchasers, performing second-level controls and 

  setting up an international network of ambassadors - Governance: a supplier risk committee meeting once every two months with all stakeholders, and a Selection committee (Comité de Triage) to facilitate 

  the decision-making process for purchasers - Setting up monitoring indicators as part of a 

  continuous improvement approach To provide optimal support to suppliers in this continuous improvement approach and ultimately impact the entire value chain, the Group encourages its Tier 1 suppliers to draft a Code of Conduct or Code of Ethics for their own suppliers and subcontractors. 

  In 2018, the Group’s Code of Ethics and Third-Party Code of Conduct were updated. In 2019, in order to facilitate discussions and mutual understanding, these two Codes were translated into five additional languages. Other significant events in 2019 included: ● The Compliance unit at head office was enhanced and the global network of Ethics & Compliance correspondents extended - 72 correspondents in more than 100 countries on 5 continents to answer all 

  Ethics & Compliance related questions; ● Training and communication programmes for 

  preventing Ethics & Compliance risks were improved; ● A CSR and Environment Manager joined the CSR Department, which now directly reports to the Deputy 

  Chief Executive Officer; ● The Group’s CSR approach was aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and an order of priority established. 

  With regard to suppliers and subcontractors, special measures were taken in 2019 regarding the combat against concealed employment, in particular by raising awareness among purchasers, prescribers and suppliers, but also by setting up weekly reporting on the due care law. 

  Mesure 4 : Whistleblowing mechanism The reporting of potential or proven breaches to laws, regulations, Group policies or procedures are embodied in the Code of Ethics. Reports are made via a whistleblowing system addressing all of the Group’s internal and external stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, subcontractors, associations, trade unions, etc.) – cf. page 66: Whistleblowing system: Ethics 

  The platform is accessible via the Group’s corporate website http://cma-cgm.ethicspoint.com and provides an outlet to: ● Ask the Ethics & Compliance Department questions;

  ● Make a report using an online form; ● Make a report by calling a dedicated phone number (listed per country and available on the Group’s 

  website or the intranet); ● Remain anonymous if whistleblower so desires and if 

  local regulations so allow; ● Access a 24/7 platform: 

  With regard to the following areas: ● Fraud and/or corruption; ● Anti-competition practices; ● Respect for human rights; ● And, generally, any potential breach to the Group’s Code of Ethics or Policies. 

  NB: Under its non-retaliation policy, the CMA CGM Group undertakes to protect individuals who, in good faith, report a potential breach of law or internal policies. 

  In each business line, systems have been set up to ensure maximum effectiveness: 24/7 hotlines, recording of emergencies relating to the Environment/Health & Safety/Safety of People/Geopolitical and Health Monitoring 

  Mesure 5 : Set up a monitoring and assessment scheme 

  Measures are monitored and their effectiveness assessed by the various departments responsible for their implementation. 

  Qualitative and quantitative data are consolidated quarterly for Operational CSR Committee meetings and an annual summary of progress and action plans for the following year are prepared as part of Corporate Social Responsibility reporting. See “2019 Gaols and Achievements and 2020/21 Action Plan” page 22 

  The reliability and completeness of key performance indicators are audited by the Statutory Auditors as is the case for financial data. 

  The key performance indicators monitored in connection with the due care law are presented in the table below:

  Focus – defining a “Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms” indicator: In 2019, an analysis of qualitative and quantitative Group data relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was performed. A specific analysis was also performed on 2019 reports relating to “Labour“ and “Health/safety”. Several sources were analysed: 

  ● EcoVadis and its “360” external stakeholder inputs – 1 case - EcoVadis is a business sustainability rating firm. Every year, we fill out the EcoVadis questionnaire comprising four themes, three of which are directly related to human rights: Labour & Human Rights, Ethics and Sustainable Procurement. This year, we significantly improved our performance in the “Labour & 

  Human Right” theme. - EcoVadis also performs an additional study using a multitude of data from external stakeholders. The aim is to collect information and opinions, both positive and negative, on companies’ performance regarding labour, the environment and ethics. If a case is significant, for instance, involving a fine, a sanction or conviction, the score for each theme would be negatively impacted. EcoVadis factors in information and data from over 100,000 sources across media, governments, trade unions, NGOs and business networks. 

  ● “Labour” and “Health/Safety” deficiencies and detentions identified during port state controls – 491 deficiencies, including 13 relating to human rights (Maritime Labour Convention) and fundamental freedoms or health and safety in 2019 and one detention. To check the seaworthiness of vessels, the port of call countries carry out regular on-board inspections and port state controls (PSCs). If problems are detected, deficiencies are recorded and may result 

  in the detention of the ship. ● Internal Audits – 70 assignments in 52 countries conducted by the Directorate for Risk Management

  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 72

  


**************************** Page 73****************************

  and Internal Audit to check compliance with rules applicable to the company, including standards, regulations, specifications and customer specifications. The Directorate also checks whether organisational and operational provisions have been established, disseminated, understood and applied, identifies areas for improvement and issues recommendations. The Group’s internal audit 

  programme involves analysing human rights issues. ● Reports from the Group’s whistleblowing mechanism – 54 reports, 20% of which related to Human Rights, Fundamental Freedoms and/or Health issues. 54 reports were issued using the hotline. These reports were systematically analysed and, where applicable, internal investigations were carried out, sometimes resulting in corrective or disciplinary actions. 

  The aim is to identify Human Rights indicators and, ultimately, create a procedure for measuring and assessing the “Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms” risk within the Group.

  1. Customer satisfaction: improving the customer experience at each step of the customer journey 

  Rodolphe Saadé, Chief Executive Officer of the CMA CGM Group, has set all his teams the goal of becoming the top choice for shipping customers. Through the Customer Experience programme, CMA CGM aims to work more closely with customers and treat them as partners by “Caring beyond Shipping”. 

  Accordingly, CMA CGM has drawn up an ambitious transformation plan to enhance all interactions with customers with new expertise, innovative, sustainable product offers, improved services and a simplified customer experience through new technologies.

  Patricia PICINI Head of Global Accounts, Customer Experience & Marketing - CMA CGM Group 

  “In terms of customer experience, we need to listen and take into account the views of each person, throughout their journey and whenever we are in contact” 

  Customer centricity, a concept unveiled at the TPM 19 conference in 2018, is one of the Group’s strategic priorities. It encompasses a programme to improve the customer experience that was launched to help CMA CGM:  Meet new customer expectations  Stand out from competitors with an innovative range 

  of services  Capitalise on its closeness to customers 

  19 TPM, a conference organised by the Journal of Commerce, is one of the shipping industry’s most important events.

  CMA CGM is fully committed to supporting its customers and their development. It has created new value-added services while honing the execution processes for existing products. Through these innovative solutions, the company can specifically address customer needs, thereby making CMA CGM a key partner in their logistics chain. 

  In 2019 the following value-added products were particularly promoted by the Group: 

  Traxens: smart containers, so called because they are equipped with top- of-the-line connected technologies that send data, almost in real time, regarding the movement (position, etc.) and condition of freight (temperature, impact detection, etc.). Customers benefit from better traceability as well as cost optimization tools. 

  Cargo Value SERENITY: the premier product of the SERENITY line offers new guarantees and coverage for our customers to provide compensation for unpredictable events during shipping. Simple, fast and customised, this product promotes more effective and cost-effective management of logistics chain risks.

  Shipfin: a new line of import and export financing services to support our customers’ international development (Supply Chain Financing and Cargo Financing, two complementary, customised solutions). 

  Network: this service facilitates prospecting for our customers, and helps them establish contacts with reliable, trusted partners (currently only in the pilot phase). 

  The CMA CGM Group is also transforming by intensifying its offer for online businesses. For example, the Group improved its digital customer experience by launching CMA CGM eSolutions, a fully digital ecosystem for a secure, simpler and more effective customer experience. 

  With eSolutions, CMA CGM has expanded its offer with a new set of digital features for customers. The products are both easy and fast to use. For example, My Price makes it possible to check negotiated prices, get a quote, or make a booking at the click of the mouse. Customers also now receive instant booking confirmation, and online electronic payment is being gradually rolled out one country at a time. CMA CGM has also created novel services that genuinely stand out from the competition, such as paperless bills of lading. CMA CGM is one of the pioneers in the shipping industry to offer entirely digital bills of lading that can be sent in one click. Paperless bills of lading remove the risk of fraud or document loss and speed up the shipping procedure. 

  It is clear to see how this new sales channel helps customers boost productivity and develop business. 

  For its key accounts, the Group has also designed a programme of services and benefits specifically for business, creating a strong relationship between customers and CMA CGM. 

  To best manage service quality, provide faster response times and work closely with customers, CMA CGM has made changes to its internal organisation and implemented a plan to streamline work processes. Some of the initiatives set up by the Group include a new customer service tool that has been rolled out to improve the experience for employees and increase customer satisfaction and gratitude. It is being gradually adopted by the agencies and shared services centres to ensure end-to-end service quality. It has also been integrated into the eCommerce platform

  and will incorporate other new features throughout the coming year. The Group is also shoring up its in-house training programme on change support. The training provides sales teams the product knowledge they need, and also addresses transformation as it affects the way employees work. Organised by each region, the training will help the whole network adopt a customer centric approach and play an active role in improving the customer experience. 

  Customer satisfaction is a core concern of CMA CGM. As such the company has committed to improving its service quality. In 2015 it set up a Customer Charter, and every year it conducts customer surveys. 

  To provide more visibility on service quality, CMA CGM plans to define and publish a new customer satisfaction indicator: the Net Promoter Score (NPS). The NPS measures the likelihood that a customer would recommend CMA CGM to someone else; by extension it reflects the degree of customer satisfaction. In the annual survey, customers are asked: “ How likely is it that you would recommend CMA CGM to a friend or colleague? ” A score is derived from the positive or negative answers. The annual surveys help CMA CGM discern and analyse customer expectations. The Group has also set up post- transaction surveys for customers to instantaneously give their impressions of a specific event using the new customer service tool. 

  By continually improving the customer experience, CMA CGM pursues customer centricity and speeds up development through: 

  Better knowledge of vertical markets (sales support): determining suitable customer segmentation, sales management and targeted market insights; 

  Better service : a global commitment throughout the entire CMA CGM Group, based on the Group’s customer segmentation; 

  Facilitated business by simplifying processes and providing fresh solutions; 

  Greater transparency by providing reports on carbon emissions, service quality levels, transit times achieved, port conditions, etc.; 

  Bolstered cooperation with our customers (acknowledgement and support given to customers by teams of sector-specific experts).

  Innovation fostering operational performance

  When Rodolphe Saadé took office as Group CEO at the beginning of 2017, one of the first things he did was create an investment structure, a genuine support strategy for innovation. It is called CMA CGM Ventures. Upon its inception, the fund contributed capital to some twenty ventures. The investment philosophy of CMA CGM Ventures is based on three key Group concerns: customer relationships, operating efficiency and employee well-being.

  CMA CGM’s venture capital fund helps new companies in France and elsewhere grow. They benefit day-to-day from CMA CGM’s network and ecosystem of partners, customers and suppliers. The goal is to form lasting operating partnerships with start-ups, with a view to mutual value creation. 

  In 2019, CMA CGM Ventures invested in several innovative start-ups with a strong connection to the

  Indicators 2018 2019 Change Number of companies 85 125 +47% receiving Group funding

  Group’s business lines, such as:

  CMA CGM supports the development of Notilo Plus and has chosen their solution for underwater vessel inspection The CMA CGM Group, a leading global provider of maritime transport and logistics, has opted to support the financial and industrial development of Notilo Plus, a Marseilles-based start-up specialising in autonomous underwater solutions. The support will help the company launch manufacturing. 

  Notilo Plus develops autonomous underwater drones Notilo Plus was founded in 2016 and is based in Marseilles and Lyons. It develops autonomous underwater drones with AI and D&A capabilities for both the shipping industry and leisure use. Last December, Notilo Plus received the Jacques Saadé prize from Rodolphe Saadé, CEO of the CMA CGM Group, at the Trophées de l’Économie 2018 ceremony. In the meantime, Notilo Plus has joined ZEBOX, the international business incubator and accelerator for innovative start-ups in Marseilles. 

  CMA CGM and Notilo Plus sign a cooperation agreement Fully convinced of the potential of the product offered by Notilo Plus, CMA CGM wanted to work with the Notilo Plus teams to develop a specific solution for the Group’s vessels. The system will make it possible to automate – and thereby perform a greater number of – hull inspections, improving vessel productivity and making safety inspections systematic.

  Supporting the economy and local innovation 

  ZEBOX ZEBOX is an international business incubator and accelerator for innovative start-ups, founded in May 2018 on the initiative of Rodolphe Saadé, CEO of CMA CGM. It opened its doors on 27 September that same year. ZEBOX is headed by Matthieu Somekh and leverages a circle of

  corporate partners that are all leaders in their fields: ACCENTURE, BNP Paribas, Centrimex, CEVA, CIMC & EY. ZEBOX brings all these talents together under one roof. It facilitates joint development and creates business opportunities between start-ups and partners. It also fosters the development of innovative solutions for all and creates crucial new players. ZEBOX concentrates on two industries: Industry X.0 and transport, logistics and mobility. Every chosen project centres on cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, virtual or augmented reality, IoT and robotics. ZEBOX offers start-ups two support programmes based on their stage of development. business incubation is aimed at new start-ups, providing support to 15 of them for 12 to 18 months, while business acceleration boosts eight established start-ups for eight months. 

  “Le Carburateur” business incubator and accelerator In 2017, the CMA CGM Group decided to take part in the creation of Le Carburateur , a business incubator and accelerator in the fifteenth district in the north of Marseilles. Le Carburateur brings together comprehensive set of skills under one roof to create a dynamic ecosystem where member entrepreneurs can successfully launch their companies. The incubated companies find advice, workspaces, tools, a network and contacts to get ahead. 

  CMA CGM decided to renew its support in 2019 by making a financial contribution to Le Carburateur for operating costs. The contribution helped Le Carburateur welcome more new companies than in 2018 and offer them new services.

  In 2019, ZEBOX provided support to 30 start-ups : 

   21 through business incubation (including 

  two destined for the Caribbean)  9 through business acceleration 

  More than 300 start-ups interviewed / €7.7 million in capital raised / Around forty new jobs created 

  2020/2021 goals and outlook:  One year after ZEBOX was founded, a new milestone will be reached with the impending opening of a new incubation hub 

  in the Caribbean at the end of the year  To expand ZEBOX’s offer, expertise and network, new non-corporate partnerships are being examined: CEA Tech, Innospace, 

  Digital Hub Logistics Hamburg  A new “Energy” hub will be developed at ZEBOX to address this key topic with such 

  strong applications for shipping and logistics  Creation of specific clusters within the ZEBOX start-up community, such as the Green Tech cluster

**************************** Page 83****************************

  This year, along with our financial support, two new initiatives were rolled out:

  Patronage for start-ups and SMEs 

  Five directors of the CMA CGM Group agreed to mentor five start-ups or SMEs incubated at Le Carburateur . Each director provided concrete help of his choice to entrepreneurs, sometimes giving of his time, sometimes giving tailored advice.

  A new entrepreneurship competition 

  After the success of the call for applications sponsored by CMA CGM in 2017, Le Carburateur and the CMA CGM Group wanted to renew the endeavour this year to stimulate entrepreneurship in southern France. This time they joined forces with two large companies in Provence: PONANT and NGE Group. 

  This year’s competition focused on three topics: 

   Transport, logistics and mobility (sponsored 

  by CMA CGM);  Sustainable tourism (sponsored by PONANT);  Environment trades and sustainable building and infrastructure (sponsored by NGE). 

  After pre-screening by a jury of experts from each company, the grand finale in December brought together nine start-ups who presented their projects before the jury.

**************************** Page 84****************************

  The Group also took part in several summits:

  CMA CGM took part in the Movin’On World Summit on Sustainable Mobility The Movin'On Summit, held from 4 to 6 June in Montréal, brings together almost 5,000 participants, start-ups and speakers every year to discuss sustainable mobility. For its first time at the event, CMA CGM proposed a workshop on cutting the environmental impact of freight shipping. CMA CGM was thus able to present its related service offer, both in terms of the modal transition to maritime transport and the intermodal offer.

  Rodolphe Saadé shares his vision of the Mediterranean of the future 

  Act III of the Méditerranée du Futur forum in Marseilles brought together several hundred people from around the Mediterranean basin. Rodolphe Saadé took the stage as an expert speaker. 

  The CEO of the CMA CGM Group shared his vision for the Mediterranean: 

   Cleaner – the world’s largest LNG container ship, the CMA CGM JACQUES SAADÉ, will be delivered 

  soon  More digital – the ZEBOX business incubator welcomes many start-ups from around the 

  Mediterranean  More appealing to business – the CEVA Logistics head office opened in Marseilles, creating 200 jobs and a genuine logistics hub in the city

  2. Sustainable procurement: establishing lasting relationships with suppliers and subcontractors 

  CMA CGM assigns great value to establishing stable, lasting relationships with its suppliers. To this end, the Group, purchasing advisors, suppliers and subcontractors work in close cooperation. 

  France’s new Sapin II Law and law on due care of parent companies and contracting authorities have led the Group to reinforce oversight arrangements pertaining to anti-corruption, human rights and limiting environmental impact of its business activity. – see page 61: Compliance with requirements of the Sapin II Law 

  Strategically, the Group has opted to work on all these matters simultaneously using a single method so that changes are implemented and appropriated smoothly. 

  CMA CGM ramps up its Sustainable 

  Procurement policy in 2019 In 2019 the CMA CGM Group further promoted sustainable procurement by rolling out a comprehensive supplier assessment arrangement: 

  Ongoing work of the Supplier Risk Committee In 2017 the Group created a Supplier Risk Committee for better management of procurement risks within the Group and to monitor actions in place. In addition to all the line representatives to the procurement department, the Supplier Risk Committee convenes the key stakeholders working in areas concerned by supplier risk (Legal, Compliance, Audit and Risk, Human Resources and CSR departments). At committee meetings, best practices are shared and action plans on regulatory changes concerning suppliers are prepared.

  A multilingual Third-Party Code of Conduct to shore up CSR In 2014 the CMA CGM Group created a Third-Party Code of Conduct. It outlines all of the Group’s CSR commitments and obligations as well as expectations for suppliers and subcontractors. Suppliers considered during calls for tenders and those awarded contracts otherwise must sign the Third-Party Code of Conduct before any agreement is signed. The Code is systematically included in contracts. To strengthen CSR arrangements and promote accountability of suppliers, CSR clauses are added to purchasing agreements and the General Terms of Purchase. – see page 62: Third-Party Code of Conduct 

  The cornerstone: a procurement risk map updated annually In 2018 a procurement risk map has been established at Group level. The risk assessment methodology used is the same as that applied by the Group’s Risk Management department – see page 21: Group risk management and risk maps 

  The “procurement risk” map:  Outlines purchasing areas and regions  Assesses the risks of corruption and economic sanctions and risks to human rights, health & safety, 

  the environment, etc.  Breaks down sub-risks by category of suppliers and 

  intermediaries  Defines action plans aimed at reducing risk 

  The risk map is updated annually by each Procurement department in conjunction with the Group Risk Management department. 

  A single, five-step assessment tool for suppliers and subcontractors to identify and manage procurement risks A worldwide tool for assessing suppliers and intermediaries has been set up. It covers financial aspects, corruption, CSR, economic sanctions, tenders and the GDPR. It is intended to bolster management of supplier risks pertaining to corruption, human rights and the environment. The five-step digital process includes:

**************************** Page 86****************************

  1. Preliminary definition of the risk level 2. Risk assessment through an internal 

  questionnaire by Cscreen and EcoVadis 3. Analysis 4. Supplier qualification 5. Monitoring over time 

  Expanding existing contractual documents : clauses on CSR issues, such as due care, ethics & compliance, GDPR, and Health & Safety, are drafted and appended to contracts. 

  Implementing an awareness programme , both in-house with group buyers and externally with suppliers: In-person training and e-learning; A newsletter for the purchasing community was rolled out; An Intranet that can be consulted by all players was set up; Systematic awareness training is provided for all new arrivals.

  Implementing a risk-specific organisation and network of ambassadors : a procurement unit specifically for awareness training and support for buyers and second level controls, and an international network of ambassadors. 

  Governance : the supplier risk committee meets with all stakeholders every four months (procurement, risk, legal, compliance). There is also a “screening” committee to support buyers with decision-making.

  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 86

  


**************************** Page 87****************************

  Monitoring indicators set up for 

  continuous improvement To measure how effective actions were, new monitoring indicators were identified covering the main procurement risks: 

  Indicators 2019 

  Number of assessed suppliers 348 20 Number of individuals who received 550 o/w 27% Sustainable Purchasing training, as a 

  percentage of salaried buyers Average score of companies assessed 

  by CMA CGM with Cscreen 55/100

  The global supplier and intermediary assessment system was rolled out in 2019 under the supervision of the Group’s Central Purchasing Department, initially with a pilot period of three months before being gradually implemented group-wide. 

  100% of the procurement centres have received training and adopted the system.

  Example of actions set up with suppliers: 

  100% green electricity 

  Purchasing renewable electricity is a top concern for companies today. The Indirect Procurement department in France has signed 100% green electricity contracts to cut direct greenhouse gas emissions. This locks in green electricity costs over a long period and protects against changes to the carbon tax. Five sites in France are now supplied with 100% green electricity, and others will follow!

  1. Diversity within the Group 

  The strength of the CMA CGM Group lies in the diversity of the men and women working there, a diversity which is a key support of its strategy. As a source of inspiration and innovation, diversity helps us to better understand customer expectations and offer them tailored transport solutions and high-quality services. 

  Within the company, diversity takes root from the moment of recruitment. 

  Both in France and abroad, our HR teams are trained in use of the “Thomas International” test to encourage better hiring decisions.

  This assessment tool provides a precise depiction of an individual’s behavioural model in work situations. The test score leads to constructive dialogue with candidates, who can confirm or disagree with the analysis of their professional profile. The “Thomas APP” provides additional information to supplement the assessment made by the recruiter. 

  Diversity within the Group is reflected in gender equality, multiculturalism, and intergenerationality. The resulting emulation encourages mutual enrichment.

  Gender equality For many years, the CMA CGM Group has been committed to promoting gender equality in the workplace.

  In 2020, the programme will continue to be developed in France and other countries.

  This commitment is demonstrated by a strong recruitment, promotion and training policy as well as the organisation of events, such as themed lunches, as a time to share, talk, inform and collect suggestions from female employees and recommend new actions (Women’s Day, Pink October, conferences, communication campaigns, etc.). 

  Some 14% of females working at the Group’s offices hold a management position, while 37% of managers are women. Additionally, 100% of French female seafaring personnel and 64% of international female seafaring personnel are naval officers.

  Addressing disability within the 

  company The CMA CGM Group supports people with special needs during their professional career. At the head office in Marseilles, the Occupational Health department is responsible for identifying people with disabilities. Once the Group has been informed, it provides tailored measures to adjust, adapt or transform work stations to help disabled employees keep their jobs. Some of the main initiatives include work station adaptation (e.g. foot rests, headsets, ergonomic chairs, specific computer hardware, etc.), the provision of a designated parking space, and two days of additional leave for employees with a dependent disabled child. 

  As a further step, in 2018 the Group Human Resources Department initiated a working group examining the

  handling of disability within the company. The goal is to increase awareness of diversity’s rich potential as a source of inspiration and creativity for the company. In 2019, the “All Different” programme sprang from the working group, and several actions have been set up, such as: ● Creation of a specific Group intranet page (objectives, 

  definition of disability, process, contacts) ● Appointment of the company disability officer ● Creation of a specific email address for more effective communication on the topic 

  In Marseilles, the Group Human Resources department also examined the possibility of calling on a specialised company in 2020 to develop IT services (e.g. functional tests of IT applications) with the help of high-functioning autistic individuals and/or individuals with Asperger’s syndrome and/or people with disabilities.

  2. Working conditions 

  An onboarding process to integrate 

  new recruits Integration is an essential issue and has become a major lever in retaining and developing new talent. Onboarding is a decisive period of an employee’s career that deserves our entire attention and requires the involvement of all company stakeholders. 

  The onboarding process implemented in the USA and France is helping the Group impart professional 

  knowledge during employee integration. 

  Even before arriving in the company, new employees benefit from special support in performing administrative formalities. They also receive key information through a digital portal to help them appropriate the company’s culture and values. 

  In 2019, the C&Me Onboarding process was rolled out in Singapore. New recruits now benefit from a more user- friendly information portal. 

  Group Code of Ethics

  In Marseilles, the Jacques R. Saadé Tower houses over 2,500 employees representing 65 different nationalities. 

  To promote dialogue, build new relationships, expand employees’ professional network and foster the integration of new hires, the C-Lunch application was rolled out in 2019. 

  Available in French and English, C-Lunch is an in- house application developed by the Digital Factory teams. It is initially intended for all employees at the Marseilles and Le Havre sites. 

  The simple-to-use application lets employees set up in-house lunches (date, time, topic, number of participants) or look for one and sign up for it.

  The CMA CGM Group strives to give equal opportunities for professional development within the company to all staff. The Code of Ethics clearly outlines the Group’s commitment to diversity and equal opportunity. 

  Our integrity is grounded in respect for and protection of fundamental rights and freedoms as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In line with the declaration, the Group has committed to eliminating discrimination of any kind, based on nationality, class, race, disability, gender, age, religion and political views. 

  More broadly, the Group’s anti-discrimination policy addresses freedom of opinion, job placement and retention for disabled employees and job equality as per the collective bargaining agreement.

  Social dialogue Social dialogue is a vital part of company life. It mainly involves providing employees with information. Strategic, economic, financial, social and organisational questions are addressed in a range of committees attended by personnel and management representatives. 

  In accordance with French legal requirements enacted in 2019, various staff representative committees (the works council, health & safety committee and union representatives) were merged into a single body: The Social and Economic Committee ( Comité Social et Economique or CSE). 

  In addition to the Social and Economic Committee (CSE) in each branch, there are also the Group Committee and Central Social and Economic Committee (CSEC) in France, the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Commissions (CSSCT), and a variety of specialised joint commissions. 

  Pursuant to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and by virtue of the principles instituted in its Code of Ethics, the Group respects the freedom of labour unions and the rules of association in the countries where it operates. 

  In France, several agreements 40 were signed in 2019: ● Amendment No. 1 on the issue of an extraordinary 

  bonus for the 2018 financial year ● Collective agreement on maintaining the collective employee guarantees under the sale of CMA CGM

  ● Amendment No. 2, 3, 4 and 5 to the teleworking experiment within the Marseilles and Le Havre 

  facilities ● Amendment revising the facility agreement on the set-up of a working time clocking and checking system at the Marseilles facility of the CMA CGM economic

  CMA CGM economic and social unit (UES) ● Granting of extraordinary bonus_UES_13 

  December 2019 ● Agreement on maintaining the collective guarantees of CCLOG France and CMA CGM Logistics 

  Work organisation In France, since 2007, the inland office employees of the CMA CGM France economic and social unit (UES) have had an agreement on the 35-hour work week (French ARTT). In addition to the legally mandated 37 hours of effective working time, the “Convention on Days Worked” amendment to the ARTT agreement ensures flexibility for employees who are paid a flat rate. It also lays out tracking and organisation of workloads and the number of days worked. Generally, in all organisations, managers must ensure workloads are well distributed and that their teams are optimally organised.

  Teleworking In 2019, the teleworking experiment was opened up to new departments in the company. 

  Teleworking is an innovative way of organising work with such varied benefits as better work-life balance, improved working conditions for employees and greater independence in the accomplishment of their tasks. 

  To this end, several amendments renewed the teleworking arrangement throughout 2019, and it was opened up to new departments at the Marseilles and Le Havre sites. 

  Since 2018, 691 employees who met the eligibility criteria have teleworked for one day per week as mutually agreed between the employee and their manager. 

  To support them in this process, a guide has been drafted to answer all their questions. Teleworking applications are managed in the in-house application C-Park, which simultaneously reassigns the parking space of the teleworking employee. 

  For greater agility and to promote employee communication and mobility, the company has been transforming its tools for several years.

  Dedicated intranet: Galaxy In 2018 the CMA CGM Group rolled out its new 

  digital workplace: “Galaxy”. The purpose of this information platform is to: ● Improve communication and help all employees 

  discover the Group universe ● Break down information silos so that employees can 

  dialogue more easily ● Create communities to encourage a cooperative strategy 

  Galaxy was rolled out at the same time as a plethora of Office 365 tools and applications (OneDrive, Teams, Yammer, SharePoint, Forms, etc.). 

  To help employees adopt the new tools, the digital team created a Digital Adoption Centre run by a special team. Its purpose is to help employees with daily use of the tools, through training workshops, information pages, and a community of “Galaxy” ambassadors. 

  To encourage the emergence of ideas, a community of “Galaxy” ambassadors was formed. Passing on knowledge in-house, these 

  employees facilitate the transition to Galaxy and the Office 365 tools within their respective departments and networks. There are currently 144 Galaxy ambassadors in the Group. 

  In 2020, the company intends to expand this community and give its members a key role in the transformation of Group tools.

  Focus on CMA CGM applications 

  To support the company with the transformation of its tools and promote the emergence of more agile methods, the Group Digital Team has developed several applications to facilitate employees’ daily working lives: 

  C-Travel : to make business travel easier and safer. The application digitalises the TravelSafe Passport and the Group Travel Policy. Employees have very easy access to all information needed to manage their business trips, such as customs to follow in other countries, expense reimbursement, and the taxi policy. Once downloaded, the content is also available offline, and travellers can directly contact the Group’s emergency hotline at the touch of a button. 

  C-Park : optimises parking at the Jacques R. Saadé car park in Marseilles by reassigning available parking spaces when employees are absent. To do so, it is interfaced with the leave management software for visibility on available parking spaces. C-Park is also used to apply for teleworking. 

  C-Lunch : developed for the HR Department by the Digital Factory teams, this application makes it possible to create and sign up for business lunches. Employees may be invited to create and/or attend special events to build new relationships, expand their professional network, help new hires integrate, gain a better grasp of other business lines, or simply not lunch alone

  Work organisation for seafaring personnel 

  The work organisation for seafaring personnel complies with the international standards set by the Maritime Labour Convention 2006 which entered into force on 28 February 2013. The minimum rest time cannot be less than 10 hours per period of 24 hours and 77 hours per period of seven days. 

  The fleet management department adopted the rest time system, and monthly working hours are monitored both on board and on land to ensure our compliance. To ensure that seafaring personnel get enough rest and avoid fatigue, the Group initially set a monitoring threshold of 120 hours for the operating crew and 150 hours for ship stewards. In general, the Captain and the Chief Mechanic on board oversee that the Maritime Labour Convention standards are followed. 

  Maritime Labour Convention 

  The International Labour Organisation (ILO) met in 2006 to create a single document aggregating all the obligations concerning the working and living conditions on board vessels. The Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) was created, adopted and published, and became mandatory as of 2013. International maritime law now has four pillars: 

  - SOLAS for safety: International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea - MARPOL for the environment: International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships - STCW for training and certification: International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification 

  and Watch-keeping for Seafarers - MLC for social protection and working conditions – Maritime Labour Convention that sets the 

  minimum living and working conditions for all seafarers In August 2017, 84 members of the ILO ratified this convention, representing 89% of global shipping. 

  The MLC 2006 consists of five titles: 

  - Minimum requirements for seafarers to work on a ship - Conditions of employment - Accommodation, recreational facilities, food and catering - Health protection, medical care, welfare and social security protection - Compliance and enforcement 

  Due to the high quality of its vessels, CMA CGM was able to implement the MLC well before the 2013 deadline. 

  During the certification phase, no major shortcoming was found and whenever vessels are inspected, the Group demonstrates excellent working and living conditions on board its ships.

  Quality of life at the workplace and prevention of psycho-social risks 

  a. Quality of life at the workplace An action plan on Quality of Life at the Workplace has also been introduced, structured around optimising working processes and procedures and providing specific workshops on best practices for reducing psycho-social risks. 

  The plan continued in 2019 with the occupational psychologist. An e-learning session was created to train managers on quality of life at the workplace: identification of risk factors, support for employees in difficulty and stress management. 

  Efforts to improve quality of life at the workplace mainly relate to ensuring better follow-up of employees. For instance, a support process has been introduced to assist employees returning from long-term absences. Amongst other things, it includes various types of meetings organised between the human resources team, the manager and, if needed, the occupational psychologist. 

  Several steps have been taken to ensure a good work-life balance for employees. For example, a gender equality agreement 41 lays down 100% coverage of paternity leave for office-based and seafaring personnel; working time arrangements for pregnant women; the provision of 12 cribs within a private day-care centre to accommodate 18 children of employees; payment of an “early childhood allowance” through the Social and Economic committees; and the establishment of customised schedules for full- time employees (variable time slots) for all office-based institutions in Metropolitan France. 

  Barring any emergencies, travel must be planned in advance. Seafaring personnel must prepare ship departures well in advance so as to take into account family constraints expressed by employees. The working conditions are discussed at meetings of the Health and Safety Committees attended by Union and Management Representatives.

  Happy At Work 

  In 2019, to gain a better understanding of employee aspirations, stay agile and attentive to the quality of our in- house practices, we decided to sign on to the “Happy At Work” approach offered by “ChooseMyCompany”. 

  All employees within the France office scope were invited to answer an anonymous survey on professional development, a stimulating work environment, management, salary & recognition, pride of work, and pleasant work conditions. 

  Fully based on employee ratings, the Group received the “HappyIndex® / AtWork for Starters” label that recognises those organisations with the most motivated employees aged 29 or younger. 

  In 2020, we will renew our commitment to the “Happy at Work” approach and continue our overall reflection on quality of life at the workplace.

  As part of a collective approach, the “Wellness” pilot programme was launched in Marseilles. As the name implies, it focuses on four areas devoted to employee well-being: 

  Eat Well 

  This programme aims to improve nutritional balance by introducing organic food at the company cafeteria. 

  Various “Eat Well” initiatives include: - Offering balanced breakfasts - Setting up a station for organic vegetarian food at the company cafeteria - Organising thematic breakfasts with a dietician who advises employees on how to achieve a balanced 

  diet - Showing calories on the menu - Promoting the Sodexo application that provides the nutritional breakdown of dishes it sells 

  In parallel, the dining areas were renovated to offer employees a fresh experience, namely the Mini Market and the connected café, a functional, innovative and inviting area of 250 square meters.

  Move Well 

  To encourage employees to exercise, the Fitness centre was overhauled. 

  It is now a more pleasant, functional area, fitted with new machines that make it possible to do a 30- minute circuit to tone muscle and improve posture and balance. Employees can use the equipment alone or enjoy tips from a coach while exercising. 

  The Fitness courses offered have also been expanded to new disciplines like yoga, meditation, self- defence and TRX, and the facility is open for longer. 

  The eponymous “Move Well” app that was rolled out offers employees a new digital experience. At any moment they can sign up, reserve courses, see the schedule and pay online. 

  In 2020, new programmes on emotional balance (Feel Well) and sleep quality (Sleep Well) will also be developed and offered to employees.

  Company concierge service 

  The CMA CGM Group has set up a company concierge service at head office to help employees save time and generally make their life easier on a daily basis. 

  The “Conciergerie by CMA CGM” offers a wide range of services to employees such as: 

  - General services: dry cleaning, ironing, shoe repair, mending and tailoring, administrative procedures, 

  etc. - Home services: child minding, homework assistance, house cleaning, small home repairs, gardening, etc. 

  Delivery services: medication, flowers, take-away, etc. - Other services: shirts and ties, coffee capsules, stockings, etc. 

  - Every day, employees can consult with the concierge during opening hours. There is also a private connection for them to contact an around-the-clock call centre to book the services that they require. The services can be paid for online through a secure payment or via an e-wallet. 

  In 2019, 5,997 requests were handled by the concierge service. 

  Partnership with Hôpital Européen 

  To help employees benefit from accessible, quality healthcare, the CMA CGM Group has formed a partnership with the Hôpital Européen that is located near the CMA CGM Tower. 

  Employees benefit from preferential appointments for consultations and medical exams.

  Quality of life at the workplace for seafaring personnel 

  Our approach to this concern is both proactive and comprehensive: 

  It is proactive as it seeks to improve quality of life at the workplace as a whole and not simply to comply with the legal requirement to prevent psycho-social risks. It is comprehensive as it leverages social and organizational aspects at work and assists employees with their active approach to well-being. 

  The joint “Quality of Life at the Workplace” group has continued its work. Its role is to analyze the results of the social monitoring and Quality of Life at the Workplace surveys, while issuing recommendations. 

  The group continues its work on assignments undertaken in previous years: ship ergonomics, the land-sea relationship, working quality of life on board, simplification of on-board administrative processes, and analysis of accidents with fault tree analyses in conjunction with the victims of these accidents. 

  The CCP group has set up specific training for the Quality of Life at the Workplace officers on board the vessels. The training was tailored and then transferred to the Maritime Prevention Institute for certification approval before being extended to all shipping companies. 

  The Quality of Life at the Workplace officers on board vessels will be provided with awareness-raising tools to conduct their prevention actions. The CCP group will act as a “back-up” support for these individuals. 

  A partnership with Human Fab (formerly ESP Consulting), an expert sports and performance centre, has been set up to optimise the health and physical performance of seafaring personnel and reduce the rate of accidents. 

  Human Fab set up a pilot group on board a vessel for three months to perform its mission, become known to the seafaring personnel and gather ideas for future improvement from them. The outcome showed a 40% improvement in physical condition for all assessed criteria. CMA CGM wants to bolster its Quality of Life at the Workplace actions by incorporating topics like sleep and emotional management for seafaring staff. 

  Other areas for improvement: 

  On-board catering. Freely chosen, direct provisioning without going through a ship chandler yielded satisfactory results in terms of food quality and overhead costs, so was extended to all ships. Standardisation of fitness rooms so that all seafarers can exercise. 

  New actions have been conducted to promote and raise crew awareness of Quality of Life at the Workplace, good managerial practices, and addiction prevention.

  b. Psycho-social risks The Group’s policy on psycho-social risks is covered by an agreement signed on 20 May 2010 (agreement on preventing psycho-social risks among employees of the CMA CGM economic and social unit). The document provides milestones for a preventive programme to measure, analyse and monitor psycho-social risks. Recommended actions include: 

  ● Preventing mental or sexual harassment and 

  instituting a reporting procedure ● Organising manager training courses on psycho-social risk prevention

  Since the agreement was signed, a psychological support unit has been set up. The unit is available by telephone or online 24/7 and is a completely confidential space for employees to talk to someone of their choice. In addition to preventing psycho-social risks, it embodies the Group’s sustained promise to improve life in the workplace for its employees. Several long-term projects have been launched at both the individual and collective levels. The priority areas to work on are work environment, social climate and employee support. 

  As part of the 2018 action plan, the Group commissioned an external training organisation to continue providing training to managers regarding good managerial practices.

  3. Talent development

  Career management 

  Thierry Billion Chief Operating Officer, CMA CGM Group 

  "Our employees are our most precious asset. Therefore we invest constantly in developing their skills".

  The Group continues to develop career management, by transforming its HR tools, amongst other things. 

  C&Me “Talent Management” module offers a new approach to talent management and better HR support, from succession plans, talent identification and assessments to optimisation and forecasting of organisations by activity. 

  Within this context, the Group has implemented a “High Potential” identification process. This international review of individuals identified as “High Potential” is used to determine key positions and plan for succession. 

  Furthermore, the Group encourages initiatives from all employees seeking to embark upon new challenges. To this end, the Performance Interview allows office-based employees and their line managers to take stock of their objectives, measure their performance, form new career development goals and express their training needs. 

  In 2020, a new Performance Interview format will be offered in France and several pilot countries outside France. It will feature interview timing that matches our activity, a simplified format, constructive feedback that gets to the heart of business, and individual development plans. 

  Mobility puts skills where they are needed within the Group. In addition to conventional types of mobility, such as expatriation, local contracts and secondment, the Group’s mobility policy offers several innovative career paths. As a result, employees are better able to expand their range of skills, hone their expertise or achieve managerial positions.

  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 109

  


**************************** Page 110****************************

  The Group HR Department 

  rolled out this pilot project in 2019 in Marseilles. Its purpose is to provide employees with better assistance with their mobility projects, meet their needs for information on the Group’s businesses, and provide optimal support throughout their career. 

  The comprehensive HR tool is designed to give employees: 

  ● Une Greater visibility of the Group’s businesses ● A broader view of cross-skilling or potential job 

  transfers between business lines ● A dedicated area and specific times to discuss with key 

  business players, form ties and foster opportunities ● Tools to help them prepare their development plan 

  The first event of the C-Careers pilot brought together over 200 employees for a conference on “Discovering jobs at the Commercial Agency Network (CAN)”, followed by discussions with field workers. 

  Several other events made it possible to discover CAN jobs in even greater depth: 

  ● Cafés Témoignages, combined discussions and coffee breaks for employees to gain inspiration from the career path of spokespeople representing various 

  jobs. ● Group and individual HR support workshops to help employees succeed with their mobility goals (building a mobility project, writing a CV, preparing for 

  interviews and preparing a pitch). ● Themed lunches organised in C-Lunch are also planned, where experts are invited to help employees discover a given job and discuss mobility possibilities.

  The innovative Junior Upwards Mobility Programme (JUMP) gives our young talents a chance to work abroad for six months to discover new jobs and a different working environment. Every year, some twenty employees take part in this international mobility programme. 

  “SWAP” is another option whereby two employees from different entities trade jobs. 

  The VIE programme ( Volontariat International en Entreprise, a French internship programme) sends young graduates to our organisations in other countries to expand their knowledge, acquire new interpersonal skills and help standardise practices and procedures within the Group. At the end of their contracts, we offer them career opportunities and a chance to take on new challenges to help the Group grow. In 2019, 30 VIE participants were stationed primarily in Africa, Asia, and North and South America. 

  Finally, every year, the Group offers employees expatriation contracts in a number of different countries. In addition to sharing best practices and standardising working methods, international mobility gives employees exposure to more responsibility and the chance to widen their range of skills. 

  Employees are kept informed of international mobility throughout the year through discussions, conferences and targeted communications.

**************************** Page 111****************************

  Various programmes are set up to attract, retain and develop the talents within the Group: ● Le The Sponsorship programme helps executives 

  integrate the company faster and more smoothly. ● Mentoring is also available to help employees settle 

  into a new job. ● Coaching and E-coaching facilitate the development of 

  soft skills as well as international mobility. ● 360° Feedback 

  In 2019, the emphasis will be on developing Mentoring within the company and in Asia. A panel of managers will be invited to take part in an information session on Mentoring that will be coordinated by the Group Human Resources Department. At the end of this session, a selection of managers who have volunteered to take part in the programme will receive a half-day of training on the role and responsibilities of a Mentor. To support them, a mentor discussion group has been created. 

  These programmes are based on establishing close relationships, trust and mutual respect, and allow experienced employees to share their knowledge of the Group, network and experience. 

  In 2020, the programme will be more broadly rolled out in other countries. 

  360° Feedback Since 2018, the Group has been actively developing an overall corporate culture of feedback. 360° feedback is an individual development tool: 

  ● Comparing self-perception (self-assessment) and colleagues’ perception identifies strengths and areas for improvement that a participant might not know 

  otherwise. ● An individual development plan is then constructed around concrete actions.

  The pilot project was launched with some of the Corporate Officers in Marseilles so that, in turn, they can become drivers of the feedback culture within their organisation. 

  In 2019, 360° feedback continued to be developed and the HR team was trained in use of the debriefing tool. In becoming thoroughly acquainted with the 360° debriefing tool, the HR teams can support development plans and foster growth of the corporate feedback culture. 

  School for General Managers (GM) 

  In 2019, the Group Human Resources Department launched a development programme specifically for general managers at our international sites, in conjunction with the CMA CGM Academy and the Commercial Agency Network (CAN). 

  The pilot programme aims to develop their understanding of Group strategy and corporate culture, in addition to supporting their individual needs in terms of professional development. 

  The career development route will include various steps: identifying individual development needs with 360° feedback, online micro-training and a four-day training programme at the head office in Marseilles. GMs will also benefit from peer mentoring and individual coaching. 

  The pilot programme is slated to be launched in 2020 with a selection of 25 GMs.

  Managing the careers of seafaring personnel 

  The individual in charge of fleet management regularly monitors the careers of seafaring personnel. A briefing is held at each embarkation to check that everyone’s certificates are valid and that seafarers have attended all mandatory training sessions. 

  The Group offers inland career development opportunities, such as temporary missions to bolster skills and give seafarers the possibility of a “land-sea” career. 

  On 31 December 2019, payroll amounted to

  A competitive wage policy USD 4,063 million.

  In order to attract, retain and motivate talent, CMA CGM relies on a wage policy with three priorities: 

  ● Equality within the company ● External competitiveness ● Performance-based remuneration 

  Since July 2016, when the APL teams were integrated, the CMA CGM Group has undertaken a comprehensive endeavour to harmonise salaries and health insurance, welfare and pension schemes, in approximately 40 countries. This involved comparative studies of both amounts (e.g. of salaries and social benefits) and structures in the countries under examination. As a follow-up, an audit was initiated in late 2017 for all Group companies. In 2018, the audit report provided an exhaustive assessment of the Group’s supplementary health care, welfare and pension schemes. 

  Health insurance and welfare scheme harmonisation continued in 2018 and led to the signature of an umbrella policy with an international broker on 1 December 2018. The broker’s scope will initially extend to 55 countries for which it will negotiate the policies or policy renewals for the Group (life insurance / permanent disability and health care). 

  The CMA CGM Group is thereby demonstrating its desire to align the health and welfare coverage of Group employees with market practices (in the same industry), while taking into account unique local and regional characteristics.

  personnel ● An increase in training hours for French office-based personnel due to launch of the “Leadership” offer. 

  CMA CMA CGM Academy helps all employees on a daily basis in all their job-related activities and offers a wide range of e-learning or classroom-based courses with an instructor to meet everyone’s needs. CMA CGM Academy supports Group strategy via strategic actions such as bolstering human expertise combined with agile organisation.

  For seafaring personnel, 2019 was a year of refocusing on training fundamentals. It should be noted that 17,009 hours of classroom-based “Mentoring” training sessions should be added to the total training hours for seafaring personnel, for an aggregate 93,474 hours. 

  In 2019, CMA CGM Academy rolled out a training programme for captains: The Master Management Program. It was created to improve management methods of our international Senior Officers on board Group vessels.

  Dans LNG training programme 

  In preparation for the future integration of LNG Dual Fuel vessels into our fleet, in accordance with new environmental regulations, the Academy has created a complete training programme to meet the needs of both seafaring and office-based personnel. Part of the programme deals with regulations, while the other has been customised to deal specifically with our vessels. The goal is to develop everyone’s skills on the topics and ensure that new technologies are used more safely.

  Leadership offer To help employees hone their soft skills, CMA CGM Academy has rolled out its Leadership programme. The innovative training sessions call on both in-house and external trainers to address such topics as stress management, communication, conflict management and feedback. To ensure optimum implementation of the various LISA training modules (such as LISA Procurement, Intermodal, Sales Target, Cargo Flow, Customer Allocation, etc.), CMA CGM Academy has put together a network of “Super Key Users” and “Key Users” who are trained and guided by the CMA CGM Academy. In parallel, specific training for international HR staff has also been delivered to provide support on data entry in C&Me. 

  The “Negotiation Advanced” programme was also rolled out by the Academy to help Group buyers develop their negotiating skills. 

  In 2019, CMA CGM Academy developed innovative new job-specific courses at head office and the regional offices. The courses are designed to meet the training needs of each population. 

  For example, the “Port Operation” course was designed for the operating professions at the agencies, while the “Fuel Management Basics” course is intended for operations staff head office, CMA Ships Superintendents and the Bunkering and Chartering departments.

  Certificate training programmes 

  In 2019, the CMA CGM Academy also developed certificate training programmes for France. These comprehensive professional development programmes enhance employability, since employees’ skills are showcased and officially recognised by the certification imparted. 

  To illustrate, some of the training courses on offer that culminate in a certificate include two modules of Kedge’s Programme Grande Ecole and the “Procurement” course that corresponds to four modules of Kedge’s master in international procurement.

  The Lab: devoted to innovation and transformation 

  In 2019, the CMA CGM Academy proposed innovative workshops to the Lab, such as joint development for employees that have taken the management course. This method enables employees to improve their professional practices through the experience of others. Other workshops on design thinking and digital innovations also gave Group employees the chance to work on cutting-edge approaches to address new issues facing the Group.

  Fostering creative cooperation with Thecamp 

  Thecamp is a campus for innovation and networking focusing on the city of tomorrow and the digital transformation. 

  Throughout the year, CMA CGM encourages employees to go there for workshops such as Leadership of the 21 st century, or to seek out inspiration and design, anticipate and build a desirable future, with the help of new technologies. 

  Training for seafaring personnel: Training for seafaring personnel revolves around STCW 2010 (the international convention that sets forth certification standards for each maritime profession). Some of these certificates are renewed every 5 years after refresher training. Additional training courses are required by CMA Ships and offered to seafaring personnel to boost their skills.

  

  An efficient information system The Human Resources information system, C&Me, has been helping standardise HR processes around the world. The tool offers greater visibility of all HR programmes (mobility, development, training) and fosters more efficient, detailed HR management, including by managing objectives and skills. Lastly, it encourages employees to be more proactive in furthering their careers. 

  All the HR processes have been reviewed through C&Me, making them simpler, more standardised and leaner and thereby more in line with the key issues at stake for the Group. The HR teams and managers have all the latitude they need to manage team resources: 

  ● “Talent Acquisition”, for recruitment and internal 

  mobility; ● “Talent Management”, a career management tool; ● “Talent Performance” to measure and encourage 

  employee development; ● “On Boarding”, dedicated to the integration of new 

  employees; ● “Work Force Analytics”, a reporting tool that offers each HR BP summarised information and key indicators for their scope. 

  Since 2018, the new C&Me interface has provided a better user experience for Group employees (simplified design, more intuitive interface, compatibility with mobile terminals, etc.). In 2020, the mobile version of C&Me will become available for Group employees. 

  In 2019, the Group’s external recruitment portal was also entirely redesigned with a new look and new graphics for an enhanced user experience (clearer view of openings at the Group, compatibility with mobile telephones, etc.).

  all year • 147 trainees and apprentices recruited • 50% trainee-to-employee transformation rate (only graduating 

  second-year master’s degree students) • 45% female and 55% male trainees • 32% of recruitment realised through 

  academic endeavours • 21 nationalities represented by our trainees

  CMA CGM presents its business lines at Usine Extraordinaire 

  CMA CGM attended the second edition of Usine Extraordinaire from 14 to 16 November 2019 in Marseilles. The event showcases the size and potential of French industry and drew more than 20,000 visitors and 10,000 apprentices and students to its 5,000 square meters of exhibits by major companies of southern France. HR department representatives presented CMA CGM businesses and past or current changes to them, particularly from an environmental standpoint. 

  Through CMA CGM’s partnership with the Académie d’Aix-Marseille, middle and secondary school students can discover the universe of maritime transport and gain a better understanding of globalisation. 

  It is essential to understand maritime transport for a firm grasp of international trade and the functioning of the global economy. 

  Under the partnership signed between CMA CGM and the Académie d'Aix-Marseille school board, students from middle schools within the board’s jurisdiction are welcomed at the head office to discover the CMA CGM Group and the shipping industry’s role in world commerce. Some 1,200 students visited in 2019.

  General Policy 

  Employee health and safety is a major priority for the Group. Some activities and jobs carry significant risks, particularly on-board vessels, as well as at terminals and warehouses. 

  The CMA CGM Group’s health and safety policy is designed to avoid any accident which may result in injuries or the loss of human life to employees at sea or on land, or major damage to the vessels, cargo or the environment. This is achieved by establishing an Integrated Management System (IMS), a set of procedures which are periodically assessed and revised. These procedures are common to all vessels managed by CMA Ships, regardless of its flag.

  Further to this, a Group Terminals and Inland QHSSE policy has been developed covering all inland terminals and sites, with the implementation of common standards formalised through the QHSSE Guidelines. This approach is centred on the "top 10 critical risks”.

  Terminals & Inland Networking Analysis: 

  In 2019, to meet the challenges linked to the expansion of the port terminal portfolio (managed by the Group) and the extension of the scope to inland warehouses, the Terminals & Inland QHSSE division launched the Tin@ digital solution. The app makes it possible to report any incident, near-miss or dangerous situation from a smartphone or tablet. This form of instant communication improves response time and removes red tape that can slow down decision-making and preventative action, for example. The app provides an overall view of all QHSSE events as they unfold as well as the performance of each site. The solution is part of the " paperless" policy implemented at many sites. 

  In 2020 the app is slated for deployment at all 61 Terminals and inland sites subject to the Corporate Terminals and Inland QHSSE policy. 

  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 122

  


**************************** Page 123****************************

  A dedicated organisation, the SSE department (Security, Safety, Environment), both analyses and prevents risks, and inspects and implements technical and organisational procedures in accordance with regulations in force. Every

  year, the department audits the vessels and other Group assets, to verify that the CMA CGM health and safety policy is properly applied. It also coordinates operations in the event of a major crisis.

  Certifications

  53% of the Terminals subject to the CMA CGM HO Terminals QHSSE policy 48 are ISO 9001-, ISO 14001- and/or OHSAS 18001-certified. As part of the ongoing improvement process for terminals’ QHSSE performance 49 , the close of 2019 saw 17 certifications obtained and maintained.

  CMA Ships has obtained complementary triple certification for its entire scope 47 : 

  ● ISO 9001 Quality and Customer Satisfaction ● OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and Safety ● ISO 14001 Environmental Protection 

  Maritime safety Maritime safety is governed by stringent local and international regulations, mostly determined at an international level via the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), but also at regional and local level. These laws and regulations are complex and subject to frequent change. The Group’s compliance is routinely evaluated through a series of external audits by authorities, the port of call country and classification societies, as well as through internal inspections and audits. Accordingly, each vessel is subject to three-fold regulations, each with its own specific inspections: 

  ● International regulations (MARPOL, SOLAS, IMS 

  Code, etc.) ● Regulations of the ship’s flag state. The CMA CGM owned fleet sails under 12 different flags, primarily 

  from the European Union and Singapore ● Local or regional regulations 

  As a means of checking the seaworthiness of the vessels, port of call countries carry out regular inspections on board the ships, known as Port State Control (PSC). If a regulatory, mechanical, procedural or organisational 

  47 CMA Ships scope excluding Mercosul Line and AML 48 Scope of the Terminals subject to the CMA CGM HO QHSSE Terminals policy – List available in the methodological note

  problem is detected, and involves the safety of people, the ship or the environment, a deficiency is recorded. If the deficiencies noted are serious enough to call into question the seaworthiness of the vessel, it will be detained by port authorities until the necessary modifications are carried out to restore the vessel to a proper condition. 

  So as to be proactive and promote the CMA CGM Group's health and safety policy, as well as IMS procedures, PSCs are regularly performed by teams from the SSE department. In 2019, PSCs were performed in China (MSA), Russia and Australia (AMSA). In addition to this, joint PSCs between CMA CGM and the flag state were performed on board vessels to pool inspection methods. 

  During 2019, the owned fleet’s rate of deficiencies per PSC (Port State Control) was 0.99, compared to 0.91 deficiencies per PSC in 2018.

  A proven crisis management plan 

  Although CMA CGM safety management procedures are mainly preventive, the Group also has a comprehensive plan for managing crisis situations. The plan contains responses to emergency situations on board ships as well as at branches and terminals. The plan is tested at least once per year and regular training sessions are delivered to improve the response capabilities of the crisis management teams. In addition, the Group carries out regular drills in conjunction with the authorities to prepare for potentially dangerous events, such as pirate attacks, emergency towing, fire and oil spills. 

  In the event of a crisis, the affected entity first calls the 24/7 emergency hotline where it is put in touch with the person on duty. This person informs the various departments of the situation, and based on the severity of the event, decides to form a crisis team bringing together all the relevant parties. There is a dedicated room for this purpose in Marseilles and Singapore with all the necessary means of communication. Any crisis is therefore managed from this room. Once the crisis has been resolved, an investigation is carried out to determine the underlying causes and learn from them in order to avoid recurrence of the same event.

  Fleet Navigation Centre: state-of-the-art technological resources 

  Modern technological resources are developed in-house by the expert captains of Fleet Centres in order to mitigate navigation-related risks, such as those related to the weather. These resources are then provided to captains and officers on board Group vessels and include navigation aid systems or decision-making systems for navigation during bad weather. At the Navigation control centres located in Marseilles, Singapore and Miami, experienced ship captains constantly track the routes, analyse risks and advise and support the fleet vessels as well as the Group’s operational staff. 

  The navigation centres are also tasked with ensuring optimum ship piloting in terms of fuel consumption, compliance with ship speeds in whale breeding habitats and compliance with regulated navigation areas. To this end, experts at the centres have developed innovative piloting methods and methods for the kinematic monitoring of vessels coupled with powerful analysis tools that take into account geography, weather and marine currents in real time, as well as piracy risks. This year, a new tool was developed to anticipate delays and congestion in order to reduce speed as soon as possible and cut waiting time at ports. It is an innovative way to achieve a smaller carbon footprint. 

  In partnership with the Reefer Department, the Fleet Centres have become GDP-compliant (referring to Good Distribution Practices for pharmaceutical products) and now monitor highly sensitive reefers in real time, such as Aquaviva, Pharmaceuticals & Superfreezer. 

  A team of ship captains with expertise in vessel operation study and set the rules for nautical access to all ports at which the group calls. Given the introduction of new ships into the fleet, as well as the constant changes being made to ports and terminals, a group of experts is needed with experience in the operation of large vessels, to study navigation-related risks and to pro-actively set rules for port access. In essence, this involves adjusting cargo capacity in order to guarantee economic profitability while constantly safeguarding vessels, crews and the port environment. The rules of access therefore concern the ship’s measurements (length, beam and draught), the needed support resources (such as tugboats) and the acceptable hydrometeorological conditions (tides, currents, wind). To this same end, feedback is collected to provide successive ship captains with the most up-to-date and relevant information possible.

  Search and rescue 

  As the oceans are so vast, shipping industry players have to work together to rescue individuals in danger. At any time, ships may have to be diverted to assist another ship in distress. These operations are known as Search & Rescue (SAR) operations. In 2019, five such operations were carried out by vessels in the owned fleet. 

  Stowaways 

  Measures have been put in place on board ships to prevent stowaways from boarding, to regularly look for stowaways, and if applicable, to manage any stowaways found on board. These procedures have been included in the Ship Security Plan (SSP), which is set by the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS). 

  The ship’s SSP is a confidential document. In 2019, 13 stowaways were found on board vessels.

  Occupational health and safety The Group’s approach to risk prevention revolves around the assessment of risks relating to health & safety and working conditions. This is a process of ongoing improvement whereby all players, from General Management to seafaring and operational staff, are involved on a day-to-day basis. 

  The owned fleet sails under various state flags in international waters, with seafarers from different cultures and nationalities. As a result, standardising procedures and practices within our fleet has become a major issue. With this in mind, the Accident Prevention Committee (APC) was created. It meets regularly to review health and safety outcomes, regulatory changes, feedback from vessels and innovations which may improve safety on board vessels.

  At the various maritime, inland and office-based entities, all risks are identified and assessed in accordance with applicable regulations, and then covered in annual prevention plans. The prevention plans address various themes such as personal protection equipment, chemical risks, psychosocial risks, addictions and noise exposure. 

  The main health and safety risks to employees differ based on business activities:

  Shipping activities Terminal activities

   Fire / explosion  Falls from height or tripping and falling  Stevedoring risks  Exposure to chemicals  Psychosocial risks  Movement and posture  Noise / Vibration

   Collisions  Fire / explosion  Falls from height  Stevedoring  Energy  Falling objects/cargo  Vibrations

  Every quarter, feedback on events that occurred on board (accidents, near misses and inspections) is compiled and discussed among the owned fleets. This gives seafarers the opportunity to draw from each other’s experiences and puts them in a better position to anticipate risks. 

  Training and awareness campaigns are crucial components of prevention. They include compulsory job-related training courses; awareness sessions on land, on board or at work stations; distance learning for seafaring staff; special training courses for all second officers; regular drills; and navigation simulators. Seminars are held at the head office and attended by officers from all the Group’s fleets. Attendees discuss a range of operational and on-board safety topics, such as analysis of reported events and safety management.

  Furthermore, the Group is an active member of the Container Ship Safety Forum (CSSF). Founded in 2014, this non-governmental organisation brings together major shipping players with the aim of improving safety performance and container shipping management practices. 

  Terminals Seminar

  With regards to terminal activities, CMA Terminals, a subsidiary of the CMA CGM Group, is a member of the International Cargo Handling Coordination Association (ICHCA). This independent non-profit organisation dedicated to improving the safety, security, sustainability, productivity and efficiency of cargo handling and transport by all modes and at all stages of national and international supply chains.

  The Quality, Health, Security, Safety and Environment (QHSSE) department welcomed representatives from 18 terminals for two days at our head office, for an annual seminar on health and safety issues. The seminar was an opportunity to take stock of the past year, give QHSSE recommendations for 2019, and above all share experiences. 

  Each terminal (Malta, Casablanca, Kingston, Montoir, Rotterdam, Le Havre, Pointe-à-Pître, Fort-de-France, Dégrad des Cannes, Natal, Kaohsiung and Seville) presented the health and safety initiatives it had undertaken, with each presentation rated by the participants. 

  At the end of the seminar, Olivier Texier, Deputy Central Director of Health, Safety & Security, Boris Wenzel, Managing Director at Terminal Link and Cédric Rousseau, QHSSE Terminals and Inland Division Manager, presented awards for the three best initiatives, namely Pointe-à-Pître (first prize), Montoir (second prize) and Kingston (third prize).

  The frequency of industrial accidents with sick leave at terminals managed by the Group has decreased over the last five years due to an effective prevention policy over the entire scope. Between 2018 and 2019, the average frequency of industrial accidents with sick leave has not changed, in the knowledge that we have expanded the scope over the past 2 years.

  The frequency of accidents in the maritime scope increased year-on-year in 2019, with a rate of 1.88 this year against 1.25 in 2018. The severity set in 2018 has not changed. The frequency of recorded accidents increased in 2019 but their overall severity decreased for a larger number of vessels year-on-year. They primarily involved young and/or inexperienced seafarers, a demographic that is increasing at a rate matching that of fleet growth and which unfortunately lacks maturity in terms of safety culture. The main challenge for 2020 is to work on this angle to reduce the number of accidents. 

  Accidents on board vessels involving seafaring staff are not the only ones counted by the Company. Accidents affecting shore-based staff working on board are also tracked, reported and analysed. 

  Industrial accidents with leave of more than 24 hours and/or those near misses considered very serious are routinely investigated to analyse the causes and introduce appropriate corrective and preventive actions. 

  52 2018 and 2019 scope: Terminals subject to the CMA CGM HO SSE Terminals policy – List available in the methodological note 53 2018 and 2019 scope: Including Mercosul Line // 2018 and 2019 data concerning the frequency and severity of industrial accidents with sick leave are not comparable, due to a change in methodology in the calculation of number of hours worked. In 2018, the hours worked were calculated from the exact number of

  sailors on board. In 2019, the hours worked were estimated from the average number of sailors on board. 54 Of the six people who died in 2018, reported as major maritime events, none of them falls within the scope of fatal accidents: two non-crew seafarers, three heart attacks and one suicide. No fatal accidents were recorded in 2019.

**************************** Page 131****************************

  Near misses 

  A near miss (or dangerous situation) is a sequence of events and/or circumstances which could have caused damage or harm. Near misses must be studied and recorded, and experiences shared, to reduce the probability of similar incidents occurring. Most industrial accidents are preceded by near misses which should have served as a warning. In 2019, CMA CGM recorded 2,134 near misses, a marginally higher number than those recorded in 2018 (1,950). 

  Asbestos risk 

  CMA CGM is continuing its actions to manage risk from the asbestos found on ships, in compliance with French and international regulations. 

  Led by the ad hoc committee, many actions have been taken so far by the companies. In addition to seafarer training, asbestos has been identified on board ships and, where needed, removed or abated. Measures have been taken to control asbestos dust levels in the air. Crews have been provided with operating procedures, personal and team protective equipment in the event they must work on asbestos- containing materials. Materials and equipment supplied are controlled in the course of construction, routine maintenance and technical shut-down of ships. Finally, asbestos actions are communicated to the maritime authorities, administration, maritime occupational health and safety board and trade unions.

  Cargo Security The CMA CGM Group transports a wide variety of cargo, ranging from general cargo and manufactured goods to consumer products and dangerous goods. Some cargo can represent a danger during transport, so the Group has set up a dedicated organisation to inspect, analyse and prevent risks related to the carriage of goods. For this purpose, the Group divides goods into three categories: ● Goods qualified as dangerous by international regulations (e.g. the International Maritime Dangerous Goods code or IMDG) or national laws (CFR49 – Code of Federal Regulations) that impose

  poorly declared cargo, and goods shipped in reefers or flexitanks. With regards to these, the Group has provided its in-house customers with three experts who are tasked with providing safety advice to the lines and agencies. These three experts are also responsible for advising the lines, the agencies and the dangerous goods offices on goods subject to restricted movement. Finally, the CMA CGM Group uses its best endeavours to prevent unlawful carriage of goods in accordance with regulations and the Group’s Code of Ethics. This mainly relates to goods on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, those covered

  strict regulations transport (packaging, by Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of

  

  segregation, temperature, stowing, etc.) ● Potentially dangerous goods that require recommendations: chemicals in reefers, loading and 

  acceptance of heavy lift items, etc. ● Controlled goods subject to regulations preventing or limiting their movement (e.g. waste, protected species, etc.). 

  To manage dangerous goods, the Group has a dedicated computer application connected to the overall computer booking system. The application electronically incorporates international regulation, thus making it possible to control the way dangerous goods are declared then packaged and stowed in the container. 

  Potentially dangerous goods are those which may represent a risk, such as out-of-gauge, break-bulk, or

  Endangered Species (CITES, also known as the Washington Convention), the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, and various UN rules on embargoed goods. 

  Faced with a resurgence in container fires throughout the container shipping industry, particularly in the last two years, the Group has decided to set two major priorities to eradicate these accidents, in close collaboration with other shipping companies and our main insurers. Our first priority is to improve our computer tool designed to search for false declarations of goods, particularly those likely to cause a fire, and to set up an organization capable of processing this data in real time. In the short term, shipping companies will exchange key terms via the CINS to help identify false declarations or even use a shared false declaration detection system.

  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 132

  


**************************** Page 133****************************

  The second priority is to improve the safety of ship-loading plans by taking into account the risks specific to each dangerous item, the fire response capabilities of ships and the need to limit the spread of any fire incident on board. In November 2019, CINS published a basic document aimed at improving the stowage of dangerous containers on board ships.

  Active involvement by CMA CGM within CINS 

  The Group is a founding member of the Cargo Incident Notification System (CINS), an information-sharing platform for large maritime companies (70% of loaded TEUs) that enables rapid notification regarding security and safety issues of container-transported goods. 

  The system has already significantly improved the quality of container cargo transport. 

  To fight against false declarations, the 17 CINS member companies moved to set up a joint system to detect poorly-declared loads in order to improve the overall safety of container ships.

  CMA CGM actively involved with BASCAP 

  The Group works closely with organisations known for fighting counterfeiting and arms trafficking, such as BASCAP (Business Actions to Stop Counterfeiting & Piracy).

  International Security 

  At sea With the aim of preventing and dealing with threats at sea, CMA CGM has developed a comprehensive range of operational, legal and human measures. These measures are constantly reassessed and tailored to the changing security context (piracy, trafficking, etc.). The risk of piracy is therefore continuously monitored and analysed, and each solution is tailored to appropriately respond to identified piracy hotspots (West Africa, Indian Ocean, South-East Asia, etc.). In 2019, approximately 178 piracy events were recorded worldwide, of which 144 were confirmed pirate attacks. Of these 178 attacks, most took place in West Africa. More than a hundred incidents involving piracy were recorded in the Gulf of Guinea in 2019, almost doubling in the space of a year. There has been an increase in both the number of kidnappings and the degree of violence used by the kidnappers. Eight CMA CGM Group ships faced piracy events over the past year, although none of the Group's ships were hijacked. 

  On land For several years, CMA CGM has developed a comprehensive land safety policy. Through relevant and appropriate protection measures and means, this policy aims to reduce the exposure to security, health, natural and technological risks of the Group's activities and personnel, across the globe. CMA CGM thus seeks to guarantee everyone an optimal level of protection.

  For example, countries around the world are classified into different levels of criticality, depending on the risks identified in each of them. For each country, appropriate measures are thus put in place, both for the security of Group companies and for the protection of employees, whether they are local, expatriate or traveling. Within the Group, 85 countries are classified at risk. Any traveller going to these countries must first be registered with the Group Security Department, and briefed if necessary. In 2019, more than 1,000 trips to high-risk countries were changed. The Group had to deal with more than 101 situations directly impacting its activities and / or its personnel (vs. 84 direct impacts in 2018), for some of the implementation of an ad hoc crisis unit. While these situations were multifaceted, such as natural disasters, armed conflicts, threats against certain employees or even emergency medical evacuations, it should be noted that 2019 was particularly presented by a significant increase in problems. climatic and social (major social conflicts in particular in Lebanon, Iraq, Chile, Bolivia, Hong Kong, etc.).

  Active involvement by CMA CGM within CINDEX 

  The CINDEX (inter-company centre for expatriation) is a place for dialogue and sharing best practices on international mobility strategies and policies by a network of major European groups. Each member benefits from the experience of others, while maintaining full freedom of action and decisions, and observing absolute confidentiality. 

  It is an informal network of peers grounded in pooled knowledge and trust. The fact that CINDEX co-opts its members makes for a community with genuinely shared concerns.

  1. CMA CGM Foundation 

  Through the Foundation, set up in 2005 by Naïla Saadé, who was Chair from 2005 to 

  2019, the CMA CGM Group has demonstrated its commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility. The CMA CGM Foundation has supported more than 250 not-for-profit organisations providing assistance to children, since it was created. Through the Containers of Hope initiative, it facilitates humanitarian aid operations to the most vulnerable children worldwide. 

  In June 2019, when Tanya Saadé Zeenny became Chair of the Foundation, she decided to give new impetus to the Foundation, by renewing and extending its historical remit to include a new core theme, education for all. 

  Tanya Saadé Zeenny CMA CGM Group Deputy CEO

  "Education is the key to equal opportunity. This is why the CMA CGM Foundation focuses on education for all. We support not-for-profit organisations that help children and young people to find their place in tomorrow’s world."

  Containers of Hope In 2019, the Foundation continued to provide humanitarian aid through the Containers of Hope programme. The programme assists non-governmental organisations by providing maritime transport. The CMA CGM Group ships approximately 300 TEU containers of aid a year to people in conflict zones and areas exposed to health and humanitarian risks. Launched in October 2012 to assist Action against Hunger and Doctors without Borders, the support was extended in 2014 to include the French Red Cross and other NGOs requiring assistance. 

  Since the start of the campaign at the end of 2019, 980 containers carrying 7,500 tonnes of humanitarian supplies have been transported to partner NGO programmes in thirty-eight different countries, primarily in Africa. The supplies have helped to combat child malnutrition, improve access to water and satisfy the healthcare needs of the most vulnerable populations, particularly children.

The award recognises the not-for- profit organisation’s work in helping talented children aged between 12 and 18 from educational priority areas to gain the knowledge and skills required to access the most prestigious higher education courses. 

  In Lebanon, the 2019 Foundation Award was presented to the not-for-profit organisation Paradis d’Enfants on 23 December at a ceremony at CMA CGM’s head office in Beirut. Paradis d’enfants manages three primary schools for disadvantaged children in Lebanon. It promotes access to high quality education for all children regardless of their origin.

  Marseilles tragedy Rue d’Aubagne 

  Saddened by the tragic collapse of homes in rue d’Aubagne in Marseille in 2018, the CMA CGM Group’s foundation provided solidarity to the victims and those who lost their 

  homes. In 2019, for the second time, it donated €10,000 to the Provence Alpes Côte d’Azur section of the Abbé Pierre Foundation which takes long term action to improve housing conditions for disadvantaged people. 

  Employee commitment Mentoring programme In 2019, the Foundation continued the programme launched in 2018 and enabled 35 employees to participate in mentoring . 25 employees in Marseilles and 10 in Le Havre invested three working days to nine not- for-profit organisations, six in Marseilles and three in Le Havre:

The not-for-profit organisation Les Nids provides support to children and families through initiatives to protect, support, educate and enhance the understanding of children and young people to give them a better chance of building a future

  Partnership with the Institut Télémaque 

  In the same way that it supports employee commitment , the CMA CGM Foundation continued its partnership with the Institut Télémaque . The not-for-profit organisation works to promote equal opportunities to education for children from age 12 upwards by mentoring motivated and merit-worthy young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Each young person has a mentor in a company, and a representative in school. The objective is to develop cultural and social awareness, a basic understanding of the professional world and educational perseverance and self-confidence. Through the partnership, six Group employees volunteer their free time to mentor a young person over a one-year period, renewable. The mentor helps the mentee to develop and to gain awareness of the professional and cultural world by providing the opportunities they deserve, on three levels: 

  Through cultural and sporting events (such as museum visits, theatre, sports matches) once a month By sharing insight into the professional world, inviting the mentee to reflect on his own career and meeting other professionals By encouraging the mentee person to be confident and aim to study to achieve their full potential. 

  Cultural patronage 

  The Foundation provides financial support for cultural events. 

  In 2019 it renewed its support for the pedagogical studies relating to the Aix-en-Provence festival.

  CMA CGM employees involved in protecting the Calanques national park in Marseilles 

  As part of CMA CGM’s CSR month, the Group held an environmental event in partnership with the Calanques national park, a remarkably place of natural beauty near Marseilles. Created in 2012, it is the first national park close to a city, which is both land-based (8,500 hectares) and marine-based (43,500 hectares). Approximately 2 million people visit the park every year. 

  The objective of the collaboration between the Calanques national park and CMA CGM is to protect and enhance the value of the park’s natural heritage through employees’ involvement. Fifty employees from the head office participated in a clean-up initiative on the island where the lighthouse Phare du Planier is located. It is the first visible sign from the entrance of Marseilles and a historical landmark that needs to be protected.

  Emergency assistance – natural 

  disasters The CMA CGM Group provides coordinated assistance alongside public authorities and humanitarian organisations to people suffering from natural disasters, and to respond to immediate basic needs worldwide in times of crisis. CMA CGM’s teams provide logistics expertise for transporting material, and collect donations in kind (water, food, clothes), reflecting their commitment to improving the lives of people in extremely vulnerable situations and acting to help those most in need. 

  An illustrative selection of actions undertaken in 2019: In March 2019, the coastal town of Beira in Mozambique was 90% destroyed by the cyclone Ida. The CMA CGM Group worked with the French Embassy and World Food Programme to transport emergency aid. In October 2019, several regions in the Philippines were affected by a severe earthquake. More than 188,000 people lost their homes. CMA CGM Group employees acted to provide basic necessities in partnership with the non-governmental organisation Lingap Gabriela. CMA CGM Group facilitated the transport of materials free of charge (over land with CEVA Logistics and via maritime transport with CMA CGM). 

  In December 2019, the CMA CGM Group launched the operation CMA CGM supports Lebanon to provide support through this period of economic and social trouble to the most disadvantaged people. The CMA CGM Group bought 35 tonnes of food products from local producers and two tonnes of medicines, which were given to 14 local non-governmental organisations. They were distributed through the volunteer participation of employees from CMA CGM and CEVA Logistics in Lebanon.

  Humanitarian Service Unit 

  At the end of 2017 CMA CGM decided to create a humanitarian service unit to provide a single contact point for international and non-governmental organisations. The unit provides tailored solutions to organisations working in emergency situations, facilitating aid by: 

   Providing them with direct access to CMA CGM’s global network of agencies and services  Centralising and streamlining assistance to provide specific transport solutions to meet their 

  requirements  Providing professional advice from experienced Group experts on logistics issues  Providing guidance on the transport of humanitarian aid supplies, via adapted transport systems 

  through reliable, safe, tailored end-to-end solutions at competitive prices  Helping them to maximise the effect of the aid that they provide and contribute to finding solutions to humanitarian crises 

  Since the Humanitarian service unit was set up, international and non-governmental organisations have praised the initiative and work daily with the unit to find adapted solutions. In 2019, the unit enabled the humanitarian transport of 11,069 TEU containers.

  NOTE METHODOLOGIQUE METHODOLOGY 

  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 156

  


**************************** Page 157****************************

  Note: The scope of this Corporate Social Responsibility Report is the CMA CGM Group excluding CEVA Logistics, which was acquired by the Group in 2019. The process of integrating CEVA Logistics data into the business model, non-financial risk map and CSR reporting is underway. Consolidated data will be finalised in 2020 and will be disclosed in the 2020 CSR Report. 

  Note that the following information has been considered not applicable to the Group’s business activity:  Fight against food insecurity  Fight against food waste  Protection of animal welfare  Responsible, fair and sustainable food 

  Environment The reporting period runs from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. 

  Maritime fuel oil consumption: Fuel oil consumption is monitored for the entire fleet in operation. Fuel oil consumption for land activities is considered insignificant in comparison. Fuel oil consumption of maritime activity is expressed in tonnes of fuel oil and represents the total consumption of different types of fuel oil used by the fleet (HSFO / LSFO / MGO-DO)/ GNL) Q consumed per voyage = ∑ ROB beginning voyage – ROB end of voyage + ∑ voyage bunkers purchase. 

  Maritime carbon dioxide emissions: carbon dioxide emissions relate to the entire operated fleet and are expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide. They are directly calculated from fuel oil consumption. The following emission factors are applied to fuel oil consumption for maritime activity: 

  1 tonne HSFO = 3.114 tonnes of carbon dioxide 1 tonne LSFO = 3.151 tonnes of carbon dioxide 1 tonne MGO/ DO = 3.206 tonnes of carbon dioxide 1 tonne LNG = 2.75 tonnes of carbon dioxide Ref: “RESOLUTION MEPC.245(66) 2014 GUIDELINES ON THE METHOD OF CALCULATION OF THE ATTAINED ENERGY EFFICIENCY DESIGN INDEX (EEDI) FOR NEW SHIPS”. 

  Les Carbon dioxide emissions/loaded TEU: Carbon dioxide emissions per loaded TEU is equal to the total direct emissions from the consumption of fuel by the CMA CGM fleet (scope 1 of the GHG protocol) divided by remunerated loaded TEUs (KPI 141). Scope: CMA CGM Group fleet (owned and chartered vessels). 

  Definition of Scope 3: Scope 3 emissions are emissions resulting from ship- and container-building, on-board solid and liquid waste, employee business travel, fuel oil consumption before and after maritime shipping, and upstream bunker production and transport. 

   Ship building: For each vessel built in the year, we consider the light displacement (excluding ballast, fuel, oil, cargo) in tonnes and we apply an emission factor of 1.75 (1.75

  tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted to produce 1 tonne of 

  steel).  Container building: For all the containers built during the year on behalf of CMA CGM, we consider the empty weight (tare weight of a twenty-foot container = 2.2 tonnes) and we apply an emission factor of 1.75 (1.75 tonnes of carbon 

  dioxide emitted to produce 1 tonne of steel)  Solid waste: Owned vessels take part in our Green Ship programme, and therefore report the amount of solid waste produced. We apply an emission factor of 182 kg of carbon dioxide per cubic metre of waste to the total 

  volume of solid waste reported.  Liquid waste: Mainly sludge produced by the vessel. For 2019, the estimated ratio of sludge to bunker fuel consumed was 2.36%, therefore we consider 2.36% of 

  carbon dioxide produced.  Employee business trips: The CMA CGM Group in-house travel agency reports carbon dioxide emissions stemming from trips (train/airplane) of the Group’s business travellers outbound from France. This corresponds to the 

  Head Office scope.  Fuel oil consumption before and after maritime shipping: We extract this information from the Group’s booking management system using a “transport mode” criterion that groups together shipping by external service providers (Barge / Rail / Road / Third-Party Feeder). We then apply the standard emission factors for each transport mode in order to calculate the corresponding carbon footprint. (Source: Carbon dioxide emission of transport services, Methodological Guide / French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, 2017 for rail, road 

  and barge; CMA CGM source for third party feeder data).  Upstream fuel production and transport emissions: we use the emission factors of the EcotransIT base which applies the default factors of the EN16258 standard. For MDO: 0.68 kg CO 2 e/kg. For HFO: 0.26 kg http://www.ecotransit.org/download/ETW_Methodology _Background_Report_2016.pdf (p. 96). 

  SOx emissions: SOx emissions cover the entire operated fleet and are expressed in tonnes of sulphur oxide. SOx emissions are calculated based on fuel oil consumption per type of fuel oil, the average sulphur content per type of fuel oil, and the emission factor of sulphur to SOx: 2 tonnes of SOx are emitted for per tonne of sulphur (S) in the fuel oil. (Source: EEMS Atmospheric Emissions Calculation). An average sulphur content weighted by quantity is calculated for each type of fuel oil. Note: where data is missing, the default sulphur content is reported. 

  NOx emissions: NOx emissions cover the entire operated fleet. NOx emissions for land activities are considered insignificant in comparison and are not consolidated at this time. NOx emissions are expressed in tonnes of nitrogen oxide.

  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 157

  


**************************** Page 158****************************

  NOx = total fuel consumption by type * NOx emission factor by type of fuel The following emission factors are applied to the fuel consumption for the maritime activity:  HSFO/LSFO: 86 kg of NOx/tonnes of fuel oil  DO: 56 kg of NOx/tonnes of fuel oil (Source: Third IMO Greenhouse Gas Study 2014) 

  Spills: Spills are unintentional discharges of hazardous or non- hazardous effluent from the vessels, whether or not the CMA CGM Group is liable. The reporting scope pertains to the Group’s owned fleet and is based on feedback from the Report of Notification (RON) sent in by the vessels. 

  Solid waste: The volume of solid waste (hazardous and non- hazardous) is reported by ships through a waste reduction programme called “Green Ship”. Each vessel sends a summary of solid waste generated on board by category, based on the crew’s visual estimation. The quantity of waste is expressed in cubic metres or in pieces, depending on the category. These reports are then compiled and the figures analysed to determine the total volume of waste generated by the owned fleet. Sludge is not taken into account in this indicator. 

  Sludge: Sludge production covers the entire operated fleet and is expressed in tonnes. The quantity of sludge is calculated using a ratio that is calculated annually by the Sludge team based on the quantities discharged and inspected during sludge unloading operations. This ratio is applied to the total quantity of fuel oil burnt over the year in order to calculate the quantity of sludge produced. 

  Terminal water consumption: Terminal water consumption pertains to those terminals subject to the Corporate Terminals and Inland QHSSE policy, i.e. 68% in 2019 – 17 out of 25 terminals 2019 Scope of Terminals subject to the Corporate Terminals and Inland QHSSE policy: Malta Freeport Terminal Ltd., Somaport, Terminal Grand Ouest, Terminal des Flandres, Thessaloniki Port Authority S.A., Kingston Freeport Terminal Ltd., Adani CMA Mundra Terminal Pvt. Ltd, Kribi Container Terminal, Med Europe Terminal, Marseilles Manutention, HUB Océan Indien – SAMR, Brooklyn Kiev Port, Port of Iraq, Berth n°5, Baghdad Dry Port, Lattakia International Container Terminal, PROGECO Natal, PROGECO Fortaleza, Ridah Freezone Terminal, Terminal Maritima de Guadalquivir, CMA CGM Guadeloupe, CMA CGM Martinique, SOMARIG, APL Kaohsiung Container Terminal, APL Yokohama Terminal, Vietnam International Container Terminals, Dutch Harbour, Kodiak 

  Social Social indicators were defined in 2013 and updated in 2019. Established based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) criteria and designed to meet French legal requirements (NRE Act of 15 May 2001 and the European Union Non-Financial Reporting

  Directive), while including current international standards to the greatest extent possible. 

  Scope: CMA CGM Group reports non-financial data based on a consolidated scope excluding CEVA Logistics. The total workforce and breakdown of workforce per region apply to the consolidated entities in the global scope as at 31 December of the reference year. Data on gender, age, new hires & exits and women managers are only available for a limited portion of the consolidated scope, since some subsidiaries have not reported this data. 

  The scope of classroom training data corresponds to office- based employees in France, Estonia, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, USA and China and seafaring personnel, i.e. 44% of the Group’s consolidated workforce excluding CEVA Logistics. The scope of e-learning training data corresponds to office-based and seafaring employees worldwide, i.e. 100% of the Group’s consolidated workforce excluding CEVA Logistics. 

  Period: The reporting period runs from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 and from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. 

  Office-based personnel: C&Me reporting tools (excluding international seafaring personnel scope): The indicators are collected and consolidated by the HR C&Me information system. C&Me relates to 88% of the Group consolidated workforce. Excel spreadsheets supplement the reporting for office-based employees – these relate to 6% of the Group workforce. 

  Workforce: Note 1 : The workforce broken down per individual relates to the Group’s global consolidated scope as of 31 December of the reference year. It includes employees with an employment contract at one of the CMA CGM Group’s companies as of 31 December of the reference year. The following are included: permanent employment contracts, temporary employment contracts, expatriates (by site of secondment), employees on maternity or paternity leave, trainees and VIE participants (excluding France). Note 2 : The workforce broken down by gender includes the percentage of male employees and the percentage of female employees. Age distribution is broken down as follows: less than 20 years old, 20 to 29 years old, 30 to 39 years old, 40 to 49 years old, 50 to 59 years old, 60 years and older. These categories were established based on available data. Some branches and subsidiaries do not report due to specific local regulatory constraints (or inclusion in scope). Note 3: The breakdown of workforce by region pertains to: France, Europe (excluding France), Africa – Middle-East, the Americas and Asia – Oceania.

  New hires and departures 

  CSR Report 2019 – CMA CGM Group 158

  


**************************** Page 159****************************

  Note 1 : New hires are counted as the number of employees who joined the company between 1 January and 31 December of the reference year, depending on the contracts as defined in Note 1 / Workforce. Someone is also considered a new hire in their company when they are reassigned, sign a new employment contract with a different company within the Group, or have an amendment to their original contract that results in a permanent assignment to a different Group company. Note 2 : Departures relate to the number of employees leaving the workforce at their own initiative or that of the company between 1 January and 31 December of the reference year, for employees under contract. 

  Percentage of women in managerial positions: number of women managers/total number of managers (men and women)

  Training 

  Note 1 : All types of training courses are included (internal and external) and all training methods (classroom, e- learning) are counted, as long as the training action contains an educational objective, is tracked and is administered by an employee of the CMA CGM Group. 

   Classroom-based training courses longer than one hour are counted. The calculation is based on the hours of training provided to employees and not the planned, scheduled or budgeted hours. Scope: France, USA, United Kingdom, 

  Malaysia, China, Brazil, Estonia  E-learning courses (interactive content) are counted as from 4 minutes in length, and educational videos as from 30 seconds of connection. E-learning hours are tracked based on the hours completed, unless the connection time is illogical (i.e. more than twice the suggested time to completion and 1.25 for IMDG training). In this case, the suggested time to completion is reported. Scope: Global

  French seafaring staff The payroll tool specific to French Crewing is used to obtain all the HR data of French seafarers. 

  International seafaring staff The workforce counted in the International Crewing HR indicators correspond to seafarers with a permanent employment contract or a contract with CMA CGM, any of its subsidiaries, CMA Ships Singapore and its agencies: these seafarers work on the vessels of the CMA CGM Group fleet, the vessels of other ship-owners, which carry out one-off jobs with other entities of the Group. If the shore-based assignment is definitive (via a change of contract), the employee is therefore counted in the office-based workforce. Staff in training and on leave are also counted. The nationalities of International Crewing are those declared by the seafarers in administrative paperwork. 

  French and International female naval officers: the status of officer in the Merchant Navy includes Deck Officers (composed of the ranks of Master, Chief Officer, Second Officer, Third Officer and Polyvalent Officer) and Engine Officers (composed of the ranks of Chief Engineer, Second Engineer, Third Engineer, Electrical Officer and Reeferman). 

  Training of French and international Crewing: The number of training hours for French and international seafaring personnel is the sum of e-learning training hours added to the number of classroom-based training hours:  The number of classroom-based training hours is obtained by applying an average duration of 7 hours of training per 

  day of training administered  The number of e-learning training hours is obtained via the online training software 

  Health and Safety Major maritime incident: Any maritime accident impacting personal health and safety (serious injury or death), the environment (national impact or with a recovery period of more than one year), the public image of the Group (accident covered by the international media) or with financial consequences exceeding €1 million. 

  Workplace safety: Fatal industrial accidents and accidents with leave longer than one day are tracked and consolidated at the Group level by CMA Ships, for the owned fleet maritime activity, and by SSE Terminals CMA CGM HO, for terminals under management. Accidents that occurred on chartered vessels are not reported or consolidated, since they are under the liability of the ship owners.

  With reference to the percentage of change presented in the business model: 

  LTIFR Terminals Maritime 2014 36 1.55 

  2015 31 1.78 

  2016 29.5 1.63 

  2017 19.1 0.9 

  2018 13.2 1.25 

  2019 13.2 1.88 

  Frequency of maritime industrial accidents: The frequency of industrial accidents is calculated for the maritime scope (fleet owned by CMA Ships) based on the number of accidents with sick leave and the total number of hours worked. It includes accidents among the seafaring staff employed by the Group, as well as the seafaring staff employed by manning agencies. An accident with leave is considered to be any accident that results in leave from work on board ship, of more than 24 hours in duration and on the basis of a medical opinion. Accidents resulting in leave only after disembarkation are not taken into account. 

  Number of shipping activity hours worked: sum of the actual number of days on board x 24 hours (corresponds to the number of hours per seafarer spent on board, including nights). Frequency = number of industrial accidents / (number of hours worked) x 1,000,000. 

  Severity scale of maritime industrial accidents: Number of days’ sick leave further to an industrial accident per thousand hours worked over a rolling period of twelve months. For seafaring staff no longer in the workforce as of 31/12/N, the days of leave which occurred during year N are not taken into account in the calculation of accident severity. 

  Frequency of accidents with bodily injury with sick leave for terminal employees: The frequency is calculated over the scope of those terminals subject to the CMA CGM Terminals and Inland QHSSE policy based on the number of industrial accidents with sick leave of more than one day and the total number of hours worked. FR = (number of accidents / number of hours worked) x 1,000,000 

  2018 scope of Terminals subject to the CMA CGM HO Terminals and Inland QHSSE policy: Dutch Harbor APL Terminal Unalaska / Kingston Freeport Terminal / SAMR La Réunion / GMM Martinique / GMG Jarry Terminal Guadeloupe / SOMARIG Guyane / TGO Montoir / TDF Dunkerque / BKP Odessa / Medeurope Terminal Marseille / Marseille Manutention / Malta Freeport Terminal / Terminal Sevilla / Thessaloniki / Lattakia / Umm Qasr Berth n°5 / Casablanca / Kribi / Mundra / Yokohama / Kaohsiung / VICT Vietnam / Natal

  Ethics and compliance Number of reports processed and closed Scope: all reports available from the Group whistleblowing platform (Navex), which have been processed and closed. This indicator covers reports relating not only to ethics, but also human resources and security. Calculation method: reports are made directly in the software, and data is extracted from the tool using the filter and period of time requested. 

  CSR challenges The Group’s major CSR challenges were identified in partnership with various Group departments: Environment, Security, Health & Safety, Human Resources, Ethics & Compliance, Procurement and Risk.

  An initial list of material CSR challenges for the maritime transport sector was drawn up using a documentary and regulatory analysis. The following challenges were identified:  Business ethics: economic sanctions and embargoes, free competition, corruption, conflict of interests, fraud, data 

  confidentiality and privacy  Value chain: Customer Centricity and lasting partnerships 

  with suppliers  Social: diversity, gender equality and inclusion, employee 

  working conditions, employee development  Health, safety and security: maritime safety, occupational safety (H&S), cargo security, asset security, international 

  security  Environment: energy transition, resources, raw materials 

  and waste, ocean biodiversity  Society: territorial development and integration, sponsorship, local actions, philanthropy, Emergency Relief and the CMA CGM Foundation 

  Assessment of importance for CMA CGM Each of the challenges determined is assessed by the various departments based on four criteria: finance, legal/regulatory, operation/ business, image/reputation. The challenges were then ranked by priority based on the following criteria: 

  +++: CMA CGM has identified the importance of this CSR challenge and has made it one of its priorities. The Group implements the necessary resources to address this challenge ++: CMA CGM has identified this CSR challenge as important and has set up related actions +: CMA CGM has identified that this CSR challenge is not a priority for the moment and has implemented limited actions or has not set up any actions for the moment. 

  Assessment of importance for CMA CGM stakeholders For this assessment, stakeholders were not directly contacted. Stakeholders were identified based on their influence on Group business. They are divided into two sub-groups: Priority stakeholders: government, public authorities, investors, customers, shareholders, employees / trade unions, suppliers, subcontractors Secondary stakeholders: NGOs, media, professional organisations, local communities. 

  The challenges were then ranked by priority based on the following criteria: +++: The stakeholder has determined that the CMA CGM CSR challenge is a fundamental challenge from its standpoint ++: The stakeholder has determined that the CMA CGM CSR challenge is secondary from its standpoint +: The stakeholder has determined that the CMA CGM CSR challenge is not a priority for the moment from its standpoint 

  Note: In 2018, 95 Group and subsidiary employees gave their views on the CMA CGM CSR approach.

**************************** Page 162****************************

  CSR risks With support from the Risk Management Department, a CSR risk map relating to the materiality matrix is being prepared. The 2018 work involved: 

   Identifying the existing Group risks in connection with one of the 15 Group CSR challenges and determining the 

  challenges with no associated risks  Drafting the “CSR” risk map of risks and associated challenges. The rules applied are: 

  - Depending on the business and scope, several risks are grouped into a “risk category”, for which the current risk level is defined by the average frequency and severity of the risk if it occurs.

  - If a given challenge falls into two risk categories, the final risk level is the higher of the two. 

   Comparing challenge assessments to risks. In this exercise, gaps were identified and explained as follows: 

  - The importance of the challenge is higher than its risk: the challenge is considerable and known. CMA CGM has undertaken actions to limit the risk inherent to the challenge > Therefore, the risk is controlled, and the 

  challenge remains considerable. - The importance of the challenge is less than its risk: the challenge is emerging. CMA CGM is implementing actions to mitigate the risk > Therefore, the risk is more important than the challenge itself, given the procedures and work underway.

  entity and on a selection of entities 58 .  We verified that the Report covers the consolidation scope, i.e. all the consolidated entities in accordance with article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial 

  Code, within the limits set out in the Report;  We gained an understanding of the internal control and risk management procedures the entity has put in place and assessed the data collection process to ensure the completeness and fairness of the 

  Information;  For the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most significant as presented in the Appendix, we implemented: - analytical procedures to verify the proper consolidation of the data collected and the 

  consistency of any changes in those data; - tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the proper application of the definitions and procedures and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities 4 and covers between 25% and 100% of the 

  consolidated data selected for these tests;  We assessed the overall consistency of the Report based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.

  We believe that the work carried out, based on our professional judgment, is sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. 

  Means and resources Our work was carried out by a team of five people between November 2019 and March 2020 and took a total of eight weeks. We were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. We conducted around fifteen interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Report. 

  Conclusion Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the non- financial performance report is not presented in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects. 

  Comment Without modifying our conclusion and in accordance with article A. 225-3 of the French Commercial Code, we have the following matter to report: With the exception of certain social data provided on the Group scope, the Report covers the Group scope excluding CEVA Logistics, an entity acquired during financial year 2019 and representing 55% of the Group's workforce. CEVA Logistics will be incorporated into the 2020 Non-Financial Performance Report, as mentioned in the appendix "Methodology" of the Management Report.
