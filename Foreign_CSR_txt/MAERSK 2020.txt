  " I strongly believe that we, as an industry leader and with the resources available to us, have an obligation to do all we can to get to a carbon neutral fleet as fast as possible."

  Letter from 

  2020 was year of contrasts. While the pace of modern life slowed down due to restrictions or lockdowns, trends and change agendas on digitisation and sustainability accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. While some industries came to a sudden halt others surged. And while lives and livelihoods were lost at tragic rates, human ingenuity and adaptability rose to new heights. 

  Even though borders closed, air traffic stopped and roads blocked across the globe, global supply chains remained open. The geographical presence and leadership position of A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk) enabled us to find new ways of keeping essential goods moving for customers and societies, as they kept businesses running and fought the virus. Just as we in our company focused on protecting our employees, who play an instrumental role in moving global trade while dealing with long shifts at sea and disruptive, new routines on shore. I remain tremendously proud to experience how we responded to this global emergency by showing resilience,

  innovation and a natural willingness to care for colleagues, serve customers and help society respond and recover. I am at the same time saddened by the fact that the COVID-19 virus has claimed the lives of some of our colleagues. 

  Sustainability as a fully integrated business priority Even as the urgent priorities of the pandemic and our business transformation have kept us busy, sustainability remains at the top of our agenda, and we continue our commitment and support for the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. We see an acceleration in expectations from all stakeholders, not least customers, investors and employees. In 2020, we updated our sustainability priorities to further integrate sustainability into our business strategy, and we are accelerating our efforts to decarbonise shipping. 

  The pandemic has only reinforced our role in multiplying the benefits of trade and in making these accessible to all so that more people and businesses can be part of a global, open

  and inclusive trading system. Towards this end, we work to reduce complexity by digitising global trade. As physical lockdowns moved more customers online during 2020, we saw significant growth in our digital solutions, such as Maersk Spot, the Maersk app and Twill. 

  A step-up on decarbonisation Decarbonising logistics is where we can and must move the needle the most for sustainable development. Maersk remains fully committed to our ambition of eliminating greenhouse gas emissions, as we continue to work towards net-zero emissions from our ocean activities in 2050; a 60% relative reduction in emissions from shipping by 2030 compared to 2008, and investigating how we can expand our net-zero ambition to cover our full operations and value chain across all emission scopes. We recognise that climate action is a strategic imperative for our company and have redesigned our organisation in order to embed the agenda and ensure collaboration across our business activities. 

  In 2020, we began a process to step up our efforts on decarbonisation. I strongly believe that we, as an industry leader and with the resources available to us, have an obligation to do all we can to get to a carbon-neutral fleet as fast as possible. We will not be using transition fuels, but will instead leapfrog directly to net zero fuels. The launch of the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping in 2020, made possible by our majority shareholder, the A.P. Moller Foundation, together with a group of industry-leading players, is an important step in aid of our commitments. 

  As Maersk 's presence grows on land to offer integrated logistics solutions, so does our responsibility and commitment to help our customers decarbonise their global supply chains end to end. This is an integral part of our strategic promise of serving all our customers' transportation and logistics needs, and we will engage with customers and industry partners to develop standards and solutions to support this green transition. 

  Strengthening the foundation We are strengthening the responsible business practices that constitute the foundation of our sustainable end-to-end offerings to our customers as well as our own operations.

  Guided by our core company values, our commitments to international standards and guidelines, and with high expectations from customers, investors, regulators, employees and other stakeholders, we continue to address challenges across our operations and supply chains, including key areas such as ship recycling and safety. 

  We have taken on the task of using our leverage to drive responsible practices in the ship recycling industry. After four years in Alang, India, we know that this is possible, and with still larger vessels in our fleet nearing end of life, it is imperative that we create opportunities for responsible ship recycling at yards outside OECD countries. We are engaging actively to find options that ensure enforcement of international conventions while also enabling global opportunities for responsible ship recycling that benefit both shipowners and local communities. 

  Failing safely The foundation for safety in Maersk is to build capacity for 'failing safely', acknowledging that even while all precautionary measures must be applied, some accidents and incidents are likely to still occur, but the implications of these should be as small as possible. 

  One of our contractors lost his life while working for Maersk in 2020. This saddens me deeply and emphasises that we need to do more to manage our risks and build the capacity we need to avoid such a tragic event. 

  To this end, we centralised the organisation of our safety work in 2020. The new organisation reinforces that Maersk has one shared safety strategy which is implemented and enforced equally across the company. 

  The decision is driven by the need to match and mirror the integrated company that Maersk is becoming, and also by the need to establish a stronger link between the company’s strategic priorities and the implementation level, to ensure that we continue to learn and manage risks by listening to our frontline employees. Most importantly to ensure the continuous safety and security of our people, but also to assure our customers that this is the case when they leave their supply chain obligations in our hands.

  In simple terms, we will not be satisfied until we reach our ambition of eliminating fatalities and severe injuries and provide safe and resilient products and services to our customers. 

  Social movements a timely reminder 2020 saw the renewed strength of social movements to promote race and gender equality. 

  Our global presence means that we are affected by events and movements regardless of where they take place. Notable examples such as Black Lives Matter in the US, which has spilled over to many other countries, and new waves of #metoo serve as timely reminders that we must continue conversations on diversity and inclusion and take action where needed. 

  Maersk is a values-driven company. We treat our colleagues and partners with respect and dignity, and we do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind. It is as simple as that. 

  In 2020, we have addressed these issues in our organisation and clarified how we deal with them. We have clear policies in place and a whistleblower system with a range of reporting options. 

  For Maersk, 2020 was a year of crises in global health and economies, lockdowns, closed borders and distress – but also of new opportunities for our company, accelerated progress towards our strategic goals and a chance to see what we as leaders and our employees are truly capable of. 

  In the coming year we will be applying our capacity to the global distribution of vaccines and to keeping supply chains open, and as such we will continue to play our part in enabling open, inclusive and sustainable trade – together.

  Defining a sustainable business strategy Our sustainability efforts have matured over the last decade with increasing ambitions matching the maturity of the field and expectations of our leading customers and key stakeholders. The sustainability strategy and ambitions we defined in 2017 have served well in creating positive impact along multiple dimensions. We have made significant progress on the four shared value priorities that we identified in 2017 as those where Maersk has the strongest potential to contribute towards the Sustainable Development Goals, leveraging our business

  expertise and assets: decarbonising logistics, multiplying the benefits of trade, contributing to halving food loss, and leading change in the ship recycling industry. We have progressively embedded responsibility for sustainability implementation into core functions and business areas, and we are now ready to integrate our sustainability priorities as an embedded part of our business strategy. 

  In 2020, we have defined updated sustainability priorities for the Global Integrator strategy: Enabling sustainable trade by decarbonising logistics, sustainability in our end-to-end offerings and responsible business practices. • We will take leadership on decarbonising logistics as our single most important strategic sustainability priority.

  • We will increase our focus on end-to-end sustainability in our offerings in response to the increased responsibility and opportunity to manage supply chain risks for our customers as 

  part of our Global Integrator business strategy. • We continue to ensure responsible business practices across our operations with clear governance, accountability, and transparency on policies, commitments and performance. 

  Our commitments on inclusive trade and food loss are fully owned and driven in line of business, and remain part of our reporting on sustainability as they are integral to our strategy and what we do as a business. Responsible ship recycling is also fully owned in line of the business and part of ensuring responsible business practices.

  Revisions and additions to our model We are simplifying our representation of

  Material sustainability issues 2020 Based on research, stakeholder dialogue and management prioritisation, we determine how sustainability issues are material to Maersk by applying criteria and filters of risk, responsibility and strategic opportunity assessment.

  sustainability in core processes related to strategy, performance, planning and risk management. 

  In 2020, we revised the governance structure on decarbonising logistics to support an acceleration of our efforts. This includes an expanded steering committee with two executive members serving as an accountable decision-making forum, supported by a broader decarbonisation advisory group, preparing work plans and strategies and ensuring alignment across the company. The advisory group has defined a set of workstreams covering

  future solutions for net zero carbon shipping. Our engagement with investors, banks and insurers on ESG/sustainability has likewise centred on decarbonisation, but ship recycling, air emissions, ocean health and safety are also topics important to our large investors. 

  We engage actively in many partnerships on key sustainability topics (see overview below). In addition, we are active members of industry organisations such as Danish Shipping and the World Shipping Council.

  end-to-end sustainability in our offerings, and sustainable trade. Furthermore, we continue to be guided by the perspective of double materiality in determining how sustainability issues may constitute responsibilities or risks, enabling us to understand where Maersk has a responsibility to mitigate potential negative impact on society or the environment and where issues may pose significant risk to our business. 

  Our disclosure of sustainability issues as potential risks to our business draws on our

  Stakeholder engagement Five stakeholder groups are prioritised for sustainability strategy, reporting and engagement: customers, employees, investors, authorities and NGOs/thought leaders. Issue owners and leaders across Maersk engage with representatives of these groups as part of their 

  Key partnerships

  Materiality: Working on issues that matter In line with our practice of reviewing materiality annually, we have updated our overview of material sustainability issues drawing on the outcome of stakeholder engagement and research conducted as part of the update of strategic sustainability priorities. The research has provided insights into expectations, leading practices and emerging topics across customers, investors, and broader society, and has added to our existing knowledge and analyses

  enterprise risk management process, which assesses top risks to achieving our business plan within a 5-year horizon. The sustainability issues that are assessed as among our top risks are safety (failure to ensure the safety and security of our employees), climate change (failure to decarbonise our end-to-end supply chain at a speed that matches our customers’ and investors’ expectations), and anti-corruption (being involved in a large compliance case).

  Changes to reporting as a result of strategy and materiality review 

  Our commitments to open, inclusive and sustainable trade are owned in line of business and delivered in particular through strategic investments in digitising global trade. We continue to report on our 2025 commitments as well as on key societal trends in global trade. 

  Air emissions continue to be a material responsibility topic, while the potential financial risk impact of IMO 2020 (lack of enforcement of the cap on sulphur in fuel oil) as reported on in previous years is reduced. 

  Supply chain sustainability risk is becoming more strategically relevant for us in our customer offerings. We report on it in the chapter on end-to-end sustainability in our offerings.

  Human rights in this report 

  There are many aspects of our business that touch on human rights. Commitment to human rights is expressed in the A.P. Moller - Maersk Code of Conduct and our human rights due diligence is described on the following pages of this report.

  12 A.P. Moller - Maersk Sustainability Report 2020 13 Enabling sustainable trade 

  As the global integrator of container logistics, we work to ensure that trade is open, inclusive and sustainable.

  sustainability 

  Sustainable trade, decarbonisation and sustainability in our end-to-end offerings are strategic imperatives to our business.

  Wherever you live, chances are that your living conditions are closely tied to how much and how well your country trades. Since 1980, Bangladesh has seen a four-fold increase in exports with poverty rates declining from 45% to less than 15% today 1 . In South Korea, another trading nation, an average employee generates 13 times more wealth in a day than she did fifty years ago 2 . In Turkey, the typical consumer can attribute a third of their real income to lower prices enabled by trade 3 . 

  Lessons from a pandemic During 2020, we saw how fragile this progress can be – a real-time demonstration of what can happen when economies shut down. The International Labour Organization has estimated that as a result of the pandemic, global labour incomes have declined by more than 10% in 2020, corresponding to hundreds of millions of jobs 4 . The economic hardships caused by COVID-19 are not equally distributed, and inequalities within and among countries are likely to widen. According to the World Bank, during the pandemic the number of people living in extreme poverty (less than USD 1.90 a day) has gone up for the first time in twenty years and there is a real risk that we will not reach the UN Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030 5 . 

  At the same time, 2020 also demonstrated the power of open trade and well-designed logistics. The pandemic has been a demand- side crisis, but bar the initial shut-down in China, and initial shortages of face masks, it has not been a supply-side crisis. Logistics supply chains have kept moving throughout the pandemic. 

  Three factors in particular explain why this has been the case. First, the extraordinary

  efforts of those on the frontline that make trade move: seafarers, dockworkers, warehouse staff, truck drivers and many more. Throughout the crisis, they have kept supply chains moving. For our seafarers and their families this has come at great personal sacrifice (see p. 26). 

  Second, the investments we have made into operational excellence, expansion of our portfolio of services and new digital solutions over the past years have made supply chains much more resilient. Comparing 2020 to 2019, the Maersk App nearly doubled the number of business transactions – from an average of about 21,400 per week in 2019 to an average of about 42,600 per week in 2020. Similarly, business transactions on Maersk.com – one of the world’s largest B2B-sites – are up by 18% year on year. As the pandemic disrupted the global economy, our strategic focus on building end-to-end supply chain visibility helped our customers slow down, speed up and redirect supply as shut-downs rolled through global markets. Third, governments have on the whole consciously worked to keep trade open in order to preserve jobs and economic activity, enabling logistics companies to do their job. 

  Using trade to drive recovery The learnings that helped us during the crisis will also be essential for the rebuild that lies ahead. Open, inclusive and sustainable trade should be at the centre of this effort. 

  Much attention has been focused on the US-China trade war, but trade protectionism has been on the rise among all the G20 economies since the 2009 global financial crisis, and US and China account for no more than a quarter of protectionist measures since 2017. This we can no longer afford. The removal

  of protectionist measures can offer a multi- billion-dollar stimulus to the global economy without burdening taxpayers and public finances. 

  The pandemic has been particularly hard on small and medium-sized businesses that account for two-thirds of all jobs globally. Boosting their access to trade is critical for an inclusive recovery. Furthermore, helping SMEs grow and diversify their export markets will make them and the millions who depend on them more resilient to future crises. 

  Live demonstration of the power of trade 

  It is tempting to think that in an uncertain world, decoupling supply chains and increasing protectionism and self- sufficiency is the way to go. 2020 has demonstrated just how flawed this strategy is. 

  It is because of open supply chains, digital connectivity and rules-based trade that countries and businesses have been able to maintain essential services and supplies, even as half the global population went into lockdown. 

  But while global supply chains are essential during the crisis and for the recovery, going forward it will not be business as usual. The increased need for resilience experienced during the pandemic adds to an already existing set of factors, including technological innovations and geopolitics that are transforming supply chains. We expect that resilience, redundancy and scalability will play a bigger role for our customers, with more focus on the geographic

As part of this work, we recognise that trade finance is one of the key barriers to trade for small businesses, and for this reason we have invested in MODIFI, which specialises in making trade finance 

  "Because of flexible, connected

  accessible to small companies. In 2020, we integrated MODIFI’s offering into Twill. 

  Women-owned businesses and women entrepreneurs hold particular promise in making trade work better for inclusive growth. In 2020, we continued our collaboration with the SheTrades initiative of the International Trade Centre, with the aim of connecting more women to trade. 

  As shippers, logistics providers, customs officers and many more supply chain actors have been holed up at home around the world, digital platforms have enabled them to keep operations moving. Maersk is committed to helping connect 50% of global containerised trade to digital solutions by 2025. The potential impact of reaching this target was demonstrated

  down on the time and cost for importers and exporters to clear their goods. Development of the solution was completed in 2020 and it will be tested by customs authorities in Cambodia and Sri Lanka during 2021. 

  The link between trade and climate change We recognise that concerns over the sustainability of global consumption patterns remain and that in the light of the pandemic, this debate has come to include the added dilemma of jobs and livelihoods lost in production countries in particular. 

  Our premise is that fighting climate change should not be at the expense of trade, because this will lead to another set of sustainability challenges: lack of decent work, increases in

  with in the systems where they occur. 

  In simple terms, we are working to decarbonise how container cargo is moved around the world. The sustainability of what is inside the container is not within our direct sphere of influence, and must as a starting point be dealt with by the cargo owners. 

  Minimising food loss with customers We are helping to halve food loss during transportation as an integrated part of our Cold Chain Logistics business, focusing on developing and scaling solutions to connect and integrate our customers' cold chains. Substantial extra

  We work with customers to test solutions that target produce at the origin, working from harvest to container station and beyond to ensure that the product is treated in the best possible way to sustain quality and secure as little food loss as possible. One such example is how we have worked with citrus growers in Morocco, where preservation of food quality in citrus fruit during transportation was challenging. Our work included quality- preserving processes related to packing,

  investments made by our venture arm, Maersk Growth. These include investments in for example Fliit, a Germany-based digital freight forwarder specializing in food logistics, Ripe.io – a platform leveraging blockchain technology and AI to provide data insights along the food supply chain, and Spoiler Alert, a company building a marketplace for discounted perishables. 

  Our focus during 2020 has been on efforts to create change on the ground, and the development of a metrics framework and broader partnerships to guide and document our impact on food loss in the supply chain remains a work-in-progress.

  Decarbonising

  Our commitments on decarbonisation 

  2030

  2050

  Decarbonisation is a strategic imperative for our industry and our company. We are intensifying our efforts to achieve net zero emissions and support our customers to decarbonise their supply chains.

  Two years after setting our net zero ambition in December 2018, we have come further than we imagined possible at that time. 

  In 2018, a 2050 net zero ambition for shipping was a moonshot goal. Today, we see it as a challenging target, but clearly possible to reach. Customers, investors and authorities are accelerating their ambitions, and their expectations are rising fast for A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk) and our industry to deliver more solutions, more visibility and more help in decarbonising supply chains. 

  Decarbonisation can make or break us In 2020, we conducted a strategic review of global

  climate scenarios and transition pathways (see box on page 21). The conclusion was that climate action is a strategic imperative for all companies, and our company in particular, as we – due to our size and industry reach – have the opportunity to be a driving force in decarbonising shipping and logistics. We are both able and willing to take that role upon us. 

  There are specific trends in our stakeholder environment that underscore the need for urgent action on decarbonisation. First, a logistics provider without an ambitious plan for decarbonisation risks becoming irrelevant in the market, because it would become increasingly difficult for customers to embed services offered into their product offerings. This means that our company cannot be behind the curve on the carbon journey. 

  Second, political action is gradually but continuously beginning to reflect the reality of climate change. Spurred on by science, the evident rise in the number of extreme weather events, as well as pressure from a broad range of stakeholders, lawmakers are working on taxation or other pricing mechanisms as well as disclosure requirements related to CO 2 emissions, to incentivise transformation in all parts of society. These actions both emphasise and potentially mitigate the financial risks of climate change to companies, asset owners and societies. For example, while Maersk supports the introduction of uniform pricing regimes for CO 2 , the potential added cost from a regulatory instrument such as a carbon tax might end up being calculated in billions of dollars for Maersk alone, if we do not decarbonise our operations.

  Continued progress on efficiency By end 2020, we had achieved 46.3% reduction in emissions compared to 2008, with 2.5% of that achieved in 2020 alone.

  Maersk has a history of pioneering solutions and being ahead of our customers' demand. We were first to create a global network driving down the cost of transporting goods. We are the frontrunners in digitising the shipping and logistics industry with blockchain and web-

  Biodiesel • Can be used as drop-in fuel in existing vessels and engines

  now want to reinforce our position, and we see this as an expression of our obligation – as an industry leader and with the resources available to us – to do all we can to get to a carbon- neutral fleet as fast as possible and to help our customers decarbonise their global supply chains end to end. 

  Today, 90 of our top 200 customers have set or are in the process of setting ambitious science-based or zero carbon targets. We have since 2018 been committed to set a science- based target, and we are actively engaging with the Science-Based Target Initiative on developing a methodology for shipping. Once this work is finalised, expected in the first half of 2021, we want to relate our emission reduction targets to this new calculation

  Launched in 2019, Maersk ECO Delivery remains one of only a few options for carbon-neutral emissions shipping on the global market so far. 

  A market for net zero emissions shipping Building on the increased momentum from our customers, in 2020 we implemented a new commercial strategy on sustainability aiming to respond to and aid customers on their decarbonisation journey, however far they have come. 

  One key feature in this is the Maersk ECO Delivery product. Launched in 2019, it remains

  that the commoditised freight market is open for price differentiation related to sustainability. Driven by the end-consumers' increased willingness to pay for sustainability, and growing climate urgency, this represents a solid contribution to the development of a business model for decarbonised logistics and transport, lowering the risk we take on when investing in the development of decarbonised logistics and transport services (shipping, rail, road, air). 

  Reflecting this, we have developed a multi- tier value proposition for sustainable logistics, allowing us to respond to customer needs aligned with their maturity and ambition level for carbon reductions. We continue to build ties and partnerships with the group of customers who match or exceed our ambitions on

  Intensifying our efforts To be true to our history and strategic promise, we are in the process of reviewing our decarbonisation ambitions, and investigating where we can raise the bar. To drive this and coordinate all related processes, a new Decarbonisation function was launched in January 2021, tasked with ensuring collaboration across commercial, operational, technological,

  one of only a few options for carbon-neutral emissions shipping on the global market so far. 

  Maersk ECO delivery uses externally certified biodiesel in the form of used cooking oil to power vessels in our network. The CO 2 savings generated from this are used to neutralise emissions related to transport of specific cargo by customers. 

  In 2020, customer uptake of Maersk ECO delivery shipping exceeded our expectations. So far, approximately ten major customers have chosen to purchase this carbon-neutral emissions

  decarbonisation, and the solutions we co-develop with them are crucial levers in showcasing and shaping the broader market of the future. 

  A very relevant aspect related to the value proposition of net zero emissions logistics is understanding where the cost of transition will be felt. Analysis from the Energy Transitions Commission 7 shows that for most product categories, price increases for final consumers will be negligible, even though the intermediate costs are higher. See graphic below.

  The future of fuels Over the past two years, we have conducted an extensive analysis of the available technology and fuel options for net zero carbon operations. Based on this work, we have concluded that there are technologies that are mature enough for us to participate in their development to scale by acting as an ambitious customer. 

  A broad range of technologies were evaluated and the four primary pathways we are now pursuing can be seen in the table above. As part of this process, we also de- selected a number of potential technologies.

  Barriers to progress As shown in the graphic on the next page, fuel transformation involves the entire supply chain, and holds barriers to progress which we are working to overcome: 

  • Scaling fuel production and associated technology The main limitation to developing net zero emission vessels is availability of new fuels at scale. We are engaged in several fuel manufacturing projects for both methanol and ammonia, just as our participation in

  We will collaborate with fuel suppliers to develop a fuelling network that serves our needs. 

  • Safety-related issues For methanol and ethanol, there are issues related to flammability that will have to be resolved. There are already some operational experience available for methanol as a shipping fuel. For ammonia, the main issue is toxicity, and safe solutions will have to be developed before it can be used as marine fuel. However, ammonia is today handled

  "Our conversations with customers are increasingly focused on supporting their ambitions to decarbonise their supply chains, and ensuring flexible and resilient transport solutions."

  For example, bio-methane and liquified natural gas, fuel cells, nuclear and onboard carbon capture due to concerns related to one or more of the steps in the fuel transformation supply chain (see illustration on the next page). For bio-methane and liquified natural gas, for example, we are very concerned with levels of methane emissions, and the risk of tying investments to marginal CO 2 reductions rather

  the LEO coalition continues, where we in collaboration with partners incl. customers and researchers work on the lignin fuel option in the table above. In combination, these projects will deliver substantially towards the power needs of our entire fleet, albeit price premiums may remain a barrier to uptake.

  The Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping 

  The Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping is an independent, non-profit, leading-edge research and development centre launched in June 2020. Mobilising around 100 of the best minds from industry, academia, energy, fuel and ship technology, regulatory affairs and finance, the centre will work to create overviews of decarbonisation pathways, accelerate the development of selected decarbonising energies and powering technologies as well as support the establishment of regulatory, financial and commercial means to enable and drive the transformation. 

  The centre is made possible by a start-up donation of DKK 400m by the A.P. Moller Foundation. The founding partners are American Bureau of Shipping, A.P. Moller - Maersk, Cargill, MAN Energy Solutions, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, NYK Lines and Siemens, and many more partners are expected to join.

  The need for broad-based action The final piece of our decarbonisation strategy relates to the policy frameworks established to further this process. Policies must not only secure that low performers are held accountable, but also that the first movers are truly rewarded for the risks taken on behalf of the whole industry. 

  With very few exceptions, the political and legislative debate is currently not moving fast enough to fulfil its role. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) must start to address concrete long-term measures in order to close the competitiveness gap between fossil and renewable fuels. Global measures to accelerate the transition and create a more level playing field are essential, and for this reason the limited outcome of the IMO meeting in 2020 was disappointing. We also advocate that lawmakers build incentive structures that reward first movers and remove a share of the financial risk related to decarbonisation. There is a very real danger that regulators are out of sync with the progress and development pushed by industry, which would be to no one’s benefit. 

  At regional level, there is no doubt that shipping will be part of the EU Emissions Trading System, which is the world's biggest scheme for trading

  greenhouse gas emissions allowances, also known as CO 2 credits. However, this needs to be done with the objective of actually lowering shipping emissions and with a view to supporting an international greenhouse gas reduction agreement. Moreover, the many related EU initiatives must also fit into a puzzle whereby greenhouse gas emissions overall are lowered while still supporting modal shift of cargo to sea, which will remain the most sustainable way of transporting large quantities of cargo. 

  The transition will not happen without strong regulatory frameworks. IMO Member States have a fundamental role in securing progress. These processes take time, but there is real benefit to having a global solution which is enforceable and protects first-movers. 

  In parallel, private action and advocacy initiatives should also continue. We are very proud to have been part of the recent launch of the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping (see box). This independent centre will engage scientists from all over the world in trying to find solutions on fuels for shipping. Additionally, we have joined hands with Ørsted, the largest energy company in Denmark, and other leading Danish companies in establishing a project to develop a new hydrogen plant, which can be part of the solution

  Progress and increased disclosure on CO 2 efficiency Our target is to deliver 60% relative CO 2 reduction by 2030 (compared to 2008 baseline). By the end of 2020, we had reduced emissions by 46.3%. We are from 2020 using an improved methodology to calculate relative reductions, which enhances the accuracy 8 . 

  Climate-related risks and opportunities to our business 

  In 2020, we conducted a strategic review to analyse the likelihood and implications of different pathways for global warming, and how these might impact our business in terms of both physical and transition risks. 

  Limiting warming to 2.0 degrees appears to be the most plausible outcome. Reaching this goal will require significant policy measures and per capita emissions below the lowest level recorded since records began in 1960. 

  The physical effects of climate change are already evident in the form of heat and water stress, precipitation, storms, and rising sea levels. These effects will intensify regardless of collective action taken today to decarbonise.

  We are also from 2020 disclosing our progress on CO 2 efficiency in both actual efficiency (measured in EEOI, gCO 2 /ton-nm) as well as relative to our baseline year 2008. The graphs above show performance according to both the old calculation, used in our 2019 Sustainability Report, and the improved calculation which we will use going forward. 

  policies and changed consumption patterns. And a 2.0- degree pathway will entail ongoing material risk of accelerated climate change (tipping points) and abrupt policy changes in response. 

  Currently, the planet remains on an unsustainable warming pathway above 2.0 degrees and material physical climate change is likely regardless of remedial actions taken, impacting customer supply chains and potentially Maersk's ability to deliver a reliable product. 

  These scenarios confirm to us the urgency of climate action to mitigate the risks to our own business and stay relevant in the market by supporting our customers to decarbonise their supply chains. Climate change, more specifically the risk of not decarbonising our end-to-end supply chain at a speed that matches our customers’ and investors’ expectations, was in

  Comparing the new calculations with the old shows that while the number for actual efficiency in gCO 2 /ton-nm is now higher than before, this also corresponds to a higher reduction compared to the baseline year of 2008. Using the old methodology, we have reduced emissions by 42.7% since 2008. 

  greenhouse gas emissions across all scopes, our transition pathways, and climate-related risks and opportunities. 

  The key framework which guides our reporting is the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) framework which is also incorporated into CDP, a platform to which we have reported since 2010, and into new benchmarks such as the Climate Action 100+ net zero company benchmark launching in early 2021. 

  TCFD recommends that companies report on governance, strategy, risk management, and targets and metrics related to material climate- related risks and opportunities. To understand our governance of climate change work please refer to page 10 in this report.

  “We are looking for more robust and comparable information on how companies are realigning their business strategies and operations with the goals of the Paris Agreement and a net zero emissions future. We need to be certain that a company has charted a credible and comprehensive course to decarbonisation, taking into account added investments and costs, just as we need to know that the transformation is anchored at the highest leadership level.”

  The main contributors to the 2.5% reduction in 2020 are related to a series of energy efficiency initiative. Retrofitting of our fleet, the further integration and use of Star Connect and improved utilisation of vessels. 

  Star Connect is a monitoring system being implemented on all our vessels to provide visibility on the efficiency of the engine and the most effective sea voyage, with live data helping crews adjust and choose the most efficient path forward. We are also implementing a more limited version of the system on chartered vessels. 

  Further efficiency improvements are dependent on a continued and enhanced energy efficiency drive, different fuel types, more modern vessels and technological advances.

  and stakeholder demands, we are exploring ways in which we can work to include all emissions – our own, those related to the purchase of energy and those in our supply chain – in our decarbonisation efforts. 

  As the graphic below shows, the vast majority of our emissions come from our own operations (scope 1), which are dominated by ocean transport. As we expand our activities on land this situation is bound to change. However, our plan for expansion on land does not include significant asset ownership, and consequently emissions from our logistics supply chain (scope 3) are set to grow. 

  We are exploring how best to engage our suppliers in support of an end-to-end decarbonisation ambition, and we are working to expand our net zero solutions to customers to encompass offerings across end-to-end logistics, including trucking, rail and warehousing,

  as well as digital solutions to provide visibility on emissions end-to-end. 

  Our role in decarbonising logistics will be very different compared to our role in ocean transport, where Maersk holds a leadership position and is a significant asset owner in an industry dominated by relatively few, large companies. The inland logistics industry landscape is very different, and we typically have limited operational control of the assets such as trucks, trains, warehouses. This will imply a different, more collaborative, approach where we partner with our logistics suppliers to work towards decarbonisation of our end- to-end logistics offerings (scope 2 and scope 3, as well as the small portion of our scope 1 emissions outside ocean transport). 

  As part of this, we are working towards integrating environmental sustainability into procurement criteria in tenders.

  Responsible Procurement team carrying out

  Better oversight of contract labour in African ports 

  In 2020, we investigated working conditions for contracted labourers in ports on the African continent. We focused on ports where Maersk vessels call, but which are not owned by us. 

  This broader investigation was the result of unacceptable working conditions first reported by a Danish NGO in the port of Mombasa in 2019, which had found use 24-hour shifts with minimal breaks, to pay wages below the Kenyan hourly minimum wage and to lack provision of safety equipment for workers. This is not acceptable to us. 

  Comprehensive plan for the future Applying a customer perspective on responsible practices in our supply chain, we are developing a comprehensive work programme to deliver the necessary changes and improvements to our current practices across environmental, social and governance issues. 

  We will use the levers most readily available to us to create impact. That includes: • Strengthening our procurement digital landscape to enable the end-to-end supplier 

  performance monitoring. • Defining the ambition level for responsibility 

  and sustainability in our products. • Engaging our customers on risks in their 

  logistics supply chain. • Collaborating across the industry to set standards and share cost of driving improvements. 

  These efforts will also help us prepare both for our own operations and to support our customers to comply with upcoming regulation on mandatory social and environmental due diligence in various national jurisdictions and from the EU. We welcome legislation at the EU

  Local Maersk staff reviewed the practices of all the suppliers used for contracting labour in third-party operated ports in Africa and compared these to our supplier code of conduct. In most cases there were minor gaps which were addressed through improvement plans. 

  However, most of the contracted labourers working in these ports are hired by the port operators, and we have little insight into the content of their contracts. 

  Recognising that this is a high-risk area for ports, we are working to develop new audit and follow-up regimes to ensure our standards are met. 

  level, applying to all businesses above a certain size that have activities with in the EU, because this provides a far more level playing field. The opposite, which is further proliferation of national regulation, we believe will fall short of solving the problems it is designed to alleviate. 

  Going forward, we can leverage our experience from our extensive work on decarbonisation of and reducing air emissions from shipping. On these issues, Maersk has been instrumental in standard setting for CO 2 emissions, customer engagement through product development ahead of the market, and collaboration in alliances such as Clean Cargo, the Trident Alliance and the Getting to Zero coalition. Due to the fragmented nature of the logistics industry, we foresee a road to change consisting of many, comparatively smaller initiatives attacking the challenges bit by bit. 

  Wheels already in motion We have begun to take action in key areas. One example is the development of a collaborative approach to improve the monitoring of supplier compliance related to depot services, warehousing and trucking. This approach will be tested and rolled out globally in 2021, and sees our 

  MARKET

  due diligence in accordance with our Supplier Code of Conduct prior to the signing of a contract, while local Customer Experience and Health, Safety, Security and Environment teams carry out onsite audits for the duration of the contract. 

  Furthermore, in all land-based activities we have contracted labour hired through thirdparty providers. We are working to enhance our management of risks related to this workforce. Because while the companies responsible for these workers sign our Supplier Code of Conduct, we are not satisfied with our controls for compliance in areas such as health and safety, wages, social security or insurance and working hours. 

  Finally, while due diligence and onboarding procedures are already part of our Responsible Procurement programme, we are taking steps to strengthen post-contract monitoring and corrective measures. This will include increased audit activities, training suppliers of contracted labour on our standards and ways of working, and support tools for local management, including basic due diligence, non-compliance response options and an overview of potential risks. We expect these measures, including a pilot of 50 new audits per year, to be implemented within the next two years. 

  Read more about our core programmes on safety, responsible procurement, employee relations and anti-corruption in the responsible business practices section in this report. 

  Improving working conditions for truck drivers 

  We are active participants in the Responsible Trucking project run by CSR Europe, which focuses on enabling better working conditions for truck drivers in the EU. 

  In 2020, the project drafted a set of social guidelines that set out minimum standards, which serves as a public stance from private organisations in support of better working conditions for truck drivers, and at the same time addresses the specific challenges this profession faces. 

  Spot check tools and methodologies were also created for the group to use to understand the challenges on the ground, and for companies to have an indication of the extent to which these challenges are present in their own supply chain. 

  The guidelines will be published 2021, after which implementation of tools can begin.

  In March 2020, the executive leadership defined three priority focus areas to guide our response to the COVID-19 crisis

  sustained due to port activity have a positive impact throughout the surrounding communities. 

  Across the terminals, we applied procedures to mitigate the risk of contracting COVID-19. These included guidelines for the procedures that terminal and warehouse workers would have to adhere to before entering, while being in, and after leaving the workplace. This included training sessions and inspections of facilities to ensure safety for employees and other port and warehouse users. Furthermore, we outlined employee rights in case of quarantine or staying at home, and ensured visibility of these rights to

  Enabling global trade has been A.P. Moller - Maersk’s (Maersk) finest task for decades, but there was arguably never more pressure to keep goods moving freely than in 2020. In extraordinary circumstances, our employees across the world have gone to extraordinary lengths to serve customers in new and creative ways, while taking extra

  Protecting our people 

  “How are you? Is everyone safe?” This greeting became the standard opening comment in Maersk meetings in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic impacted where and how all our 80,000 employees in 130 countries worked and lived. 

  Alongside the threat to global health, the risk of collapsing economies with extensive job loss and shortage of goods grew fast as the

  all employees. 

  Serving our customers – and helping suppliers In addition to protecting our people, Maersk’s top priority during the crisis was to ensure that the global logistics chains continue to work, so that businesses and people can trust supply chains to do their job – first and foremost that medical supplies reach hospitals and food reaches kitchen tables, but also to minimise harm to our economies and livelihoods. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, global supply

  care of each other and helping society to get through the crisis. 

  “Being onboard for more than ten months was quite an experience. I had my holiday on board, celebrated my birthday as well, and never knew the next time I would go ashore. 

  It was all about waiting and hoping for possibilities to off-board, coming to terms with cancelled flights and changing schedules. In the meantime, we found ways to keep a positive attitude and break the monotony of the sleep-eat-work cycle. 

  What kept me going was the encouragement and bond of the crew, family calls made possible by the improved internet connectivity, drawing portraits and constant prayers. All of this made the physically challenging and mentally draining life on board with an overdue contract a little lighter.”

  pandemic progressed. While economies and individual livelihoods were widely impacted, global trade lanes and supply chains remained in service. Because of flexible supply chains and digital connectivity, countries and businesses were able to maintain essential services and supplies, even as half the global population was in lockdown. 

  Heroes trapped at sea At exactly 12:00 local time, on 1 May 2020, Maersk captains around the world tooted their horns in a celebration of the essential frontline workers who were keeping supply chains running – at sea, on the road, in ports, warehouses and factories across the world. 

  In Maersk, seafarers in particular were celebrated as “the unsung heroes of the COVID-19 pandemic”, as they continued to play an essential role in maintaining the flow of vital goods, such as food, fuels and medical supplies, that people everywhere need. 

  For many of our seafarers, the hero status was underlined by the fact that crews experienced prolonged stays on the same vessel, as crew changes were hindered by government restrictions. 

  Normally, a crew member stays on a vessel anywhere from two to six months. The Maritime Labour Convention states that crews can spend a maximum of 11 months on board. These norms were all broken in 2020. 

  Across the Maersk network, a total of 6,000 seafarers of 40 nationalities on 700 vessels work to ensure the flow of goods around the

  home, we gathered a cross-functional task force to create agreements with governments, airlines, airport operators, hotels and port authorities that would enable crews to obtain essential worker status to safely travel to and from major port hubs with major international airports, including on special Maersk charter flights. Moreover, an IT solution was put together to help track seafarer locations and maximise the number of people we could move, and procurement teams helped book over 100,000 hotel nights and 200,000 meals during the summer alone. 

  To overcome the multitude of bottlenecks we found on land, we created our own quarantine safe centres in strategic locations such as Manila and Mumbai where crew could be tested and certified as healthy to travel to join a vessel. We also created hubs for local quarantine in high-volume areas such as the Suez, Europe, Nigeria, Malaysia and Panama, which helped seafarers reach their destinations. 

  By the end of the year, we had succeeded in helping overdue crew members on or off vessels. 

  Safe employment on land More than 20,000 people work at the port terminals and inland facilities owned and operated by Maersk on six continents. Terminals play an important part in national and regional economies, first and foremost because they make sure goods flow to and from a country or region. In some countries, a Maersk-owned terminal is the only gateway to international

  chains have remained open: Our container ships continue to sail, our ports and warehouses continue to operate and trucks deliver goods to distribution and fulfilment centres. To take one example, despite more than half the global economy being under lockdown, the world has avoided major disruption in global food markets. 

  There are many examples of how our employees found new solutions to challenging supply chain problems. Read one in the box below. 

  Looking towards vaccines The next phase in the COVID-19 pandemic is now starting, as vaccines become ready for 

  Organising new exports to save products 

  On 24 March 2020, India came to a sudden standstill as Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a strict nation-wide lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. For Maersk and its customers, this meant a massive disruption of supply chains – trucks were abandoned by drivers rushing to get home, labourers stopped turning up at ports and yards, and customs house agents disappeared amid policy confusion. 

  Reliance Industries is the largest private company in India and a conglomerate spanning the energy, material, retail, entertainment and digital service sectors. Under the lockdown,

  large-scale distribution. Maersk began planning the logistics involved in this as early as the summer of 2020. 

  An important goal is to bring a vaccine to emerging and developing nations. To this end, COVAXX and Maersk established a global logistics partnership to distribute up to a billion doses of a COVAXX vaccine worldwide in 2021. As members of the World Economic Forum's Supply Chain & Transport Industry Action Group, we also endorsed a charter in support of globally inclusive, safe and sustainable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. The charter calls for engagement, asset, competency and expertise sharing, and support for UNICEF's distribution efforts. 

  Reliance saw local demand for its important polymers business fall to zero. Polymers are manufactured with a continuous process that is difficult to stop and restart, so Reliance needed to keep its factories open. 

  With over 15,000 containers worth of polymers and no warehousing space, Reliance’s only option was to shift from local businesses to exports. As road movement in India was halted in the early days of the lockdown, Maersk saw rail as an obvious solution for Reliance. However, local rail suppliers were not prepared to handle the unprecedented jump in volume from one train

  Applying disaster response expertise The Logistics Emergency Team, the disaster response partnership which Maersk has been an active member of since 2011, was activated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We received one request for deployment of a cold chain into South Sudan which will serve as storage for vaccines. We have placed three reefer containers with generator sets in a refugee centre, at a state hospital and the Ministry of Health, where they will serve as the backbone of a medical supply chain for ten million people. We are following this closely to assess whether it can be a scalable model for the global market at a later stage. 

  a week to 47 trains a week. Our team contacted eight different rail vendors and closed an agreement with them in 48 hours. 

  An even larger challenge was securing containers to move the polymers. The lockdown meant that import clearances were not taking place at a regular pace, and cargo inventory was building up in ports and yards. 15,000 40-foot containers were required for these exports – 10,000 of these were needed at Reliance’s Jamnagar, Gujarat plant alone. 

  To ensure an adequate number of containers, depots, terminals and carriers worked together to pool resources and flag any spare containers.

  Safety

  On Global Safety Day 2020, the crew on Svitzer Al Safliya discussed the risks, procedures and every day experiences of connecting and disconnecting towlines to and from vessels. The results were applied to improve best practices across the company.

  Tragic fire leads to new stowage system 

  The official investigation of a fire on board the Maersk Honam in March of 2018, where five seafarers tragically lost their lives, was finalised in 2020 by the Transport Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB) in Singapore. They concluded that the most likely source of the fire was a block of containers with declared dangerous cargo stowed inside a cargo hold in the forepart of the vessel. According to the report, the cause of the fire is not conclusive, but highly likely originated from the decomposition of dangerous cargo generating intense heat. 

  All cargo aboard Maersk Honam was accepted and stowed onboard the

  Why is it important Safety at work is a basic human right, and workplace conditions directly impact and influence workers as well as their families and communities. 

  Ambitions We want to protect our people, the environment and our business, eliminate fatalities and severe injuries, enable Maersk to be a preferred employer and provide safe and resilient products and services to our customers. 

  Targets 2020: • Top 300 leaders have completed Leading Safety Differently workshops. • Verification of effectiveness of critical controls. • Continuous improvement in employee engagement, measured through our Gallup survey.

  Keeping our people safe is a core value and an ethical responsibility for us as a company towards our employees, their families and communities. 

  2021: Leading-indicator targets for building safety capacity are set for: • Learning Team activity (to be completed within 40 days of every 

  High Potential Incident) • Leadership Gembas (to be carried out according to plan) • Critical risk projects (on-time and on-scope delivery)

  A.P. Moller - Maersk’s (Maersk) safety strategy is grounded in our Safety Differently philosophy, where the central premise is that safety is defined by having the capacity to manage risks under variable conditions. This must be enacted through leadership that engages with front-line employees and provides the support they need to make safe operations easier. 

  This philosophy is also evident in our safety targets, which do not highlight the absence of accidents, but rather the presence of leadership, that continuously engage with frontline employees to build capacity to eliminate as many as possible of the factors that contribute to the occurrence of accidents, and to manage the outcome of the accidents that still occur. We pursue the targets through activities in three tracks: engaging with workers, building capacity and promoting a learning culture. See 2020 progress on the next page. 

  Aligning standards everywhere Up until 2020, Maersk’s safety organisation was highly decentralised, which in some cases hindered the implementation of our safety strategy, and we have therefore reorganised our work to reinforce that Maersk has one, and only one, safety strategy, which is implemented and

  supply chain obligations in our hands, we have the capacity for safe operations in place. (Read more about sustainability in our end-to-end offerings on pp. 23-24). 

  Managing risks through learning teams Over the past two years, we completed a number of projects, based on identification of the most critical risks related to fatal and severe injuries across our operational contexts. These include cargo fires, warehousing operations, dropped objects, mooring operations, man overboard and working at height. 

  The risks were identified and solutions developed using a core element in the Safety Differently toolbox, namely the learning teams approach, where front-line workers share their experiences with leadership teams, allowing for a shared understanding of the risks and possible solutions, which can inform the allocation of resources and responsibility. In support of this approach, our port terminals organisation developed a leader-led programme, including an app that helps structure such learning conversations. By the end of 2020, there had been more than 36,000 recorded activities using the app since its launch in March 2020, and 4,831 times where unsafe work or

  vessel according to existing international guidelines and practices, which proved insufficient to prevent the loss of life and extensive damage caused by the fire. In response, we developed a risk-based stowage concept which divides each vessel into six different risk tolerance zones, and distributes the cargo in a way that ensures maximum fire resistance. 

  The system is now implemented on our entire fleet, both on the vessels we own and on those we charter. We are also working to enable a review and update of the international regulations of this area, in order to optimally protect all crew, cargo, environment and vessels. 

  rope breaks, it can move at over 800 km/ hour and snapback incidents can potentially cause severe injuries and fatalities. Through crew engagement, this risk was defined and a solution was developed. Now, Maersk has begun implementing a rope innovation called SnapBack Arrestor, where a broken mooring rope simply drops to the ground, instead of snapping back in unpredictable paths.

  Progress in 2020 A health, safety, security and environmental (HSSE) framework was developed throughout 2020 and launched early in 2021, aligning how safety processes and critical controls are implemented across all operations, including the allocation of core safety responsibilities and accountabilities of both employees and leaders of all levels across the business. 

  We have set targets and actively pursue progress within our focus areas. 

  Leadership • The majority of the planned Leading Safety Differently workshops had to be cancelled due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. However, 80 of our 

  targeted Top 300 leaders completed virtual sessions in 2020. • We designed a new leadership programme which we expect to launch in 2021. This consists of a toolkit for leaders to direct, lead and manage safety with easily accessible and inspiring content that is real and relevant to their role and will help them integrate it into their 

  daily business. • Roll-out and implementation of the Safety Leadership Gemba Guidance which helps reconnect leadership to the reality of everyday work and to learn from the frontline, continued during 2020. Despite COVID-19 restrictions, more than 28,000 Gemba activities could take place across the company. 

  Fatalities in 2020

  Building capacity • The collaborative approach to critical risk project management, where different parts of our company work together to uncover risks, create controls and evaluate and validate those, was integrated into the business. Results include risks related to mooring, crane operations, access to cargo areas and more, as well as a new vessel 

  inspection app. • Adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a virtual delivery solution for learning teams, which was tested late in 2020 and is being rolled-out in early 2021. 

  Culture • We see safety as a foundational contributor to employee engagement, and in line with our target the overall score in our 

  engagement survey improved throughout 2020. • The annual Global Safety Day had a somewhat smaller reach than in previous years due to COVID-19. Where possible, the day was celebrated under the theme ’Learning from each other’. This included more than 600 learning teams working on critical risks in their operations and on mental health and well-being, an area of great importance in 2020 due to the effects of COVID-19 on the well-being of our people. All learning collated from the frontline will inform the 2021 strategy and planning.

  We are proud of the progress made in Alang and are expanding our ambition to focus on creating opportunities for responsible ship recycling globally. 

  This situation is detrimental to the momentum

  yards voluntarily comply with the Hong Kong achieved at Alang over the past five years, as The Tove Maersk and MCC Halong undergoing responsible ship recycling at Y.S. Investments (Plot 59) in Alang, India – Sep ’20.

  Documented improvements In 2020 we conducted an impact study at yards engaged by A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk) in Alang to document the outcomes. Between 2017 and 2019, in line with the Responsible Ship Recycling Standard (RSRS), nine Maersk vessels were recycled at five different Alang yards under full-time supervision with stop-work authority and a verification regime through external audits. After 3,100 training sessions, 2,000 toolbox talks and 35 Lloyd's Register audits, not a single lost- time injury incident or fatality occurred. We have incentivised yards to invest in continual upgrades, which has also led to the construction of full impermeable floors in nine Maersk-approved yards and the purchase of 15 heavy-duty cranes in 11 yards that eliminate contact between vessel blocks the inter-tidal zone. There have been no major spills or incidents with hazardous materials on our projects at Maersk-engaged yards. 

  Appointment letters and payslips, minimum wages, overtime payments, annual health checks, a 24/7 ambulance dedicated to each yard and many more such facilities are now

  Convention, which is the only global convention on ship recycling. 

  Regulatory barriers to further progress However, at yards in Alang as well as among responsible shipowners, the frustration and concern today are almost palpable. International waste legislation, the Basel Ban Amendment (BBA) on export of hazardous waste adopted in 1995, entered into force on 5 Dec 2019, and may effectively hinder non-OECD countries such as India, from offering to recycle ships coming from OECD countries. This is particularly disappointing to the leading Alang yards, who have invested significant resources and engaged extensively with the European Commission over the past two years in order to comply with the EU Ship Recycling Regulation (EUSRR). These yards now comply with the EU regulation, except on a few solvable items related to waste management and access to hospitals with trauma facilities, and the yards were pending inclusion in the EU List, which lists global yards allowed to recycle vessels registered in EU countries.

  well as to the shipowners. We do not agree with the claims made that the BBA now supersedes the EUSRR and the IMO Hong Kong Convention (once it enters into force). Both the EU and IMO regulations offer equal levels of protection as the Basel Convention and general legal principles dictate the application of the specific legislation on ship recycling rather than the general provisions of waste handling. 

  Our position, based on thorough legislative analysis, is that there are legal options available to the EU and we are engaging with a multitude of stakeholders to find short- and long-term solutions to resolve this gridlock. 

  Changing our ambition A further challenge is the fact that in the next few years, globally a big wave of post-panamax vessels, (whose category name is derived from the fact that they are too large to pass through the Panama Canal), will near their end of life. Very few yards included in the EU List are capable of handling post-panamax vessels, and even fewer wish to accept these, with repairs/ conversions either being their core business or offshore/military vessel recycling their priority due to higher margins. Thus, there is today a lack of capacity for responsible recycling of mainstream, commercial, post-panamax vessels, regardless of which flag they sail under and where the responsible recycling facilities are located. 

  With proven results from Alang that engagement on the ground leads to change, we are confident that opportunities to remedy this situation can emerge from India and other non-OECD countries. Thus, Maersk's ambition for our work with responsible ship recycling has changed from radically transforming the industry beginning in Alang to focusing on creating opportunities globally. 

  We are in active dialogue with a few global greenfield projects, for example one in the African continent, where we as interested end-users assist in researching, developing the business

  Diversity and inclusion

  2020 was a year of increased focus on inclusion and non-discrimination in much of the world, with movements such as Black Lives Matter originating in the US, as well of new bursts of attention to LGBTQ+ rights and continued focus on #metoo around the world. 

  Our global presence means that we are affected by events and movements regardless of where they take place, and they impact us to take specific actions and provide input to A.P. Moller - Maersk’s (Maersk) continued, global conversation on diversity and inclusion. 

  Diversity and inclusion are part of our value system, and our support for social justice and anti-discrimination is also expected by our employees. In the North American part of our company, we took time to reflect on what discrimination means and how this impacts our teams. Conversation with our leaders began with virtual sessions focused on race discrimination, providing them with a framework to support discussions within their teams. We also ramped up our focus on allyship, where you work for change even if you are not personally affected by what you are aiming to change. This topic is not new to Maersk but we find that its importance to the diversity agenda is growing. 

  Containers sending a message 

  While we recognise the need for our company to work harder to improve on our own targets on diversity and inclusion, we also believe that symbolic statements can help create global awareness of fundamental rights. 

  In that vein, we have branded two Maersk containers in rainbow colours. They made their debut in Mobile, USA and are now travelling the

  Openness relies on psychological safety We have clear policies in place stating that we do not accept discrimination, and we have a whistleblower system with a range of options for our employees to communicate grievances. It can be daunting raising grievances on such sensitive issues and we want to do more to encourage our employees to speak up and report any concerns of harassment and or discrimination at Maersk. 

  We are doing this through increasing awareness and capability in building psychologically safe teams and cultures. We build this into our leadership programmes and provide separate virtual learning sessions available to all employees. 

  In 2021 we will be conducting our first global Inclusion survey that aims to increase our understanding on issues such as discrimination, harassment, diversity and inclusion. The results from the survey will be used to focus our priorities going forward. We have taken the decision to set up an ombuds office to specifically hear out grievances that employees do not feel comfortable reporting to human resources departments, line managers or posting to the whistleblower system.

  Unconscious bias work continues Our initiatives on diversity and inclusion support our drive towards targets on gender and nationality representation in management. Our key approach is employee engagement and capability building, and over the past three years, we have worked on creating awareness of unconscious bias and related effects, establishing inclusion networks covering our global organisation. 

  As is the case for race, gender, beliefs, disabilities and more, it is a basic human right not to be discriminated against due to one's sexual orientation. In support of human rights, we have participated in Pride activities since 2018. 

  2020 saw our planned Pride celebrations move to a virtual platform and we used this opportunity to reflect on the history and evolution of Pride, among other things through a series of global webinars to understand its journey and essence: the ability to freely and safely express oneself. This also allowed us to address the racial conversations that were dominating societies around the world and the importance of talking about racism as well as where we stand as a company.

  Why is it important 

  It is a basic obligation and a core element of our values not to discriminate against our employees. Discrimination bars people from living up to their full potential, creates inequality and less stable and prosperous societies. We also want to leverage 

  Ambitions 

  We aspire to create an inclusive culture where all employees can have a sense of belonging and contribute to their fullest. In doing this, we will be in a prime position to attract people from the widest talent pool, specifically increasing the gender and nationality diversity at our senior levels. 

  Targets 

  Our target is to have three women on the Board of Directors, if the Board consists of less than twelve members, and four women, if the Board consists of twelve or more members. 

  Progress in 2020 

  The target for representation of women on the A.P. Moller - Maersk Board of Directors was met in 2020 10 . However, we are still not satisfied with the progress we have made towards our nominal targets on gender and national representation in senior management. We are implementing new controls and processes to drive improvements, and during 2021, we will set and share updated targets for the period from 2021 - 2025. 

  Our progress on women in management is adversely impacted by the fact that the share of women working in logistics and technology – which are areas in which we recruit many candidates –

  the competitive advantage that diverse teams and inclusive cultures can bring to our business, and meet our employees' demand for working in a company that values diversity and inclusion. 

  For senior management, we have targets for representation of women and nationalities (see side bar). 

  is very low. In January 2020, we joined an initiative hosted by the Danish Shipping Association focused on attracting more women to shipping and logistics, and we have established a women’s network in our global technology function. 

  As part of our global maternity policy, we have a target of reaching a 90% retention rate for women returning to work after maternity leave. In 2020, this was the case for 74% of the target group. Maersk's gender diversity and inclusion policy provides details of our actions to increase gender diversity. It is available on Maersk's website 11 .

  One example is that we introduced a new way to engage management teams in our terminal business in working pro-actively with employee relations. We mapped the potential risks and level of maturity in managing employee relations in all terminals, with indicators such as the level of stability of political, social and environmental issues in the community and the frequency of communication between management and employee representatives. The goal is to build maturity in these relationships including a vision and strategy for each terminal on employee relations. 

  In 2020, the whistleblower hotline was used 143 times to report on issues related to potential violations of HR-related laws, rules or company values. 17 of these cases were substantiated, 11 of which were related to the Commit Rule on Global Employee Relations.

  Air emissions 

  Why is it important

  Reducing

  Ocean health 

  Why is it important

  Expanding our

  Air emissions from ocean-going shipping have negative effects on human health and the natural environment, as they cause diseases and premature death. 

  Ambitions To continue to be an industry leader working towards reducing air emissions from international shipping, particularly in regard to SOx and NOx emissions, which are important in port areas and when sailing close to shore. 

  Targets • Fully comply with regulatory demands to reduce air emissions impacts and continue investing in maintaining and implementing solutions that will enable this. 

  Progress in 2020 

  Across A.P. Moller - Maersk's (Maersk) activities, we strive to minimise the known negative impacts related to our operations. This is also true for air emissions which include SOx, NOx and particulate matters. All of these are potentially harmful to human health and we work to fully comply with regulatory demands to limit air emissions and strive to minimise the impacts. 

  On 1 January, one of the largest changes in the maritime industry in decades came into effect with the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 0.5% global cap on the content of sulphur in fuels. One of the enforcement mechanisms for this legislation is a ban on carrying non-compliant fuels on vessels, except for vessels where scrubbers are installed to clean exhaust gasses. Mainly due to the IMO 2020 sulphur cap, which Maersk complies with through the use of low sulphur fuels as well as scrubbers on a share of our vessels, SOx emissions have dropped significantly from approx. 569,000 tonnes in 2019 to approx. 102,000 tonnes in 2020. 

  Thorough preparations in the years leading up to this date ensured a successful switch from heavy fuel oil to low sulphur fuels across our fleet of both owned and chartered vessels. In 2020, we saw only four cases of non-compliance with international sulphur regulations caused by contamination in the supply chain of oil or by human error. As a remedial action, we have begun testing sulphur content of the fuel prior to bunkering.

  We support regulation such as the cap on sulphur content in fuel oil, which will significantly reduce these effects and create a level playing field for socially and environmentally responsible practices in the industry. 

  • Actively engage at international and regional levels to secure a level playing field and high levels of enforcement of regulation across the industry. 

  The main concern in the years leading up to the cap taking effect was uneven enforcement, as it was estimated that a large container vessel could save around USD 750,000 sailing from a port in Asia to a port in Europe when using non-compliant 3.5% marine fuel instead of compliant 0.5% fuel. 

  While the level of control is not always as stringent as we would have hoped for, we have received no indication that compliance is lacking. Looking at which oil types are sold on the global market is a useful proxy for evaluating compliance, and it appears that the low-sulphur fuel uptake is at the expected level. However, it should also be noted that due to COVID-19, port state controls have been made more difficult. We therefore hope that enforcement campaigns can resume in 2021. 

  The use of scrubbers to clean the vessels' exhaust of SOx remains a discussion point and no independent global survey of the effects of scrubbers has yet been produced to support global legislation. Still, more national and regional legislation is being implemented, for example in the EU, some US states and Australia, requiring vessels to shut off the scrubber system when entering near-coastal waters and switch to low-sulphur oil. As a result, more ports are expected to declare a ban of open-loop scrubbers. 

  Maersk has installed open-loop scrubbers on a share of our vessels as a commercial risk management measure.

  the impact of SOx 

  Research has shown that the annual, ship-related global health impacts from using fuel with 3.5% sulphur instead of 0.5% fuel are 137,000 premature deaths 7 million childhood asthma cases 13 

  This is the driver behind the IMO's legislation on SOx, which from 2020 requires the entire global fleet to sail on fuels with 0.5% sulphur content 

  The compliance measures approved by the IMO are Carrying and using only low- sulphur fuels on vessels 

  Installing scrubbers to clean vessels' exhaust 

  Enforcement of the legislation is critical. On just one voyage from Asia to Europe a large container vessel could save up to USD 750,000 by using non- compliant fuel.

  The global oceans redistribute CO 2 and heat, supply people and communities with food, water, renewable energy, and build livelihoods through tourism, trade and transport. The health of 

  Ambitions 

  We see ourselves as citizens of the oceans and we are committed to doing no harm while at the same time actively participating in restoring ocean health and resilience and protecting animal habitats. 

  Targets 

  • Zero non-contained oil spills above 10 m³. • Fully comply with rules and regulations to minimise negative impact on ocean health, including waste management and ballast water systems 

  Progress in 2020 

  Our first obligation as citizens of the oceans is to comply with rules and regulations that safeguard ocean health. For A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk), this includes managing fuels or chemical substances to avoid spills into water, managing waste to keep it out of the oceans and living up to the regulation on ballast water. We have policies and procedures to manage and mitigate all these risks. 

  In 2020, there were two non-contained spills. One spill to land in our terminal business in The Netherlands (19 m 3 ) and one spill to water relating to Maersk Supply Service and resulting from a mud spill (20.3 m 3 ). 

  Dumping waste at sea contributes to the ailing health of oceans and the biodiversity crisis. Maersk has a zero-dumping policy, obligating all vessels to store waste and discard it when in a port with adequate facilities. We are challenged by a lack of capacity in qualified waste reception facilities at ports internationally. We have mapped and vetted facilities to enable our vessels to plan around the gaps, but our operations would be more efficient with proper facilities available. 

  Also affecting the health of oceans and biodiversity is how vessels handle ballast water. This is often added in one marine environment to keep the vessel stable and safe, and later discharged in another environment due to changes in cargo. This may result in invasive species disturbing local ecosystems. The Ballast Water Management Convention (BWMC) obligates shipowner to have ballast water systems installed on all vessels by 2024.

  the ocean is rapidly deteriorating due to increasing temperatures, acidification, depletion of natural resources and pollution from land and sea, including large quantities of plastic waste. 

  • Continue collaboration with The Ocean Cleanup. • Support ocean science research through data collection and partnerships. 

  comply with this demand. We saw no non- compliances with existing regulation. All marine life from plankton to whales reacts to noise, and for this reason the increase in underwater noise from human activity is of growing concern. One example of this is how ship noise impacts and confuses the communication of an endangered species of orca whales. A positive bi-product of some of our energy efficiency retrofits of vessels is that the level of ship noise is lowered. We sail at slower speeds in areas where these whales have been identified. 

  Collaborating for ocean health Weather and sea state observations from vessels at sea provide data on meteorological conditions for weather forecasts, help climate scientists understand climate change, and help to protect life and property on vessels by allowing better forecasting of storms and other extreme ocean- related events. In 2020, we agreed to commit our fleet of 300 owned vessels to be part of the global Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) scheme, run by the World Meteorological Organization and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO. By mid-year 2021, we will have finalised installation of fully automated weather stations on 50 vessels. 

  We have also contributed to the UN Global Compact's guidance for the shipping industry to support implementation of the Sustainable Ocean Principles, which we participated in establishing

  support for The Ocean Cleanup 

  Since 2018, Maersk has been proud to partner with The Ocean Cleanup, providing offshore support for their plastic waste cleanup system in the Pacific Ocean. A new, three-year partnership agreement was established during 2020. It expands the collaboration to include both maritime and end-to-end logistics services, in line with the anticipated scale-up of The Ocean Cleanup's ocean activities as well as the expansion to include systems deployed in large rivers. 

  Maersk's assistance will range from shipping, customs clearance and warehouse and storage management. 

  On the offshore side, in addition to deployment services, Maersk will contribute to developing a more sustainable maritime approach with alternative fuels and new fleet design. Maersk’s support is provided as full or partial donations, or on favourable terms. 

  The Ocean Cleanup’s goal is to reach a 90% reduction of floating ocean plastic by 2050. This is an important issue to many of our seafarers as well as to colleagues on land, and in 2020 we ran a campaign encouraging employees and teams to become Ocean Ambassadors, take local initiatives and share their efforts to clean up beaches and their environment. Despite COVID-19 restrictions, we saw around 80 team contributions from around the world.

  Corruption undermines social and economic development. It destabilises the business environment and adds to the cost of participating in global trade. It affects external confidence as well as company morale. Non-compliance with legislation 

  Ambitions 

  We aim to eliminate corruption in the industries where we are active through both multistakeholder collaboration and actions in our own operations. 

  Targets 

  Comply with legislation on anti-corruption practices, which ultimately translates to zero bribery and elimination of facilitation payments. 

  Progress in 2020 

  The risk of corruption in our ocean business relates primarily to interactions with authorities in ports and at border controls, and mostly as facilitation payments. In our terminals, the risk is greatest when negotiating government agreements on concessions. Risks on land and in our supply chain are predominantly managed through our Responsible Procurement programme. 

  We work to combat bribery, fraud, kickbacks and preferential treatment by performing due diligence of agents, joint venture partners, key suppliers, and M&A targets prior to signing a contract or entering a new market. Expectations to employees are outlined in the A.P. Moller - Maersk (Maersk) Code of Conduct and the Maersk Anti-Corruption policies and guidelines. We enforce rules on travel, meals, lodging, gifts, amenities and entertainment, and employees complete annual training on compliance. Our current compliance programme is based on guidelines for complying with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 

  We work on projects focused on risk-based mitigation measures, e.g. in-person training, transaction testing, spot checks and appointment of business compliance ambassadors, strengthening our internal compliance controls framework as well as rolling out a conflict-of-interest policy. Executive commitment through words and actions has helped set the tone for the rest of the company. 

  One top priority in 2020 was finalising the implementation of the Maersk third-party management process, which in this structured form is a new

  on bribery and corruption may lead to legal and reputational risks, extra costs, inefficiencies in our business, fines, imprisonment and ultimately debarment from markets. 

  addition to our controls. Read more about this in the side bar. 

  In 2020, we registered five minor incidents of facilitation payments on own vessels, and reduced payments on chartered vessels by a further 39% compared to 2019. 

  We are investigating how we will address facilitation payments in ports and in the inland logistics and are among other things conducting a pilot study in Southeast Asia to map and understand where the money originates and how it travels through systems and processes. We will be scaling up this project to develop a global approach to this issue, just as we will continue to collaborate with the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network on this and other projects. 

  Of the channels used for reporting, the whistleblower hotline was used in twelve instances to report on public sector corruption cases. So far, none of the cases have substantiated while three cases are still under investigation. 

  In December 2020, the Brazilian authorities filed a civil lawsuit against A.P. Moller - Maersk A/S and other Maersk group entities related to allegations that a third-party broker made improper payments in connection with certain tanker charter party agreements entered into with Petrobras between 2008 and 2010. We remain committed to cooperating with the authorities, but cannot publicly comment on ongoing litigation.

  on our behalf 

  Working through third parties is a known corruption risk to our business. To improve risk mitigation, we have invested in a third-party management system, and in 2020 we developed and initiated the roll-out of a structured risk-based third- party management process across Maersk. 

  In the first year of operations, 1200 leaders and employees have been trained 250 third parties have been or are being processed 5 third-party engagements were avoided or stopped on ethical grounds 

  Through this process, we select the third parties best suited for our business based on their competence, integrity, and other relevant capabilities. We also have a process for comprehensive due diligence on acquisition targets, joint venture partners and shareholders through which we reviewed 60 potential partners in 2020, as well as created a process for timely and orderly integration of the acquired entity into existing compliance programme structures.

  Well-functioning tax systems locally and internationally help finance education, infrastructure and other public services that support sustainable development, local societies, business and trade. 

  Ambitions 

  Be a compliant and accountable taxpayer with responsible and transparent tax practices. 

  Targets 

  • Ensure full compliance with tax regulations in all countries 

  where we operate. • Continue to engage in dialogue with stakeholders on tax matters. 

  Progress in 2020 

  A.P. Moller - Maersk's (Maersk) total tax charge in 2020 was 407 million USD, compared to 458 million in 2019. See the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Annual Report 2020 for more details. 

  We continue our dialogue with stakeholders including the B Team, learning and sharing best practices with other companies who have also endorsed the B Team's Tax Principles. 

  We are in the process of updating the Maersk Tax Principles, providing more relevant information to our stakeholders and explaining the different tax rules, under which Maersk operates. In particular, how our shipping activities are taxed under the tonnage tax regime. This is a methodology using vessel tonnage to determine the taxable income on which corporate tax is paid. As a result, liner entities are not taxed on actual commercial profit or loss. As our business grows on land, more of our income will be taxed according to regular corporate tax rules and based on actual profit. 

  As part of our updated Maersk Tax Principles we will be disclosing tax payments, in accordance with the OECD Country by Country Reporting (CBCR) principles, for the largest taxpaying countries per region. We have

  We recognise the need for companies to support the local economies in which they do business. 

  • Implement the B-Team Responsible Tax Principles with reporting for 2020. 

  chosen this disclosure approach to achieve the right balance between our support for additional transparency on corporate tax and ensuring the relevance of the disclosed information. 

  Our updated Maersk Tax Principles and CBCR tax payments will be available on the Maersk.com website in Q2 2021, when the 2020 CBCR tax numbers are available. 

  The EU list of noncooperative tax authorities for 2020 comprises twelve countries, of which Maersk has activities in four: Due to a prior year adjustment, in Panama we paid USD 781,000 in taxes on a profit of USD 460,000, in the US Virgin Islands we paid USD 743,000 in taxes on a profit of USD 1,531,000 and in Barbados we paid USD 15,000 in taxes on a profit of USD 477,000. We have very minor profits (less than USD 1,000) and tax payments in Trinidad and Tobago. 

  In December 2020, as per the deadline for 2019 CBCR tax numbers, we disclosed full country by country reporting to the Danish tax authorities in accordance with our legal obligations.

  Progress 2020

  TradeLens integrated with over 220 organisations, including ocean carriers and ports and terminals, resulting in access to half of the world's ocean container cargo. Two pilots planned in multi-stakeholder project to automate advance sea cargo data for developing countries. Over 4,000 active Twill customers, and almost 1,700 participants in Twill webinars and coaching programmes. Invested in 21 start-ups enabling trade for SMEs, reaching more than 15,000 customers. Contributed to trade facilitation reforms in 10 countries. Cold Chain Logistics business serving several hundred customers across nearly 50 countries.

  Based on a strategic review of global climate scenarios and transition pathways, decarbonisation was established as a strategic imperative for the company, and a dedicated function was created to accelerate progress. Reduced CO₂ emissions by 46.3% since 2008, with 2.5% achieved in 2020. Maersk ECO Delivery sales exceeded expectations. Continued research on priority future fuels (biodiesel, methanol, lignin fuels and ammonia) confirming that net-zero technologies are available. Maersk will not use transition fuels (such as LNG) but leapfrog to fully net-zero fuels. Worked with customers, partners and regulators to build the market, fuel supply chains and policy frameworks to support net-zero emissions shipping.

  All targets affected by COVID-19. Educated 80 company leaders on Safety Differently, and designed a new leadership programme for launch in 2021. Integrated collaborative approach to critical risk project management across the organisation and progressed on critical risk projects. Developed virtual delivery solution for learning teams, for roll-out in early 2021. Carried out annual Global Safety Day under the theme 'Learning from each other'.

  Three vessels sent for RSRS- compliant recycling to Alang yards in India and one for EUSRR- and RSRS-compliant recycling to an Aliaga yard in Turkey. For audit results, see p. 33. Continued advocacy in the EU to advance inclusion of compliant Alang yards on the EU List, among other things through the results of an impact study of our activities in Alang. Contributed data and information to the Ship Recycling Transparency Initiative. Continued support for medical outreach in wider Alang including support for COVID-19 response in the community.

  Target for women on Board of Directors met. Targets for management representation were not achieved. Revised targets for 2021 and onwards will be launched later in 2021. Conducted psychological safety-webinars across the organisation. Work on unconscious bias continued. Establishing inclusion networks covering our global organisation. 2020 saw our planned virtual pride celebrations move to a virtual platform.

  Built processes to ensure health and safety for employees despite COVID-19. Progressed in enhanced management of risks in relation to third-party workers. 143 cases related to potential violation of HR-related laws, rules or company values were processed through our whistleblower system. 17 of these cases were substantiated, 11 of which were related to the Commit Rule on Global Employee Relations.

  Audits and subsequent improvement plans affected by COVID-19. Groundwork for integration of responsible procurement in end-to-end product offerings laid, focusing on third-party workers, minimum standards for truckers in the EU, and strengthening post-audit compliance in collaboration with local HSSE functions.

  Successfully implemented shift to low-sulphur fuels across our owned fleet. Registered four non-compliances with international sulphur regulations caused by contamination in the oil supply chain or by human error. SOx emissions significantly reduced to approx. 102,000 tonnes mainly as a result of the IMO2020 sulphur cap.

  Progressed in line with plans for compliance with IMO Ballast Water Management Convention. Partnership with the Ocean Cleanup Project extended to 2023. Supported science with commitment of our entire fleet of 300 owned vessels to be part of the global Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) scheme to collect meteorological data at sea. Two non-contained spills: One spill to land in our terminal business in The Netherlands (19 m 3 ) and one spill to water relating to Maersk Supply Service and resulting from a mud spill (20.3 m 3 ).

  Five minor facilitation payments on our own vessels in 2020 and a further 39% reduction of facilitation payments on chartered vessels since 2019. Finalised the implementation of the Maersk third-party management process, including training of 1200 employees, processing of 250 third parties and termination or avoidance of 5 third party engagements. 12 cases related to public sector corruption processed through our whistleblower system of which none were substantiated.

  46 A.P. Moller - Maersk Sustainability Report 2020 47

  Sustainability accounting principles

  We report on relative CO₂ emissions reduction using EEOI (Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator) methodology. EEOI is defined by IMO in MEPC.1/ Circ.684 and is calculated as gCO₂/(Ton cargo x Nm). 

  In practice we calculate EEOI on voyage level and aggregate it in the following way:

  sea/truck/ rail). This means that e.g. trucking only includes carrier haulage. Category 11 - use of sold products, which is reported based on sale of used containers and vessel recycling. The method includes splitting the product into waste categories and waste treatment type based on category and region.

  injury which results in the complete loss, or permanent loss of use, of any member or part of the body, or any impairment of functions of parts of the body, regardless of any pre-existing disability of the injured member or impaired body function. Permanent Total Disability (PTD) is any work injury which incapacitates

  Reporting framework A.P. Moller - Maersk does not apply a specific overall reporting framework but uses the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines as guidance to determine report content and quality in terms of materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, completeness, balance, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity and reliability. 

  Reporting period Our reporting covers the period from 1 January to 31 December 2020. 

  Controls While data regarding number of employees, women in leadership, gender and target nationalities are generated from our HR systems, data regarding accidents, fatalities, exposure hours, energy consumption, waste, water and spills are reported through our consolidated reporting tool based on submitted data from all reporting entities within A.P. Moller - Maersk. This tool is validated via internal audit, with manuals and online training in place. A set of generally accepted accounting principles for sustainability has been established, which defines the reporting rules, processes and responsibilities. A controlling guideline has been distributed to help secure the businesses' own assurance of submitted data, before sign-off by the respective CEOs and CFOs. Furthermore, all businesses are obliged to provide explanation sheets on significant data developments. The data reported under financial scope is included in the framework used to assure risks and controls for financial reporting (Danish Statements Act §107b, section 1, no 6). 

  Scope Operational scope is applied for safety and spills data when A.P. Moller - Maersk or one of its subsidiaries has the governing authority and responsibility for health, safety and environmental management of the people, processes and facility – either directly or indirectly via third-party contractual arrangements. This approach excludes data from assets that are partly owned by A.P. Moller - Maersk but operated by another company. Mobile assets are included when operated by A.P. Moller - Maersk. For vessels, the International Safety Management Code Document of Compliance must be held by A.P. Moller - Maersk to include the data.

  Financial scope is applied for all other sustainability data, and is defined as follows: • Owned assets and leased in assets that A.P. Moller - Maersk uses: A.P. Moller - Maersk is liable for consumption, emissions and other 

  environmental elements • Owned assets that are leased out: A.P. Moller - Maersk is not liable for consumption, emissions and other environmental elements – the lessee is. 

  Technical management of an asset on behalf of third parties does not change the responsibility. Thus, consumption and emissions still belong to the asset owner/lessee who uses the asset. 

  With regard to greenhouse gases, the reporting must be in accordance with the GHG Protocol: direct emissions from own assets (Scope 1), indirect emissions from purchased electricity and district heating (Scope 2), and value chain emissions across material categories (Scope 3). 

  Diversity and inclusion data includes all brands, global service centres, corporate functions, and Boards. Joint ventures are out of scope. Gender and nationality data, which includes women in leadership, gender – female/total, target nationalities in leadership, target nationalities/ total, is reported by headcount and extracted from SAP HR along with manual inputs of data not recorded in SAP HR. 

  Comparability In line with the business strategy and organizational integration of A.P. Moller - Maersk, we report on sustainability performance as One Maersk. For Maersk Drilling and Maersk Oil sustainability data is not included in the year of separation from A.P. Moller - Maersk, while economic performance data is included up to the data of the demerger/ sale. Acquired and merged entities are excluded from sustainability reporting until the following reporting year. 

  Consolidation For operational scope, 100% of the data reported from the operated assets is included irrespective of percentage ownership. Financial scope uses our financial consolidation methodology; data is collected per legal entity per activity, and the figures are consolidated line-by-line. Subsidiaries in which A.P. Moller - Maersk has full control are included 100%. Joint ventures and associated companies and other companies, in which A.P. Moller - Maersk does not have control,

  are excluded. Using financial consolidation principles allows us to compare sustainability indicators directly with financial data, thereby providing context for our performance. 

  Data categories and accuracy A.P. Moller - Maersk has defined two categories of data: documented and probable data: • Documented data comprises: our employees (FTE), energy consumption, air emissions, 

  transport work (for EEOI), and financial data • Probable data comprises: safety (fatalities and LTIf), waste, water, spills, gender and nationality. 

  Documented data (financial and non-financial) is valid and complete and is essentially at the same quality level. 

  The reliability of probable data is somewhat lower but is still provided to the best of the management’s knowledge. It is based on data received and controlled in the consolidated reporting tool, but with an inherent risk of being incomplete. 

  Financially scoped probable data (water and waste) must always be defendable, and if assumptions are necessary due to lack of documentation, then the assumptions made must be verifiable. If no evidence exists, then assumptions based on the probable data must be made in writing and shall be verified by the reviewer, whereby the data are always defendable. 

  Operationally scoped probable data (safety and spills data), along with gender and nationality, has the weakest data quality, as it is not possible to ensure validity and completeness. 

  Emission conversions and calculations GHG emissions are calculated indirectly via default conversion factors for energy consumption and other GHG gases. 

  Primary schemes used are API (updated 2009), DEFRA (updated 2020) and IEA (updated 2020). The principles for choosing among the schemes for default conversion factors are: • Newest schemes are preferred, as are 

  internationally recognised generic schemes • A scheme must always be used in full. Thus, no combined schemes are allowed unless specific elements were not included 

  in the primary scheme • Specific industry schemes can be included when not in conflict with the above.

  

  (g CO 2 voy1 + g CO 2 voy2 + g CO 2 voy3) ((Ton cargo x Nm)voy 1+ (Ton cargo x Nm)voy 2+ (Ton cargo x Nm)voy 3) 

  The data sources are: 1. g CO₂ – Based on fuel consumption, from departure voyage 1, to departure voyage 2, multiplied with relevant CO₂ factor (3.114 for 

  HFO, 3.206 for MDO). 2. Ton cargo – Calculated via draft and displacement tables, subtracting vessel weight 

  and ballast water and fuel stock. 3. Nm – GPS distance from departure voyage 1, to departure voyage 2. 

  In 2020, the baseline for EEOI has been recalculated to include missing data points for historical performance. 

  From 2020, scope 2 emissions are reported in two ways: location-based and market-based. For the latter, market-based factors are used for EU countries and the U.S. while IEA factors are used for other countries. 

  From 2020, scope 3 emissions are reported in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Of the 15 scope 3 categories in the Protocol only nine categories are deemed relevant for our business activities. The excluded categories, Cat. 8 upstream leased assets, Cat. 9 downstream transportation and distribution, Cat. 10 processing of sold products, Cat. 13 downstream leased assets, Cat. 14 franchises and Cat 15 investment, were determined not to have significant relevance to Maersk’s business model. From a reporting perspective we have furthermore decided to apply a materiality threshold of 1% of the total scope 3 emissions which excludes the following categories from reporting: Cat 5. waste generated in operations, Cat. 6 business travel, Cat. 7 employee commuting, and Cat. 12 end of life treatment of sold products. 

  Scope 3 reporting thus comprises five remaining categories: Cat. 1 - purchased goods and services, which is reported based on procurement data and includes OPEX goods. Cat. 2 - capital goods, which is reported based on procurement data and includes our capital investments such as e.g. retrofit of vessels and dry docking. We include the full scope 3 impact the first year of a CAPEX investment. Category 3 - fuel and energy related activities, which is reported based on actual fuel procured and consumed. Category 4 - upstream transportation and distribution, which is reported based on procurement data multiplied by relevant emission factor per transportation category (air/

  

  When preparing our scope 3 emissions in the material categories listed above, we have provided procurement and accounting data to an external service provider, which has then applied our data in their model for calculating related carbon emissions. The scope 3 emissions data returned to us by the external service provider have then been entered into our reporting. The scope 3 emissions stated have not been subject to review by our assurance provider PwC. 

  For categories 1 and 2 data for Maersk Supply Service is not included due to data compatibility. Category 4 excludes when customers arrange their own transport as no data in this case is available for Maersk to reasonably accurately calculate scope 3 impact. 

  Definitions: • Number of employees is the average number of full-time equivalents (FTEs). FTEs are calculated based on the total number of compensable hours (days) in a work year compared to the number of hours (days) in a ‘norm’ work year. Excluded are employees on unpaid leave, 

  contractors and temporary staff. • Headcounts are defined as regular employees not on leave, on paid leave and on unpaid leave. 

  Excluded are contractors and temporary staff. • Women in leadership is the percentage of women in level 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, corresponding to Senior Managers, Leaders, Senior Leaders, and Executives, compared to total headcount of the 

  same levels. • Gender – female over total is the percentage of 

  women employed based on headcount. • Target nationalities in leadership is the percentage of leaders with non-high-income OECD nationalities in level 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, corresponding to Senior Managers, Leaders, Senior Leaders, and Executives, compared to 

  total headcount of the same levels. • Fatalities is the headcount number of accidents 

  leading to the death of the employee. • LTIf (Lost-Time Injury frequency) measures the number of lost-time injuries per million exposure hours. Lost-time injuries (LTI) is the sum of fatalities, permanent total disability (PTD), permanent partial disability (PDD) and lost work day case (LWC). A Lost Workday Case (LWC) is any work-related injury, other than a fatal injury, which results in a person being unfit for work on any day or shift after the day of occurrence of the occupational injury. Permanent Partial Disability (PDD) is any work

  an employee permanently and results in termination of employment on medical grounds. Excluded from LTIs are suicide or attempted suicide, criminal or terrorist activity, and incidents which occur off the ship but where the 

  consequences appear onboard at some later time. • Energy consumption encompasses fuel oil, gas fuels, other fuels (diesel, gasoline, kerosene, and heating oil), and biofuel as well as the consumption of electricity / district heating and 

  renewable energy. • Renewable technologies, from which energy is derived to use for electricity or heating, include 

  solar panels, wind turbines, biomass and batteries. • Direct GHG (scope 1) is the sum of all six Kyoto gasses converted to CO₂ equivalents. Kyoto gasses comprise: CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O, which are calculated based on fuel consumption/ combustion, and HFC, SF₆, NF₃ and HCFC, which 

  are based on direct consumption. • Indirect GHG (scope 2) is the CO₂ equivalents’ converted sum of CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O, calculated on consumed electricity and district heating bought from a third party. Scope 2 emissions are reported using location-based emission factors, and using market-based factors (see 'Emissions 

  conversions and calculations'). • Value chain GHG (scope 3) is calculated on procurement and accounting data and covers all 

  six main greenhouse gases. • Other air emissions include SOx and NOx, which both are calculated based on fuels consumed multiplied by generally accepted conversion factors for the respective fuels. In case of scrubber use, SOx emissions are reported based on Clean Cargo guidelines, where SOx output is assumed to be maximum for the operating area 

  in which the vessel spends 80% of time. • Amount of waste is the sum of all waste 

  types generated. • Amount of water is the sum of all water consumed, excluding ballast water and water 

  for re-injection. • Uncontained spills over 10 m 3 are defined as any type of spills of hydrocarbon liquids greater than ten m³, resulting from any unintended, irreversible release associated with current 

  operations. • To secure completeness, office standards have been developed based on 2020 data, which can be used for offices with no production or warehousing, etc. These standards are only to be used if other more accurate information is not available.

  Independent assurance report Stay up to date

  To the stakeholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S We value your feedback

  A. P. Møller - Mærsk A/S engaged us to provide limited assurance on the Performance data stated on page 44 in the Sustainability Report of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S for the period January 1 – 31 December 2020 (the "Performance data"). 

  Our conclusion Based on the procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained, nothing came to our attention that causes us not to believe that the Performance data in the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report are free of material misstatements and prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Principles as stated on pages 46-47 (the *Sustainability Accounting Principles”). 

  This conclusion is to be read in the context of what we state in the remainder of our report. 

  What we are assuring The scope of our work was limited to assurance over Performance data as stated on page 44 in the A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report 2020. Scope 3 carbon emissions have not been in scope for our review of the 2020 Performance data.

  accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our work was carried out by an independent multidisciplinary team with experience in sustainability reporting and assurance. 

  Understanding reporting and measurement methodologies The Performance data need to be read and understood together with the Sustainability Accounting Principles on pages 46-47, which Management are solely responsible for selecting and applying. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time. 

  Work performed We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Performance data. In doing so and based on our professional judgement, we:

  in the 2020 A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S Sustainability Report and, in doing so, considered whether the other sustainability information is materially inconsistent with the Performance data or our knowledge obtained in the review or otherwise appear to be materially misstated. We have nothing to report in this regard. 

  Management’s responsibilities Management of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S is responsible for: • Designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation of the Performance data and information in the Sustainability Report that are free from material 

  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; • Establishing objective Sustainability Accounting 

  Principles for preparing Performance data; and • Measuring and reporting the Performance data in the Sustainability Report based on the Sustainability Accounting Principles. 

  Our responsibility We are responsible for: • Planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Performance

  Professional standards applied and level of assurance We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) ‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information’ and, in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions, in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 “Assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements”. Greenhouse Gas quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. 

  Our independence and quality control We have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International
