  Inclusion of the Sustainable Development Goals – SDGs within the Group’s CSR approach 

  The UN Sustainable Development Goals have established the new course for businesses which, like CMA CGM, are acting responsibly and would like to take responsibility for their economic, social, societal and environmental impacts. 

  This list of 17 global goals includes the respect for human rights and fundamental free- doms, the fight against inequality and the pre - servation of the environment.

  In 2018, CMA CGM measured its CSR approach against the 17 SDGs. The aim was to determine the extent to which the Group’s CSR approach was in line the UN programme. The results of these efforts are outlined in the introduction to each part of this document.

  Group CSR materiality matrix 

  he materiality analysis 3 was updated in order to rank the Group’s 15 CSR challenges. These challenges have been ranked based on priority both by taking into account the strategy of the Group and its subsidiaries and by incorporating the vision of its stakeholders.

  The Group’s CSR risk mapping 

  With support from the Risk Management department, a CSR risk mapping was created in connection with the materiality matrix. The 2018 work involved: 

  - Firstly, identifying the existing mappings of the Group’s risks associated with each of the 15 CSR challenges and positioning each of these risks in a “CSR” risk mapping; 

  - Secondly, the challenges of the materiality matrix and the risks of the CSR risk mapping were measured against each other. This served to determine: 

  • The challenges without associated risks. Efforts are underway to conduct analyses of the missing risks; 

  • Whether the positioning of each risk was similar to or differed from the challenges. In this exercise, differences were identified and explained. 

  To date, the following CSR-related risks have been identified: 

  - Risk of non-compliance with “ethics and compliance” regulations especially regarding: competition, corruption, economic sanctions and personal data protection - Risks in partnerships with our suppliers and subcontractors - Breach of human rights - Improper working conditions - Poor health & safety management - Poor security management - Uncontrolled climatic change - Scarcity of materials and uncontrolled waste production - Uncontrolled pollution - Harm to biodiversity 18

  Risk management and mapping of the Group’s risks 

  Risk management is handled by the Corporate Risk Management and Internal Audit Department. The Risk Management team implements a Corporate level approach under the impetus of Top Management, with contribution from the various business lines. The methodology is based on a qualitative assessment carried out at a given time and projected over a year. The Group’s risk mapping and the micro risk mappings per business line / function are based on two criteria: - Probability of occurrence of the risk; - Severity of the impacts of the risk. Steering of CSR performance The CSR and Environment Department reports to General Management and is tasked with: • Implementing the CSR policy in line with 

  all of the Group’s policies; • Identifying stakeholder’s CSR issues, 

  priorities and expectations; • Setting CSR goals and coordinating the 

  CSR action plans; • Assessing, measuring and reporting on the CSR performance. 

  A CSR dashboard has been established to measure and steer the Group’s sustainable development performance, through a series of quantitative and qualitative indicators which are consolidated on a half-yearly basis. – cf. page 110 Table of Indicators. The exhaustiveness and reliability of the data, which increases from year to year, is guaranteed by indicator sheets describing in particular the collection and consolidation scope and processes. An extract of these indicator sheets is included in the “Methodological Note” section of this document. – cf. page 114 Methodological Note.

  CSR reporting is coordinated by the CSR Department. The data from the “CSR Dashboard” is checked by an Independent Third-Party Organisation every year. The report from this Independent Third-Party Organisation is appended hereto. – cf. page 107 Report by one of the Statutory Auditors Analysing the trends of these indicators serves to quantify the impact of the policies implemented, identify the thrusts for growth and determinine and/or adjust the goals and action plans for the year in progress and in the medium term. – cf. page 107 CSR Goals, 2018 achievements, 2019 action plans 

  A CSR Committee meets on a quarterly basis to analyse the “CSR Dashboard”, didentify the strategic thrusts driven by Top Management and determine the appropriate course of action. This Committee is made up of members from departments such as Human Resources, Risk Management and Internal Audit, Compliance, Finance, Communication and Marketing, and the network of agencies, Purchasing, Transformation and Innovation, Security, Safety and Environment, the Lines as well as CMA Ships, the CMA CGM Foundation and subsidiaries. It is also worth noting that specific “business line” or “project” Committee meetings are held in parallel and more operational working groups are set up at a greater frequency. At the same time, an expanding network of CSR officers has been established. 

  The Group’s CSR performance recognised by EcoVadis 

  CMA CGM communicates about its CSR approach both within and outside the company. Moreover, in our efforts to extend our CSR policy beyond the mere regulatory requirements, every year, the Group voluntarily submits its CSR performance for assessment by EcoVadis. With a GOLD rating in 2018, CMA CGM ranks amongst the top 1% of companies assessed by EcoVadis worldwide. 

  Furthermore, in 2018, the Silver Sustainability Award was bestowed upon CMA CGM by Nike to recognise its sustainable development commitment.

  Customer Centricity

  As an expert in logistics, a core business of the Group, CMA CGM must be exemplary at all stages of its value chain. As a matter of fact, with over 30,000 suppliers and 65,000 customers worldwide, CMA CGM innovates and imagines the goods shipping solutions of the future by developing: • Innovation & digital transformation to serve operational performance; • Customer satisfaction: improving the customer experience at all stages of the process; • Responsible procurement: establishing a lasting and efficient relationship with suppliers and subcontractors.

  1. Innovation & digital transformation to enhance performance

  23

  A dedicated organisation Digital transformation is a strategic goal for the Group. It includes both improving the Group’s performance and enhancing the service provided to customers. The Group relies on 3 elements as a means of concretely bringing about this transformation: 

  1. Several dedicated teams (Digital Office, Transformation, Factory, Data) to achieve the digital transformation of the Group. Their common aim is to initiate new projects, prove their concept and commercial value, develop the best of these projects and ease their implementation within the Group’s business lines at an international scale. 

  2. Our digital strategy is built on 5 strengths which will transform the shipping sector over the next 10 years and which will help to answer to the following 5 questions:

  • How can we remain relevant in an 

  constantly changing industry? • How can we continuously and efficiently 

  optimise the management of operations? • How can we optimise our rates and 

  volumes for our customers? • How can we foster customer loyalty 

  through a tailored customer experience? • How can we provide the Group’s employees with the tools to do their jobs better? 

  3. An investment fund called CMA CGM Ventures, which invested in a dozen start-up in France and abroad. The goal is to support the growth of these start-up internationally, while allowing them to draw from the CMA CGM ecosystem and the expertise of all employees. In most cases, these are start- up with which the Group has developed operational partnerships (Nyshex 4 , e-dray 5 , Traxens) so that they can continue over the long term.

**************************** Page 13****************************

  24

  In 2018, the transformation launched some 45 projects and partnerships, such as:

  SmartPort Challenge 

  As part of the SmartPort Challenge, the Group tasked start-up with imagining the port of the future and particularly with optimising container logistics: Optimisation of Gate Out by Trucks. The SmartPort Challenge was initiated by the Marseilles Provence Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Aix Marseilles University and the Grand Port Maritime de Marseilles with a view to further enhancing the existing port ecosystem in France. CMA CGM decided to champion this innovative approach by becoming a partner of this project alongside 6 other major international groups. In October 2018, Rajesh Krishnamurthy, Senior Vice-President of IT, presented the challenge to the start-up : 

  “This challenge stemmed from a simple and operational observation: shipping is very competitive and one major issue for the industry’s players is the optimisation of container flows, as several steps are required for the timely departure of the container from the terminal [...]. The aim of this challenge is to improve the supply chain so as to provide the best possible service to customers and reflect the CMA CGM Group’s overall digitalisation policy.” Start-up had until late 2018 to submit their projects. The selected candidates will be able to test and implement their solutions for a period of 3 months in early 2019 within The Camp and will be presented with a € 15,000 grant.

  BLUEBOX: first in-house innovation competition 

  BlueBox is a virtual suggestion box to promote innovation and creativity for digital transformation. “Digital technology plays a pivotal role in the company’s transformation through its agility, simplification and especially the collaborative applications”, explained Thierry Billion, Senior Vice- President and sponsor of the Digital Culture theme. 

  Three themes were selected to guide the employees’ ideas: 

  • Customer Focus; • Operational Experience; • Digital Culture. 

  This virtual suggestion box was a resounding success given that: • 379 ideas were deposited into the Bluebox; • 60% of the Head Office employees took part in the competition by offering ideas, voting for or commenting on their favourite 

  ideas. The 3 selected projects subsequently took part in the Design Thinking phase. For 3 days and based on collaborative workshops, the various groups refined their ideas, determined the user needs as well as the issues in order to achieve a design draft and a description of the various desired functionalities. 

  Key partnerships signed 

  At the Salon des Entrepreneurs business fair held in October 2017, Rodolphe Saadé announced his intention to create a CMA CGM start-up incubator in Marseilles (France)

  and to attract start-up from all around the world to this incubator. This ambitious incubation project was launched with a view to addressing several key issues: • Encouraging boldness and innovation; • Taking an active part in the economic buoyancy of the Provence Alpes Côte 

  d’Azur region; • Creating optimum conditions for innovation 

  within the shipping sector; • Accelerating the Group’s digital transformation; • Assisting in the emergence of a specialised innovation ecosystem in particular in the area of logistics. 

  This project will build on the various initiatives developed by CMA CGM in the region: • Support of “Carburateur”, a business incubator located in the Northern districts of Marseilles and created with support 

  from public authorities; • Partnership with Aix Marseilles French Tech; • Partnership with The Camp, an innovative campus bringing together major corpo- rations, start-up, professors and researchers – cf page 62 – Fostering creative cooperation with The Camp; • Partnerships with global IT leaders such as IBM and Infosys. 

  ZEBOX 

  ZEBOX is an international start-up incubator and accelerator that was created in Marseilles in 2018 by Rodolphe Saadé, Chief Executive Officer of the CMA CGM Group. It works in areas such as transport, logistics, mobility and X.0 industry. 

  As part of its incubation programme, ZEBOX hosts 15 start-up for a period of 12 to 18 months. An acceleration programme will be launched in early 2019 and will make it possible to host 8 start-up for a period of 8 months.

  The driving objective is to become a world benchmark for innovation: artificial intelligence, blockchain, virtual reality / augmented reality, ecosystem of connected objects, cybersecurity, robotics, etc. 

  ZEBOX has three goals: 

  • Guiding the success of the start-up with projects developed based on cutting- edge core technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, the ecosystem of connected objects and robotics by immediately steering them towards 

  international perspective; • Fostering open innovation by establishing arrangements between major corporations and the start-up so that they can innovate 

  together; • Creating a genuine network of business and cooperation opportunities by establishing solid partnerships with the various ecosystems and prominent figures in innovation worldwide. 

  The support provided is customised to match the needs of each independent business as it is prepared with a dedicated, expert and human- centric ZEBOX team. Sector experts and the ZEBOX mentor network thereby provide the start-up with assistance on a daily basis. 

  The start-up hosted by ZEBOX can draw on a solid network of partners; French and international corporations from various complementary sectors including CMA CGM, the founding Corporate partner of ZEBOX, and Accenture, BNP Paribas, Centrimex and EY. This network of partners provide the start-up with valuable business expertise and grant them access to exceptional resources including experts, technologies, the possi- bility of completing proofs of concept, busi- ness opportunities, international network, capital-risk, business angels, etc., thereby fostering their development.

Based on these results, CMA CGM carried out a more thorough analysis of customer expectations via 1,700 interviews conducted in 2018. Service indicators have been established improving the customer experience at each step of the journey

  strategic priority of the Group. Within this context, a programme to improve the customer experience was launched to allow CMA CGM to: 

  • Meet new customer expectations; • Stand out from competitors with an innovative range of services; • Capitalise on its closeness to customers. 

  Rodolphe Saadé, Chief Executive Officer of the CMA CGM Group, has set all his teams the goal of becoming the No. 1 shipping line of its customers. 

  The CMA CGM Group chose the TPM 6 conference to present its new “Customer Centricity” strategy and also introduced the Customer Experience programme driven by a powerful ambition: “Caring beyond Shipping”, working closely with our customers. 

  Therefore, CMA CGM prepared an ambitious transformation plan which will improve all of its interactions with its customers. This involves changes to the internal structure, an acceleration of the training programmes and new digital tools. 

  Customer satisfaction is a core concern of CMA CGM and as such the company has committed to improving its service quality, through the performance of annual customer surveys and the establishment of the Customer Charter defined in 2015.

  therefore fall within a process of continued improvement. This approach was supported by a Customer Journey Mapping carried out with 11 customers. 

  New initiatives have been launched: 

  • CMA CGM invested in a new multi-channel customer contact centre. It is fundamental to ensure consistency between the various channels and this will benefit employees by lightening their work load and improving the quality of service provided. In 2019, this tool will be integrated into the e-commerce platform and will include a self-service function. The first pilots were conducted in 2018 in 4 countries. This phase preceded a plan for global roll-out in the shared services agencies and centres to ensure end-to-end service quality. 

  • To enhance the Group’s digital transfor- mation, which will provide interested customers with a fully digital service in 2019, CMA CGM also added twenty new features to its e-commerce solution throughout 2018. These include online payment (gradually implemented in each country), new simplified customer dashboards with a self-service reporting module, new operational notifications regarding the transported goods, a shipment geo-tracking tool, a dynamic online support, the provision of all inland rates, etc. Other features will be rolled out in 2019, such as the Geo schedule, instant booking confirmation, electronic B/L, etc.

  In addition, as a means of providing further support to customers in the development of their business, CMA CGM has created new value-adding innovative services. Through this strategy, the company can specifically address customer needs, thereby making CMA CGM a key partner in their logistics chain. 

  In 2018, 6 new value-adding products were launched: • Traxens : the smart container. As a matter of fact, the containers are series- equipped with top-of-the-line connected technologies, serving to transmit data, almost in real time, regarding the position (geographic location, etc.) and condition of the goods (temperature, impact detection, etc.). Therefore, the customer benefits from

  better traceability and cost optimisation

  goods transport; • Reeflex : a new technological system for the transportation of liquids via a bag installed 

  in a container; • Climactive : controlled atmosphere tech - nology, which maintains products’ fresh- ness up to destination by more rapidly re- 

  ducing the oxygen level within a container; • Bar locks : to secure the goods and prevent 

  thefts; • Reefer pharma : offering tailored expertise and enhanced control for the pharma- ceutical industry.

  3. Sustainable procurement: establishing a lasting relationship with suppliers and subcontractors CMA CGM places fundamental importance in establishing a stable and long-lasting relationship with its suppliers. To this end, the Group, purchasing advisors, suppliers and subcontractors work in close cooperation for this purpose. 

  The adoption of the Sapin II Law and the law on the duty of care of parent companies and contracting authorities has led the Group to strengthen its oversight mechanism in relation to the fight against corruption,

  before any agreement is made. This charter is systematically included in the contracts. To strengthen its approach and promote responsible behaviour amongst suppliers, the CSR contractual clauses are added in the contracts and General Purchasing Conditions. 

  Mapping of procurement risks as a corner- stone In 2018, a mapping of “procurement risks” was implemented at Group level, with the risk

  Specific training courses are organised per region to provide sales teams with the necessary expertise regarding these products. 

  Moreover, other actions implemented for customers were recognised during 2018. Below are a few examples:

  APL honoured with the “Ship Owner / Operator” Award at the Seatrade Maritime Awards Asia 2018 

  In April 2018, APL won the “Ship Owner / Operator” Award at the Seatrade Maritime Awards Asia 2018. The award acknowledges APL’s excellent performance in terms of innovation, customer service, operations, commercial development and environmental protection. APL’s Chief Executive Officer stated: “This momentus win as APL celebrates 170 years of global shipping. This award reflects the confidence that shippers have in the APL brand. At the heart of our customer-first culture is APL’s innovative spirit, which will live on for many more years to come.”

In addition to all the operational representatives from the purchasing department, this Committee aggregates the key stakeholders working in the relevant areas of expertise (Legal, Compliance, Audit and Risk, Human Resources and CSR departments). Within this context, the Group has put in place the action plans regarding the regulatory changes involving suppliers. 

  The Third-Party Code of Conduct to strengthen its responsible approach cf. page 36 The Group’s compliance policies. In 2014, the CMA CGM Group created a Partner Charter which outlines all of the Group’s CSR commitments and obligations as well as the expectations for its suppliers and subcontractors. Therefore, the suppliers consulted during calls for tenders and those awarded contracts via other methods must sign this Partner Charter

  risk level. 

  The establishment of a supplier and subcontractor assessment system to enhance the steering of procurement risks An overall supplier and intermediary assessment system has been established and covers the aforementioned main risks. Since January 2018, the Group’s Central Purchasing Department has worked, with support from an outside consulting firm, on developing a specific procedure aimed at strengthening the steering of supplier risks. This procedure relies on a classification of the purchasing categories based on three risk levels (High, Medium, Low). 29

  30

  The criteria used to assess the risk level are as follows: - Location: the countries in which the supplier operates - The level of sensitivity of the supplier’s business activity with regard to the compliance risk 

  The enhanced comprehensive supplier and intermediary assessment system will be implemented in 2019 under the supervision of the Group’s Central Purchasing Department, initially with a pilot period of 3 months before being gradually rolled out to the entire Group. The aim is to harmonise the various practices and to have a common procedure applied at Group level. The assessment system consists of 5 steps: support division, a 3 rd level of analysis will be conducted, with the involvement of the CMA CGM support functions (finance department, legal/compliance department, CSR department). In 2019, the purchasers will receive training and guidance in order to quickly identifty the areas for improvement and thereby develop progress plans with the suppliers. ➊ The “pre-qualification“ , this step is aimed at identifying the suppliers and intermediaries at greatest risk. It is achieved with a tool that relies on country- specific indices regarding corruption, ethics, environment and type of activity. ➋ The “risk-assessment” step, includes ➍ The fourth step is the “Qualification” step and depends on the overall grade received by the supplier and the level of priority: - For the suppliers who obtain an above average grade per area (approx. 60%), a standard qualification is issued and is valid for 4 years; - For suppliers between 25% and the previous threshold, a 2-year qualification is issued; - For suppliers below 25%, a 1-year quali- fication is issued. the systematic sending of an assessment questionnaire to all suppliers and intermediaries. This questionnaire contains several sections with the following themes: general information, financial elements, fight against corruption, economic sanctions, human rights, health & safety, the environment, etc. This assessment questionnaire was developed with the assistance of all the relevant support functions of the company (Legal, CSR, Finance, Purchasing, etc.), and is enhanced ➎ The last step, the “Monitoring” step, is used to carry out watch and take advantage of a dynamic system. As a matter of fact, by feedback. The whole of this information is recorded in a single qualification report per supplier.

It is carried out at a 1 st level by the purchasers of the various relevant areas. In the event of a more thorough 2 nd -level analysis, the purchaser will call on the support division of the Centrale Purchasing Department.

  To measure the efficiency of the implemented actions, 5 monitoring indicators have been iden- tified and cover the main procurement risks. • % of suppliers which signed the Partner Charter; • Number of assessed suppliers; • Average score of the companies assessed 

  by EcoVadis; • Average score of the companies assessed 

  by CMA CGM with Cscreen; • Ratio of suppliers at risk. The pilot period will help to obtain a refe- rence point and define the required adjust - ments. These monitoring indicators will be disclosed in the next report on non-financial information. 31

  The Code of Ethics is applied worldwide to all legal enti- ties, subsidiaries, affiliates, partnerships, joint ventures and other business associations directly or indirectly controlled by CMA CGM. The CMA CGM Partner Charter contains the main principles of the Code of Ethics, and is intended for third parties. 

  The Code of Ethics applies to all individuals worldwide wor- king for CMA CGM, regardless of their management level, particularly the executive officers, managers and employees. 

  The Code of Ethics is available in French, English, Arabic, Spanish and Mandarin. In 2018, the Code of Ethics was updated to take into account the changes which occurred regarding the fight against corruption, compliance with economic sanctions, competition law and personal data protection.

  1. Business Ethics and Anti-Corruption

  35

  Chief Executive Officer of the CMA CGM Group

  CMA CGM has continued its efforts to strengthen its anti-corruption compliance programme by adhering to the requirements of the Sapin II Law (A) as well as revising or creating specific Compliance procedures for the Group (B) while taking part in joint actions with other shipping players (C). 

  A. Compliance with requirements of the Sapin II Law In 2018, the Group continued to develop managing the corruption risks to which the Group is exposed. It also serves to report to Top management and the persons in charge of Compliance, the information needed to establish measures to prevent an anti-corruption programme including the eight pillars of the French anti- corruption law, known as the Sapin II Law. This anti-corruption programme includes: 

  and detect the risks of corruption that are appropriate for the identified challenges; • The introduction of an Anti-Corruption • The strengthening and updating of the procedures (due diligence) to assess the compliance situation of CMA CGM’s partners, intermediaries, suppliers and customers; Code of Conduct, forming an integral part of the Binding Corporate Rules of companies established in France and concurrent updating of the Code of Ethics. The Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct contains rules applicable to the fight • The introduction of internal and external accounting check procedures to ensure that the ledgers, registers and financial statements are not used to conceal acts of corruption or influence peddling; against corruption and influence peddling and the disciplinary sanctions in the event

  B. The Group’s compliance policies 

  In 2018, the CMA CGM Group revised and created various Ethics and Anti-Corruption policies. These policies form part of the Group’s compliance programme and contribute to the application of the Sapin II Law. 

  The Code of Ethics, as mentioned in the introduction, applies to the entire CMA CGM Group. 

  The Third-Party Code of Conduct is intended for all “Business Partners”, i.e. all individuals or organisations which/who

  The Gifts and Hospitality Policy describes the acceptable and prohibited behaviours. 

  In 2018, the Group also revised its Conflict of Interest Policy. This policy involves an annual conflict of interest disclosure statement which is mandatory for all persons considered as “key people” and a list of whom is included in the appendix. The 2018 Conflict of Interest Policy has expanded the list of key people subject to this mandatory annual disclosure statement. All other CMA CGM Group employees must make a disclosure statement whenever they are faced with a potential risk of conflict of interest. Furthermore, in 2018, with the introduction of the Ethics Hotline, the conflict of interest disclosure statements must be made via this new system. However, an alternative procedure is planned for employees who do not have access to the Internet. These changes are included in the new Conflict of Interest Policy initiated in 2018. 

  In 2018, the CMA CGM Group worked on the development of an Interest

  C. The Group’s actions to guarantee compliance within the shipping industry 

  Since March 2014, the Group has been a member of the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network, which is fighting to eliminate corruption in the shipping and port sectors. The Maritime Anti-Corruption Network is a global business network working towards the development of a maritime industry free of corruption that enables fair trade to the benefit of society at large. 

  The MACN In 2018, the network had over 100 members from the maritime industry. The secretariat of the MACN is based in Copenhagen and is carried out by BSR, a Non-Governmental Organisation. Its responsibility is to advance the initiatives and actions of MACN and it produces various tools or communications that are made available to the members. 

  The work of the MACN is structured around three core areas:

  Representatives Policy. This policy will take effect in January 2019. The Interest Representatives Policy lays down the applicable code of conduct and ethical rules and specifies a “due diligence” procedure before CMA CGM hires any interest

  CMA CGM Partner Charter or equivalent rules of behaviour. – cf. page 29 The Third- Party Code of Conduct to strengthen its responsible approach 

  In 2018, pursuant to the Sapin II Law, and following consultation with the Staff Representative Bodies (CE, CHSCT, CCE) and DIRECCTE, CMA CGM launched the Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct. The Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct is included in the Binding Corporate Rules of all CMA CGM companies located in France. 

  In 2018, the Group revised its Gifts and Hospitality Policy. Whenever they are not reasonable, gifts, meals, travel, accommodation, marketing or recreational events can be considered as bribes. As a result, all CMA CGM Group employees must display honesty and transparency in these areas, so that their behaviour is not construed in any respect as the acceptance or the offering of a bribe.

  representative. 

  The CMA CGM Group has also developed a compliance “due diligence” procedure applicable to third parties with whom CMA CGM intends to develop a business relationship. Given the sectors in which it operates, CMA CGM has business relationships with many third parties (customers, suppliers, subcontractors, intermediaries, brokers, co-investors, etc.). By exercising vigilance regarding the integrity of the third parties with which it does business, CMA CGM is acting to enforce its anti-corruption policy.

  COLLECTIVE ACTION 

  Working with governments, non-governmental organisations and civil society to identify and mitigate the root causes of corruption and improving the operational environment.

  STRENGTHENING CAPACITIES 

  Assisting member companies in implementing the MACN anti-corruption principles, developing tools and sharing best practices within the network.

  INTEGRITY CULTURE 

  Raising awareness of the challenges faced and heightening the standards of integrity within the maritime community.

  2. Economic sanctions

  4. Personal data protection

  • Close link with the geopolitical context • Need to comply with European and American regulations

  For the past several years, CMA CGM has embarked upon a personal data protection policy within its information systems.

  As a leading French player in maritime shipping, CMA CGM must carry out its business by complying with regulations regarding economic sanctions. Leveraging on a dedicated team within the Legal Department and by raising the awareness of each employee to these problems, CMA CGM has embarked upon a security and compliance approach. 

  The ever-changing requirements in this area call for constant monitoring of regulatory developments, close cooperation with the relevant national and international authorities as well as empowerment of all staff through access to an interactive platform allowing them to understand the guidelines and good practices in the business activities involving the countries and exports at risk. 

  Moreover, CMA CGM has enhanced its approach for compliance with economic sanctions via a training programme with e-learning modules made available to each employee and newcomer, as well as classroom training sessions. 38

  3. Competition 

  The CMA CGM Group has made it its top priority to ensure that its employees know and comply with competition law. At the end of the maritime conferences in Europe in 2008, the Group developed a competition law compliance programme designed to guarantee that all the business activities of the Group’s entities and subsidiaries in France and worldwide comply with competition law. The programme applies to all Group employees, especially in connection with their relationship with customers, competitors, partners and suppliers. 

  This programme has led inter alia to the creation of a division of legal practitioners specialised in competition law within the Group’s Legal Department and to the delivery of many classroom and online training courses. 

  Following the delivery of an e-learning programme from 2008 to 2018 which helped to train tens of thousands of employees in France and abroad, the Competition Law Compliance division of the Group’s Legal Department developed a new general competition e-learning module based on a more interactive format and which includes the differences in the legal systems of the foreign companies acquired by the Group over time. 

  This online training module is supplemented by tailor- made classroom training sessions for certain categories of employees, subsidiaries and entities of the Group. 

  At the same time, a good practices guideline, memos and regular publications on competition law news are broadly disseminated within the Group. 

  In the event of doubt, employees are strongly encouraged to consult the Competition Compliance division of the Legal Department or its local officers worldwide to ensure that their actions are compliant. 

  Any breach by an employee to the competition rules may be reported via the professional whistleblowing platform “Ethics Hotline”. 

  Suppliers and service providers from whom the Group purchases goods and services are also required to comply with the Group’s policy relating to competition law. 

  Finally, the Group implements specific measures when it acquires companies or creates joint ventures with partners in order to adhere to the competition rules applicable to these economic transactions.

  CMA CGM implements the organisational and technical means to protect the personal data of data subjects (customers, suppliers, employees, third parties) and extends its compliance policy to subcontractors and subsidiaries to guarantee compliance with the European personal data protection standard worldwide. The enforcement of this policy is supported by: • An intra-Group data protection policy; • A network of Data Protection Officers – 

  DPO; • An Audit Plan; • A training plan for employees. The Data Protection Officer (DPO) appointed by the Group ensures that this personal data protection policy is properly enforced. 

  5. Compliance: a company culture achieved through raising awareness and training of all employees 

  The dissemination of the Compliance culture within the Group is achieved via various methods: 

  > "Tone at the top" : lManagers must set the example and ensure that the projects that they supervise are handled ethically and comply with the Code of Ethics and applicable laws. > Adaptation of the compliance approach based on the perceived risk: the sectors at risk of non-compliance should be highlighted by correlating the compliance efforts to the sectors where the risk of non-compliance is the highest based on our risk mapping.

  > The dissemination of the policies over the Intranet: the documents comprising the Group’s Compliance programme can be consulted by all employees on the Group’s Intranet, on a dedicated page. This page aggregates all the Group’s Policies and Procedures and tools for all employees such as interactive charts to identify the countries subject to economic sanctions. At the same time, the “Ethics and Compliance” space on the www.cma-cgm.fr website provides all individuals with the Code of Ethics, the Partner Charter and outlines our various Ethics and Compliance policies. 

  > Employee training. Training is also a key element in the Group’s Compliace policy: 

  • Guidance is offered for all the Group’s employees via classroom courses taught at the head office and in the regions. These courses are renewed on a regular basis and are intended for those employees who are most exposed to Compliance risks 

  irrespective of their geographical location; • e-learning modules on Compliance are compulsory for Group’s employees and are regularly updated. In 2018, two new e-learning modules were introduced, one entitled “Introduction to personal data protection” on European Competition Law and another entitled “Fighting 

  corruption”; • All new employees receive support in their compliance training. Firstly, they are required to sign the Code of Ethics online before starting their employment contract. They then receive a reminder email concerning all the e-learning modules on compliance that they are required to take. Finally, as of December 2019, a member of the Compliance Department will briefly explain to new employees the Department’s actions during the various orientation sessions.

  40 system: Ethics Hotline

  The reporting of potential or proven breaches to laws, regulations, policies or procedures of the Group are embodied in the Code of Ethics and encourages accountability amongst the Group’s employees in their commitment to ethical conduct. 

  CMA CGM provides employees and third parties with a website: http://cma-cgm.ethicspoint.com which allows them to: 

  • Ask questions to the Compliance 

  Department; • Make a report via an online form; • Make a report via a dedicated phone number (the phone numbers are listed per country and are available on the Group’s 

  website or on the intranet); • Ensure that whistleblowers remain anonymous, if they so desire and if the 

  local regulations so allow; • Access to a 24/7 platform. 

  As of 2019, the Ethics Hotline system will be used to gather statistics in terms of the reports made.

  The introduction of this new system will also go in hand with new policies, such as the Non-Retaliation Policy intended to remind employees of CMA CGM’s commitment to protecting whistle-blowers who make reports in good faith of a potential breach to the law or internal policies. 

  As such, all employees are encouraged to use any means to report, by any method, to Top Management, their line managers or the Group Compliance Department and/or by any other existing channel, any breach to the Code of Ethics, the compliance policies as well as the applicable procedures and regulations, irrespective of their area and particularly: 

  • Fraud and/or corruption; • Anti-competition practices; • Respect for human rights; • And generally any potential breach to the Group’s Code of Ethics or Policies.

  7. Duty of care – Vigilance Plan 

  In 2017, as soon as the law on the duty of care by parent companies and large corporations was voted, a cross-functional and multi- disciplinary work group involving the CSR, Risk Management and Purchasing divisions was created to meet the 5 requirements of the law. 

  Their first tasks, to best enforce the Law on the Duty of Care, were to: 

  • Identify all the actions undertaken by the Group regarding health, safety, the 

  environment and social aspects; • Identify the scope and breakdown the 

  Group’s business activities; • Within the company: office-based activities, 

  operational, maritime and terminal activities; • Outside the company: suppliers and subcontractors.

  Note: detailed progress of the actions carried out as part of the vigilance plan is presented in the following pages. They will be analysed during 2019. The effectiveness of these actions will be presented in the 2019 CSR Report. 41

  Consultation of the risk mappings existing in the va- rious Group departments, in particular the mapping of the Group’s major risks and the mapping of the HSE (Health Safety Environment) risks. 

  Assessment of the risks relating to fundamental freedoms, health and safety of people, and the environ- ment which are not covered by these mappings based on the methodology of the Group’s Risk Management department. 

  With regard to Suppliers and Subcontractors, a mapping of the risks was carried out in 2018. A pilot assessment with 120 suppliers was also initiated via the EcoVadis tool.

  In order to cover the entire Group and the diversity of its business lines, the scopes used in the CSR report (in accordance with the materiality matrix) were adopted. 

  The risk assessment scope covers shore-based activities in France and abroad, Maritime operational activities, the Terminals, Logistics and suppliers and subcontractors. 

  5 Human Rights risks, 5 Envi - ronment risks and 6 Procure - ment risks have been identified as part of this exercise. The main risks are as follows: 

  • Risks for the health and safety of people onboard owned vessels and at the terminals, Security risks 

  abroad. • Risks of pollution and damage to biodiversity: hydrocarbon pollution or pollution through the loss of containers, pollution by 

  vessels, pollution of the soil. • Risks associated with the

  2. Diversity 

  The strength of the CMA CGM Group lies in the diversity of the Men and Women working there. Diversity plays a fundamental role in guiding the Group’s strategy. As a source

  

  INTERCULTURALITY to improve understanding 

  of different foreign partners' culture and thus encourage exchanges

  

  INTERGENERATIONALITY to develop knowledge and the transfer of skills between the different generations

  GENDER EQUALITY to feminise the Group's image and reduce t he status gap between men and women

  46 

  As of 31/12/2018, the number of Group employees was 32,670 8 people. The total number including international seagoing staff 9 was 37,092 10 employees. 2017 2018 

  Group total workforce 

  Incl. international seagoing 34,647 37,092 personnel 

  The number of new hires amounted to 8,208 11 people and the number of departures amounted to 6,337 12 people. 

  Regarding seagoing staff: As of 31/12/2018, the number of seagoing staff amounted to: 2017 2018 

  French seagoing staff 494 479 

  International seagoing staff 4,019 4,424 

  Total seagoing employees 4,513 4,903 

  The upward trend in the number of seafarers can be explained by the slight increase in vessels as well as an adjustment of the calculation methods.

  of inspiration and innovation, it helps us to better understand customer expectations, and to offer them tailored transport solutions and high-quality services. The diversity within the Group is defined by gender equality, multi-culturalism, and intergenerationality in order to foster emulation to enable mutual enrichment. 

  The CMA CGM Group strives to give everyone the same opportunities so they can avance in the organisation. Our Code of Ethics clearly explains our aim to expand diversity and equal opportunity. We derive our integrity by respecting and protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms as instituted in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Through this declaration, we have committed to eliminating any discrimination of any kind, based on nationality, class, race, disability, gender, age, religion and political views. More broadly, the Group’s anti-discrimination policy is based on the principles of freedom of opinion, job placement and retention for disabled employees and job equality as per the collective bargaining agreement. As such, many projects have been put in place and continuous talks are underway between the personnel representative bodies and management to address more in-depth areas of action for the labour climate and the work environment in general. 

  In May 2017, the CMA CGM Group created the “Diversity for a better performance” committee. The goal of this Committee is to make diversity a source of performance for the Group and is structured around 3 areas of focus:

  A. Multiculturalism 

  The Group’s workforce consists of people from 149 nationalities, spread across 140 countries. As multiculturalism is a source of richness for the Group, initiatives have been developed, particularly via training tools, in order to facilitate dialogue and optimise communication, not only within the Group but also with its customers and all its stakeholders. 

  Breakdown of workforce by region: 

  Region 13 2018 

  France 11% 

  Europe (except France) 14% 

  Africa – Middle-East 19% 

  Americas 13% 

  Asia - Oceania 43% 

  In 2018, the workforce increased in Asia, Oceania and the Americas, as a result of strengthening of the staffing levels within the shared services centres.

  B. Intergenerationality 

  Within the Group, the average age of employees is 37 years of age and the average number of years of service is 7. In 2018, the Group celebrated its 40 th anniversary, it is partly due to the diverse profiles and ages of its employees that the Group has acquired such a solid foundation. 

  Age 14 2018 

  <20 0,2% 

  20 – 29 29,6% 

  30 – 39 32% 

  40 – 49 19,8% 

  50 – 59 11,2% 

  >60 2,3% 

  No age reported 4,9% 

  As over 60% of the Group’s employees are between 20 and 40 years old, “expert” conferences and mentoring initiatives have been developed to support young talents and foster the transfer of expertise.

  Launch of a world simplification approach 

  In late July 2018, the Group launched an approach to simplify procedures with a view to improving its efficiency. This approach is intended for all employees, whether on land or at sea, irrespective of their department or subsidiary. The goal is to identify a problemlatic area which may be simplified or improved within the day-to-day working practices and thereby help to streamline the Group’s organisation. 

  A specific address has been created to allow employees to share their simplification ideas. This programme has received strong support from employees since its introduction, with over 280 ideas received in just a few months. 

  These ideas are studied during simplification committee meeting, attended by the CEO of the Group and the entire executive team. At the end of the committee meeting, some initiatives are approved to be implemented whereas others which do not require strategic decisions are directly validated by the relevant departments. The Group provides regular updates on the initiatives which have been implemented, and those underway or which have been validated and encourages staff to continue contributing to the simplification approach. 48

  We are Shipping 

  The CMA CGM Group has set up the We Are Shipping program, which aims to support women in their professional development and to promote harmonious internal diversity management functions. In 2018, 12 women joined this leadership transformation program. Through a whole series of actions and events (group coaching, testimonials of women with an inspiring course, personal branding workshop, training, co-development, personalized HR...), they were able to work on their development plan and create a network in France and internationally with women occupying responsible positions. The program is already starting to produce encouraging results with mobilities and promotions, in France and internationally and a general awareness of the interest for all to develop internally diversity. In 2019, a second group of 14 women will benefit of the same program. The We Are Shipping program will also be deployed in several other countries.

  C. Gender equality 

  With women representing 45% of the Group’s workforce, and 13% of employees in a management position, the CMA CGM Group has committed to fostering gender equality at the workplace for many years. This commitment is demonstrated by a strong recruitment, promotion and training policy as well as the organisation of events such as themed lunches, as a time to share, talk and to inform, collect suggestions from female employees and recommend new actions (Day of the Woman, Pink October, conferences, range of communication campaigns, etc.). It is also worth noting that pursuant to the Copé-Zimmermann law laying down rules for gender balance in boards of directors (over 40% of female directors), the CMA CGM Board of Directors is comprised of over 45% of female directors. 

  Gender 15 2018 

  Female 45% 

  Male 55% 

  D. Disability 

  The CMA CGM Group helps to support people with special needs during their professional career. At the head office in Marseilles, the Occupational Health department is responsible for identifying people with disabilities. Once the Group has been informed, it steps in by offering individual measures to adjust, adapt or transform the work station thereby enabling the relevant employee to retain his or her job. Some of the top initiatives implemented include work station adjustment (foot rests, headsets, ergonomic chairs, specific computer hardware, etc.) and the provision of a designated parking space. Throughout the year, CMA CGM calls on companies from the sheltered employment sector to provide brochures or office supplies to the head office. Furthermore, in 2017, the Group decided to grant two days of additional leave to employees with a dependent disabled child. As of 31/12/2018, 22 employees have taken advantage of this agreement.

  In 2018, on the United Nations’ International Day of Persons with Disabilities, the CMA CGM Foundation and the Human Resources Department invited employees of the Tower to take part in a round-table discussion about disabilities. This informal event gave employees the opportunity to discuss this issue, share their experiences and report any difficulties. As a further step, the Group Human Resources Department initiated a working group in December 2018 on the consideration of disabilities within the company. The goal is to ultimately increase awareness with regard to diversity as a source of richness, inspiration and creativity for the company. 

  3. Work organisation A. Quality of life at the workplace 

  Several steps have been taken to ensure a good work-life balance for employees. For example, a gender equality agreement 16 specifies in particular the 100% coverage of paternity leave for shore-based and seagoing personnel, working time arrangements for pregnant women, provision of 12 cribs within a private daycare centre to accommodate 18 children of employees or the payment of an “early childhood allowance” through the works councils, and the establishment of individualised hours for full-time employees (variable time slots) for all onshore institutions in Metropolitan France. 

  Barring any emergencies, travel must be planned in advance. The seagoing staff also needs fair warning of ship departures so that they can make family arrangements as expressed by the employees. The working conditions are discussed at meetings of the Health and Safety Committees attended by Union and Management Representatives. 

  Efforts to improve the quality of life at the workplace mainly relate to ensuring better follow-up of employees. For instance, a support process has been introduced to assist employees returning from long-term absences which includes inter alia various meetings organised between the human resources team, the manager and, as applicable, the occupational psychologist.

**************************** Page 26****************************

  Company Mobility Plan In May 2018, a specific mobility team was put together in Marseilles primarily to improve day-to-day mobility and simplify the use of public transportation. Following a survey of employees, several avenues have been explored and practical solutions have been proposed. These include: 

  • the “C-Park” in-house application: this application was developed by the CMA 

  CGM digital teams as a means of optimising the unused parking spaces at the CMA CGM Tower (leaves, absences, business trips, etc.). Following a trial period in the Summer of 2018, the application was officially launched in November 2018. This solution serves to reallocate an average of 80 parking spaces per day, to employees who are in need of a parking space; up to 150 spaces may be distributed per day during holiday periods. 

  • A dedicated car sharing platform: “Klaxit”. The employees who are interested in the solution and offering their services sign up 

  and input their journey into the application. The first 20,000 kilometers are offered by CMA CGM to employees. This solution was introduced in 2018 and enabled 82% of the registered employees to receive car sharing offers. 

  Furthermore, during the Mobility week, various communication initiatives were organised to pass on the solutions proposed and to promote the day-to-day mobility of employees (open house days, information sessions, poster campaign in the elevators, creation of a community group, article in the company’s internal newsletter, etc.). In addition, employees in Marseilles have

  been provided with various information sharing forums and communication tools to discuss their mobility on a daily basis (dedicated email address, community network, information on the Group’s intranet, etc.). The company has also signed a partnership 

  agreement with “La Cité des Entrepreneurs” (an association bringing together the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Euroméditerranée) to take part in, meet, share and keep abreast with new transport alternatives. The HR team assigned to the Company Mobility Plan will continue to work in 2019 and will rely in particular on the various partnerships established with institutions such as: Métropole, Région Sud (Auditorium, working groups on Mobility, etc.). 

  Skills-based sponsorship program 

  In 2018, the CMA CGM Group and the company foundation introduced the Skills sponsorship programme. This programme is an effort to harness employees’ professional and/or personal skills, to the benefit of a solidarity project. 10 volunteers in Marseilles (under an indefinite-term contract for over 6 months and with the consent of their manager) spent two half-days of their working time in one of the four partner associations of the scheme to help them with specific tasks. This is a genuine commitment by the Group’s employees to their civic responsibility to support associations which help children in difficulty on a daily basis. – cf page 103 – Set-up of the Skills-based sponsorship program.

  Company concierge service 

  The CMA CGM Group has set up a company concierge service at the Head Office to attend to the well-being of its employees, help them save time and generally make their life easier on a daily basis. The “Conciergerie by CMA CGM” offers a wide range of services to employees such as: 

  • Daily services: dry cleaning, ironing, shoe repair shop, sewing workshop, administrative procedures, etc. • Home service: child minding, homework assistance, house cleaning, DIY projects, gardening, etc. • Delivery services: medication, flowers, take-away, etc. • Other services: shirts and ties, coffee capsules, stockings, etc. 

  Every day, employees can consult with the concierge during the opening hours. They are also able, via a private connection, to contact a 24/7 call centre which allows them to book the services that they require. The services can be paid for online through a secure payment or via an e-wallet. In 2018, 6,754 employees used the services offered by Conciergerie by CMA CGM, with an average of 550 visits per month. 

  Partnership with Hôpital Européen 

  The CMA CGM Group has developed a partnership with Hôpital Européen since 2015. This hospital is located close to the CMA CGM Tower, thereby enabling employees to receive high-quality medical care closeby. They have a dedicated email address to make appointments for consultations and medical exams. 

  The quality of life at the workplace of seagoing staff 

  This approach is both proactive and compre- hensive: 

  • It is proactive as it seeks to improve the Quality of Life at the workplace as a whole and not simply to comply with the legal requirements of preventing Psycho-social Risks;

  • It is comprehensive as it acts on the social- organisational levers in connection with the work activity and assists employees with their specific health needs. 

  The joint Quality of Life at the Workplace group has continued its work. Its role is to analyse the results of the social follow-up and Quality of Life at the Workplace surveys, while issuing recommendations. 

  Within this context, it carries on the initiatives implemented in previous years: ergonomy of the vessels, Land-Sea relationship, Quality of Life at the Workplace onboard vessels. New actions have been conducted to promote and raise the awareness of the crews to the Quality of Life at the Workplace, good managerial practices, and the prevention of addictions. Furthermore, this year, new measures were introduced, including the simplification of the administrative processes on board, the analysis of accidents with fault tree analyses alongside the persons involved in the accidents. 

  The CCP group has set up specific training for the Quality of Life at the Workplace officers onboard the vessels. This training has been tailored then transferred to the Maritime Prevention Institute for qualification purposes and extended to all shipping companies. 

  The Quality of Life at the Workplace officers onboard the vessels will be provided with awareness raising tools to conduct their prevention actions. The CCP group will act as a “back-up” support for these individuals. 

  A partnership with ESP Consulting, an expert sports and performance centre has been implemented, in order to optimise the health and physical performance of seagoing personnel and reduce accident rate. ESP Consulting set up a pilot group onboard a vessel for three months to carry out its tasks, be identified by staff at sea and gather from the seagoing personnel the options for future improvement. The result obtained revealed an improvement of 40% of the physical condition for all the assessed criteria. 

  Another area for improvement for seagoing personnel is the food onboard vessels. A test phase was conducted with direct supply of the vessels without using the services of a shipchandler. The outcome was a positive one both in terms of the quality of the food and the pricing. This experiment will be gradually extended to the other vessels.

  B. Psycho-social risk prevention

  C. Work organisation

  Work organisation for seagoing staff

  52

  The Group’s policy on psycho-social risks is covered by an agreement signed on 20 May 2010 (agreement on preventing psycho-social risks among CMA CGM UES employees). The document provides milestones for a preventive programme to measure, analyse and monitor psycho-social risks. The recommended actions include: 

  • Preventing risks of workplace or sexual harrassment and instituting a reporting 

  procedure; • Organising training courses for managers in psycho-social risk prevention. 

  Since the agreement was signed, psychological support unit has been set up. The unit is available by telephone or online 24/7 and is a completely confidential space for employees to talk to someone of their choice. In addition to preventing psycho-social risks, it embodies the Group’s sustained promise to improve life in the workplace for its employees. Several long-term projects have been launched at both the individual and collective levels. The priority areas to work on are work environment, social climate and employee guidance. As part of the 2018 action plan, the Group commissioned an external training organisation to continue providing training to managers regarding good managerial practices. 

  An action plan on the Quality of Life at the Workplace has also been introduced and is structured around optimising working processes and procedures and specific workshops dedicated to good practices for reducing psycho-social risks. 

  The plan will be continued in 2019 with the occupational psychologist via the provision of training to managers regarding Quality of Life at the Workplace: Identification of risk factors, support to employees experiencing difficulties, emotional and relational intelligence. 

  I n connection with an individual approach, a review will also be conducted on 4 areas relating to employee wellbeing: emotional balance (dedicated conferences and workshops), improvement of organic nutritional intake at the company restaurant (dedicated dietician), physical activity (improvement of the facilities offered at th e fitness centre), and sleep.

  Work schedules are routinely organised in line with the prevailing local legislation. Working time arrangements have been instituted in some areas to enhance the work- home life balance and best meet the needs of customers. 

  Since 2007, the CMA CGM France UES (economic and social unit) for shore-based staff in France has an Agreement on Scheduling and Reducing Working Time. In addition to the legally mandated 35 hours of effective working time, it ensures flexibility for employees who are paid a flat rate. On a general basis for any organisation, managers must ensure workloads are properly divided and optimum organisation for their teams. 

  In 2016, a system was put in place to track, count and check employee attendance on the Marseilles site (Attendance Check Agreement). The working time remains unchanged, however it may vary by relatively 3 hours per week, provided that the average time per month is observed. The arrival and departure time ranges of the employees have been extended for greater flexibility in the management of their schedules. 

  In 2018, the pilot programme for telecommuting in the company was introduced. Telecommuting is an innovative form of working organisation which enables inter alia a better home-life balance, improved working conditions for employees and greater independence in the accomplishment of their tasks. 

  To this end, a pilot programme for telecommuting was experimented for four months for a limited number of services and employees at the Marseilles and Le Havre sites. 

  77 volunteers who met the eligibility criteria telecommuted for one day per week as mutually agreed between the employee and his or her manager. To support them in this process, a guideline has been compiled to answer all their questions. 

  As the deadline date for the end of the experiment approached, it was found that the initial period of 4 months was insufficient to make an accurate and definitive assessment. Therefore, in October 2018, the trial period was extended by 4 months as officialised by the signature of an amendment to the agreement covering the telecommuting scheme within the Marseilles and Le Havre facilities.

  The work organisation for seagoing staff complies with the international standards set by the Maritime Labour Convention 2006 which entered into force on 28 February 2013. Consequently, on the vessels: 

  • The number of working hours cannot exceed 14 hours per period of 24 

  hours and 72 hours per period of 7 days; • The minimum rest time cannot be less than 10 hours per period of 24 hours and 77 hours per period of 7 days; 

  The fleet management department adopted the rest time system, and the monthly working hours are monitored on board and on land to ensure our compliance. In order to see to it that seagoing staff get enough rest and avoid fatigue, the Group initially set a monitoring threshold of 120 hours for ratings and 150 hours for the hospitality department. In general, the Captain and the Chief Mechanic on board oversee that the standards established in the convention are followed. Maritime Labour Convention The International Labour Organisation (ILO) met in 2006 to create a unique document aggregating all the obligations concerning the working conditions and life onboard vessels. The Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) was created, adopted and published, and this convention became mandatory as of 2013 . 

  International maritime law now has 4 pillars: • SOLAS: Safety - Convention for the safety of life at sea; • MARPOL: Environment - Convention for the prevention of maritime pollution; • STCW: Training and certificate - International convention on standards of training, certification and watch-keeping for seafarers; • MLC: Social protection and working conditions – Maritime Labour Convention, i.e. the minimum living and working conditions for all seafarers In August 2017, 84 members of the ILO ratified this convention, representing 89% of global shipping. 

  MLC is organised into 5 parts: • Minimum requirements for seafarers to work on a ship; • Employment conditions; • Accommodation, recreational facilities, food and catering; • Health protection, medical care, welfare and social security protection; • Compliance and enforcement. 

  Due to the high quality of its vessels, CMA CGM was able to implement the MLC well before the deadline date of 2013. During the certification phase, no major shortcoming was found and whenever the vessels are inspected, the Group demonstrates excellent working and living conditions onboard its ships.

  D. Social dialogue 

  Social dialogue is a vital part of company life. It mainly occurs by providing employees with information. Strategy, economic, finance, social and organisational questions are addressed in a range of meetings attended by staff and management representatives. In addition to the staff representatives appointed at each entity 17 , these include the Group Committee, Central Works Council in France, Entity Commitees, the CHSCT (Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee) and a variety of specialised joint commissions. Pursuant to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and by virtue of the principles instituted in its Code of Ethics, the Group undertakes to respect the freedom of labour unions and the rules of association in the countries where it operates. 

  In France, several agreements 18 were signed in 2018: 

  • 2018-2020 profit sharing agreement; • 2018 NAO agreement; • Agreement on the telecommuting expe- riment within the Marseilles and Le Havre 

  facilities; • Amendment No. 1 to the telecommuting experiment within the Marseilles and Le 

  Havre facilities • Modification of the binding corporate rules of the Marseilles and Le Havre entities and other sites in France to comply with the Group’s Code of Ethics, the Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct and the whistleblowing policy. 

  4. An attractive employer A. Career management 

  In 2017, the Group continued development of career management, inter alia by transforming its HR tools. A new talent management approach was proposed for better support through the roll-out of the C&Me “Talent Management” module as an employer, in more than 40 countries for over 15,000 employees. It involves succession plans, identification of talents, assessments, optimisation and forecasting

  of organisations depending on activities. Within this context, the Group has implemented a “High Potential” identification process. This international review of “High Potential” is used to determine the key positions and anticipate succession plans. Furthermore, the Group encourages the initiatives of all employees seeking to embark upon new challenges. To this end, the Performance Interview, which has been officialised since 2015 in the new human resources management tool C&Me, allows shore-based employees and their line managers to take stock of their goals, measure their performance, formulate new career development wishes and express their training needs. 

  Mobility makes it possible to put skills where they are needed within the Group. The Group’s mobility policy offers a variety of innovative career paths in addition to regular types of mobility (expatriation, local contracts, secondment). As a result, employees are better able to expand their range of skills, hone their expertise or rise up through the ranks in managerial positions. 

  JUMP (Junior Upwards Mobility Program), as an innovative scheme, gives our young talents a chance to work abroad for 6 months to discover new jobs and a different working environment. Every year, some twenty employees take part in this international mobility programme. 

  “SWAP” is another option whereby two employees from different entities trade jobs. 

  The VIE programme (Volontariat International en Entreprise – French intern- ship programme) sends young graduates abroad to our local organisations to expand their knowledge, acquire new interpersonal skills and help standardise practices and procedures within the Group. At the end of their contracts, we offer them career opportunities and a chance to take on new challenges to help the Group grow. In 2018, 30 VIE participants were stationed primarily in Africa, Asia, North and South America.

  Finally, every year, the Group offers employees expatriation contracts in a number of different countries. In addition to sharing best practices and standardising working methods, international mobility gives employees exposure to more responsibility and the chance to widen their range of skills. 

  The programme involves discussions, conferences and targeted communications throughout the year, whereby employees learn about the interests of international mobility. In 2017, new programmes were introduced to attract, retain and develop the talents within the Group. The Sponsorship programme is aimed at accelerating and easing the integration of Executives. Mentoring is also available to support our talents in taking their job positions. These two programmes are based on establishing a special relationship, confidence and mutual respect, and allow experienced employees to share their knowledge of the Group, their network and their experience. 

  In 2019, focus will be placed on developing Mentoring within the company. A panel of managers will be invited to take part in an information session on Mentoring that will be coordinated by the Group Human Resources Department. At the end of this session, some of the managers, who have volunteered to take part in the programme, will receive a half-day of training on the

  role and responsibilities of the Mentor. As support, a group for discussion and sharing between mentors will be formed. 

  The Lead Program was continued in 2018, with: 

  • The launch of the 3 rd promotion deficated to the Americas (ended in late 

  2018); • The start of the 4 th promotion (24 participants for the Europe Middle East Africa region). This CMA CGM Corporate leadership training programme that was established as a partnership with Sciences Po Paris & Financial Times |E Business School CLA, is designed to prepare young Talents in managerial positions to cope with the future challenges of our industry and take up positions of responsibility. 

  Since its launch in 2017, 91 Group employees have taken part in this leadership programme, including 68 in 2018. Work is currently being conducted on the new directions to be given to the programme for 2019. 55

  Projet Feedback 360° In 2018, the Group decided to embark upon the development of an overall feedback culture in the company. 

  Feedback 360° is an individual development tool: 

  • Comparing self-perception (self-assess- ment) and colleagues’ perception serves to identify the strengths and areas for improvement of a participant whether he or she knows them; • The procedure is continued by an indiv- idual development plan around concrete actions. 

  The pilot project was launched with a portion of the Corporate Officers in Marseilles so that, in turn, they can become actors of the feedback culture within their organisation. 

  In implementing Feedback 360°, the company would like to institute a long- term process with the teams and enable individual and collective development.

  “Thomas International” questionnaire In France, CMA CCGM has been using the “Thomas International” questionnaire for the past several years as a tool for making good recruiting decisions. This assessment tool specifically describes the behavioural module of an individual in a work situation. The result gives rise to a constructive discussion with the candidate which confirms or disproves the analysis of his or her professional profile. The “Thomas APP” provides additional information which supplements the assessment made by the recruiter. All of the HR teams abroad have been trained in using the tool and propose it to all their candidates. In 2019, the “Team” version of the questionnaire will be tested in Marseilles. The “APP Team” questionnaire will serve to pool all the profiles of a team, create a profile therefrom and highlight the key points thereof (support points, comple- mentarity of the profiles, areas to be developed, etc.). Therefore, the tool and its analysis enable a better understanding of the various interactions of the team for better cooperation and to determine the avenues for making full use of its development potential. The operational HR teams in Marseilles will be trained in using the tool and will subsequently coordinate workshops with the various teams.

  Onboarding process Integration is an essential issue which has emerged as a driving force behind the retention and development of our new talents. It is a decisive period of the employee’s career which must be given our entire attention and requires the involvement of all stakeholders in the company. In 2017, the implementation of the “Onboarding” process the USA, and then in France, allowed the CMA CGM Group to professionalise the new employee orientation process. At present, even before arriving in the company, new employees receive special guidance for the accomplishment of administrative formalities and key information (via a digital portal) in order to foster adherence to the company’s culture and values. In 2019, the “Onboarding” process will be introduced in Singapore and the employees will have access to a new information portal which can now be consulted from C&Me. This new version of the digital portal will also be implemented in the US and in France in 2019.

  Espace MAPP CMA CGM is also a member of the Espace MAPP Association in the PACA region (Mobility and Career Guidance). Espace MAPP supports the inter-company mobility of employees from several locally influential companies through shared experiences or feedback enhanced by training sessions also conducted by the association, thereby offering a diverse range of career paths. 

  In 2018, a new concept “Talents & Territoires” was introduced in connection with Espace Mapp. “Talents & Territoires” is aimed at establishing contact between employees of major corporations with local SMEs/ start-up so that these companies can take advantage of the specific skills offered by the employees. In summary, the project is akin to a skills sponsorship programme by local corporations for the local economic environment. 

  Managing the careers of seagoing personnel: The fleet management department regularly monitors the careers of seagoing personnel. A briefing is held at each embarkation during which the validity of certificates is verified and a check is conducted to determine whether seafarers attended the mandatory training sessions. The Group is working to set up a “land-sea-land” career management system for officers of its owned fleet. They are given assignments at the head office to facilitate discussions between the various sectors and provide them with future career opportunities on shore.

  B. A competitive wage policy 

  In order to attract, retain and motivate talents, CMA CGM relies on a wage policy that has 3 priorities: • Equality within the company • External competitiveness • Performance-based remuneration 

  Since July 2016, as part of the integration of the APL teams, the CMA CGM Group has undertaken an overall approach to harmonise salaries and health insurance, welfare and pension schemes, in approximately 40 countries. This process was conducted via comparative studies regarding the levels (salary, social benefits) and the structures for the relevant countries. As a follow-up, an audit was initiated in late 2017 for all the Group companies. In 2018, the audit report provided an exhaustive assessment of the Group’s supplementary health care, welfare and pension schemes. 

  The approach to harmonise the health insurance and welfare schemes continued in 2018 and gave rise to the signature of an umbrella policy with an international broker on 1 December 2018. The broker’s scope will initially extend to 55 countries for which it will negotiate the policies or policy renewals for the Group (life insurance / disability and health care). 

  The CMA CGM Group is thereby demonstrating its desire to align the level of health and welfare coverage for the Group’s employees to market practices (similar industry), while taking into account unique local and regional characteristics. 

  For information, on 31/12/2018, the payroll amounted to: USD 1,886 M.

  Reform of the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system In 2018, the Group Human Resources Department wanted to assist all employees of the France scope in the transition process to the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system as of January 1, 2019 Therefore, in addition to the official campaign led by the Tax Authorities, at all the sites, the employees were invited to information sessions coordinated by Ernst & Young. The aim was to help them understand and anticipate the change, outline all the impacts of the reform and give them the opportunity to ask questions to a tax lawyer. 

  C. A strategic training policy 

  The Group’s training policy is part of a comprehensive strategy on career management and skills development. 

  The CMA CGM Group is committed to maintaining and strengthening the skills of its workforce. In 2018, the Group administered 212,342 hours of training to all its employees. The difference in the number of hours of training in 2017 and 2018 is due to a change in the method of calculating the training hours.

  

  59 Training 20 2018 

  Training of shore-based staff 85,067 

  Training of French seagoing staff 16,550 

  Training of international seagoing staff 110,725 

  Total number of hours of training 212,342 

  CMA CGM Academy helps all employees on a daily basis in all their job-related activities and offers a wide range of e-learning or classroom-based courses with an instructor to fulfil everyone’s needs. Its purpose is to guide the Group’s strategy particularly via strategic actions such as the strengthening of human expertise combined with an agile organisation. This is obtained through the administering of agile training courses to support the projects (raising awareness to the agile method, Lean Six Sigma, etc.). • In 2018, CMA CGM Academy organised Department and CMA CGM Academy introduced a new compulsory training module for the entire staff on the basic data protection rules. • The CMA CGM Group is currently deploying Office 365 suite to all employees. In addition to the Microsoft office automation tools (Word, Excel, etc.), Office 365 also offers new online collaborative services such as Teams and Yammer. To guide employees in their familiarisation with these tools, a set of video tutorials (from beginner to expert level) is available on the Academy portal. This is intended to help them broaden their knowledge of the new version of the office automation tools as well as to learn about the new tools which are fundamental to collaborative working. • In order to ensure optimum implementation of the various LISA training modules (SAP), CMA CGM Academy has put together, trained and guided a network of “Super Key Users” and “Key Users”. training on the IFRS 16 standard. This is a new international accounting standard for the finance teams (classroom and e-learning sessions), which must be 

  applied as of 1 January 2019. • All the Group’s operations worldwide are subject to rules on competition law. To deepen employees’ insight into these rules, CMA CGM Academy offers e-learning courses related to Competition 

  Compliance. • CMA CGM Academy offered employees an overview of the general anti-corruption laws and principles and, more generally, the laws and principles applicable in the 

  shipping sector. • The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) lays down strict rules for the handling, storage and processing of data. These rules apply to all CMA CGM companies worldwide which process the data of citizens and residents of the European Union. The Group Legal 

  20 The scope of the classroom training data corresponds to France shore-based and seagoing employees, i.e. 23.6% of the 2018 Group consolidated workforce // The scope of the distance training data corresponds to shore-based and World Crewing employees in C&Me, i.e. 94% of the 2018 Group consolidated workforce. It should be noted that the “training” data reporting process is being rendered more reliable with the ultimate goal of achieving a scope of 100% of the Group’s consolidated workforce. It is also worth noting that all the data related to the training of employees from all Group entities is ultimately intended to be collected by the C&Me tool. Finally, as the reporting methodology has changed for the calculation of distance training hours, the 2017 data was not reused as it could not be compared with the 2018 values.

**************************** Page 31****************************

  Certificate training programmes In 2018, the Academy also developed certificate training programmes for France. The development of this type of programme

  Launch of blended training courses In 2018, the Academy also focused on the development of innovative blended training courses at the head office and in the agencies.

  Creation of the LAB The Lab by CMA CGM was also created in 2017. It is an area dedicated to innovation and transformation. This disruptive working space is based on 4 pillars: > Imagine > Experiment > Create > Work together 

  The Lab offers a modular working area as well as digital equipment providing access to exclusive resources such as the work headed by the Academy’s teams in “Design Thinking” 21 mode. In 2018, the occupancy rate of the Lab was 72%. 

  D. Key partnerships

  Training for seagoing staff: 

  The Training for seagoing staff is based on STCW 2010 training courses (international convention that determines the required professional certificates for each onboard function), some of the certificates are renewed every 5 years after refresher training, and after some training courses needed for CMA CGM tools as requested by CMA Ships (internal software, techniques, safety, simulators, etc.).

  61

  requires a sizable investment from the company as well as the training organisations to comply with a stringent regulatory context. These comprehensive and professional development programmes are an asset for employees’ employability as their skills are valued and recognised by the certification. For example, the language certificate training courses are validated by TOIEC (Test of English for International Communication), the office automation training courses by TOSA (Test On Software Applications) and the managerial training courses by Titles such as Head of business administration and management issued by Kedge Business School.

  The blended courses combine various types of learning activities (e-learning, classroom- based, various resources). For example, the INSIGHT programme uses this type of training as it offers a course that is comprised of inspiring videos, e-learning modules prior to sessions and inter-sessions, as well as regular and fruitful interactions with the instructor and leader, via exercises to be handed in and co-development workshops. The same formula has been used for targeted training courses: sales representatives, maritime operational staff, line management controllers. 60

  The CMA CGM Group proactively pursues dialogue between higher education and business, so it forms close working relationships with universities and colleges. 

  In France, the CMA CGM Group formed active partnerships with Sciences Po Paris, HEC Paris, Kedge BS, Aix Marseilles Université, IAE Aix-en-Provence and IEP Aix-en-Provence. These agreements created official links between CMA CGM and these institutions, and provide a framework for the mutual commitments that they have made. The joint initiatives take the form of conferences, round-table discussions, CMA CGM industry experts speaking in university courses, and business projects, the Group’s participation in the examination committees or its taking part in opening ceremonies and gala evenings. 

  Outside of the agreement, the Group also conducts occasional partnership actions by attending conferences, round-table discussions and job fairs organised by top French universities (Grandes Ecoles) such as forums at ESCP, Polytechnique or EM Lyon. These events give the Group the opportunity to expose students to the business and the wide variety of jobs in the industry. 

  21 Design Thinking is an innovation and management approach that is considered as a synthesis between analytic thinking and intuitive thinking. It relies heavily on a co-creativity process involving feedback from the end user.

  The International Trade & Logistics Master’s Degree celebrates its 60 anniversary On the 60 th anniversary of the Interna - tional Trade & Logistics Master’s De- gree administered by Kedge Business School Marseilles, the CMA CGM Group attended a conference of ex - perts brought together to discuss “Land and sea silk roads, economic and geopolitical reflections on the China, India, Russia relations”. Over the years, CMA CGM and Kedge Bu - siness School have developed a close partnership specifically due to this master’s course which is designed to develop the skills of future managers / leaders in the international trade and logistics sector. This is a key ele - ment for the company which is always on the lookout for new talents. 62

  Hosting of 10 th grade interns at the head office Throughout the year, the CMA CGM Group hosts young high school students in Marseilles as part of their 10th grade internship entitled “Discovery of the world of work”. Exclusively reserved for the children of employees, this initiative is highly popular with the employees of the head office. It is a means for them to introduce their children to their working environment and for the children to find out what their parents’ jobs entail. It is also a way for the company to provide insight into its operations and increase its local presence. In 2018, the company also welcomed pupils from the priority education area (ZEP – Zone d’Éducation Prioritaire) to do their 10 th grade internship at the facility in Marseilles. Accordingly, several periods were identified during the year to guarantee optimum organisation and make them feel especially welcome in the company. As of 31/12/2018, over sixty 10 th grade interns have been hosted at the head office. Furthermore, in 2018, the CMA CGM Group and the local Education Authority signed an innovative partnership introducing teaching of maritime transport in secondary schools. The CMA CGM Group is delighted to have the opportunity to share its shipping experience and expertise with the teaching staff and students. Therefore, 2018 saw visits from groups of students and their teachers to the site in order to learn about the Group, its business operations and its wide variety of jobs in an international context.

  Fostering creative cooperation with Thecamp Thecamp, located close to Aix-en- Provence, is a campus for innovation and interaction dedicated to the city of tomorrow and digital transformation. It is a unique and extraordinary place where students at the end of their studies and professionals go to receive training and information (training courses, conferences, meet-ups, hackathons, events, collaborative projects, etc.). 

  As a private partner and founder of Thecamp, CMA CGM takes its employees there throughout the year, to get inspiration and to imagine, anticipate and build a desirable future that is being made possible by new technologies. – cf page 24 – Key partnerships signed.

  E. An efficient information system 

  Since 2014, the Human Resources information system, C&Me, has been helping standardise HR processes around the world. This tool offers greater visibility of all HR programmes (mobility, development, training courses) and fosters better performing and more detailed management of human resources through elements such as objectives and skills management. Lastly, it encourages employees to be more proactive and effective in their careers. 

  Subsequent to the roll-out of “Talent Performance” in 2015, two other modules were added to the C&Me HR series in 2016, providing HR teams and managers with the necessary leeway to steer the teams and manage resources: 

  • “Talent Acquisition”, dedicated to recruiting 

  and internal mobility; • “Talent Management”, career management tool. 

  The entire recruiting process is now paperless, from the recruitment request to the selected candidate’s joining the company. C&Me allows managers to monitor the progress of their requests as well as their recruitments. They are able to review the application and assess them online. It is also a new talent management initiative which is being offered to provide better support to HR and managers in their day-to-day activities: talent acquisition, training, performance, development and mobility. 

  All the HR processes have been reviewed through C&Me, making them simpler, more standardised and leaner and thereby more in line with the key issues at stake for the Group.

  In 2017, two new modules were deployed: 

  • “On Boarding”, dedicated to the integration of new employees. With the roll-out of this new module in the USA and in France, the entire integration process is now paperless, from the performance of administrative formalities to the provision of practical information provided to employees even 

  before their first day at the company; • “Work Force Analytics” is a reporting tool that offers each HR BP synthetic information and key indicators depending on his or her scope. 

  This tool also offers a new approach for the extraction of C&Me data with reliable indicators shared by all the countries where it has been introduced. 

  The roll-out of C&Me continued in 2018 to reach over 30,000 employees managed in the tool across more than 80 countries. The roll-out mainly related to the Africa region and some subsidiaries recently integrated within the Group. 

  2018 ended with the implementation of the new C&Me interface ensuring a better user experience for the Group employees (simplified design, more intuitive interface, compatibility with mobile terminals, etc.). 

  In 2019, the “Onboarding” module will be introduced in Singapore and the new digital portal will be migrated to the US and in France. The Group recruiting portal will also be entirely redesigned and will receive a new ergonomy to guarantee enhanced user experience (clearer view of openings at the Group, compatibility with mobile telephones, etc.).

  The severity of the maritime events is classified based on a matrix rated from A to D, with D being a serious event. This matrix takes into account 4 major categories of impacts: 

  • Impacts on the health and safety of the 

  vessel and the crew; • Environmental impact; • Impact on the public; • Financial impact. 

  Between 2017 and 2018, the major maritime events, rated D, slightly increased from 5 to 8.

  Number of major maritime 5 8 events 

  In 2018, 8 major maritime events (D) were recorded: 

  • On CMA CGM TIGRIS , a kilogram of cocaine was discovered on the deck by the dockers. The vessel was detained for 1 week by the Chinese authorities to conduct an investigation. The investigation proved that the crew was

  • On CMA CGM VOLGA , the ship’s cook was found dead in his cabin due to a

  attack. • On APL SOUTHAMPTON collided with a fishing boat of the coast of China. The fishing boat sank, resulting in the death 

  of 2 seafarers. • On APL SOUTHAMPTON , a lieutenant was found dead. This death was due to 

  suicide. • On CMA CGM G. WASHINGTON , 138 containers were lost at sea in the Pacific 

  due to bad weather. • CMA CGM NORMA collided with a ship in China. The other ship sank without causing any injuries. 

  The SSE department carried out investigations subsequent to each of these events to determine the causes and recommend corrective actions to avoid their re-occurrence.

  Fleet Navigation Center: state-of-the-art technological resources Modern technological resources such as those related to the weather are developed in-house by the expert captains of the Fleet Centers in order to mitigate navigation- related risks. These resources are then provided to the captains and officers onboard the Group’s Vessels and include navigation aid systems or decision-making systems for navigation during bad weather. At the centres located in Marseilles, Singapore and Miami, experienced ship captains constantly track the routes, analyse risks and advise and support the fleet vessels as well as the Group’s operational staff. 

  The navigation centres are also tasked with ensuring optimum piloting practices in terms of Fuel consumption, compliance with ship speeds in whale reproduction areas, compliance with the regulated navigation areas. To this end, the experts at the centres have developed innovative piloting methods, as well as methods for the kinematic monitoring of the vessels associated with powerful analysis tools

  vessels, to study navigation-related risks and to proactively set the rules of access to the ports. Indeed, this involves adjusting the cargo capacity in order to guarantee economic profitability while constantly preserving the vessels, crews and the port environment. Therefore, the rules of access concern the sizes of the ships (length, width and draught), the necessary support equipment (such as tugboats) as well as the acceptable hydrometeorological conditions (tides, currents, wind). In similar fashion, feedback is collected so as to provide the successive ship’s captains with the most up- to-date and relevant information possible. 

  Search and rescue Because of the vastness of the oceans, the various players in the shipping industry have to work together to rescue people in danger. At whatever time, the vessels may have to be diverted to lend assistance to another ship in distress. These operations are Search & Rescue (SAR) operations. In 2018, 13 operations were carried out by vessels in the owned fleet.

This year, a new tool was developed to anticipate Deadlines and congestions in order to reduce as early as possible the speed and waiting time before the ports and thereby lessen the Carbon footprint via innovative actions.

  Stowaways Measures have been put in place onboard ships in order to prevent the boarding of stowaways, make regular searches to detect their potential presence and, as applicable, to manage the stowaways found on board. These procedures have been included in the Ship Security Plan (SSP), which is set by the International Ship and Port facility Security (ISPS) code.

  A proven crisis management plan 

  Although the CMA CGM safety management procedures are mainly preventive, the Group also has a comprehensive plan for managing crisis situations. This plan contains responses to emergency situations onboard ships as well as at the branches and terminals. The plan is tested at least once per year and routine training sessions are conducted to improve the response capabilities of the crisis management teams. In addition, the Group carries out regular drills in conjunction with the authorities to prepare for potentially dangerous events. These include pirate attack simulations, emergency towing, fire and pollution.

  In the event of a crisis, the affected entity will firstly call the 24/7 emergency hotline where it will be put in touch with the person on call. This person will inform the various departments of the situation, and based on the severity of the event, will decide to start a crisis unit bringing together all the relevant parties. There is a dedicated room for this purpose in Marseilles and Singapore with all the necessary means of communication. The crisis will therefore be managed from this room. Once the crisis has been resolved, an investigation will be carried out to determine the causes of the problem and to draw lessons therefrom in order to avoid recurrence of the same event.

  2. Occupational health and safety 

  The Group’s prevention policy revolves around risks analyses of safety and working conditions. This is a process of continuous improvement whereby all players, from Top Management to seagoing staff and operational staff, are involved on a day-to- day basis. 

  The vessels of the owned fleet sail under different state flags, in international waters with seafarers from different cultures and nationalities. As a result, the standardisation of the procedures and practices within our fleet has become a major issue. With this in mind, the Accident Prevention Committee (APC) was created. This committee meets regularly and reviews results concerning health and safety, regulatory changes, feedback from the vessels and innovations which may improve safety onboard the vessels. 

  At the various maritime, inland or shore- based entities and in accordance with applicable regulations, all risks are identified, assessed and covered annual prevention

  Every quarter, feedback on the events which occurred on board (accidents, near misses and inspections) is compiled and discussed among the owned fleets. This gives seafarers the opportunity to draw from each other’s experiences and put them in a better position to anticipate risks. 

  Training and awareness campaigns are crucial components of prevention. They revolve around compulsory job-related training courses, knowledge-building sessions on land, on board, at the work station, remote training tool and catalogue for seagoing staff, special training courses for all second officers as well as a programme of regular drills and navigation simulators. Seminars are held at the head office and attended by officers from all the Group’s fleets. Attendees discuss a range of operational and onboard safety-related topics (analysis of reported events, safety management, etc.). Furthermore, the Group is an active member of the CSSF – Container Ship Safety Forum. This non-governmental organisation which was started in 2014 brings together major shipping players with the aim of improving safety performance and container shipping management practices.

  Shipping 26 2017 2018 

  Frequency 0.9 1.25 rate of work accidents - with sick leave 

  Fatal accidents 1 27 0 28 

  For the maritime scope, the frequency rate of accidents increased in 2018 compared with 2017, with a rate of 1.25 in 2018 against 0.9 in 2017, with a constantly growing number of vessels each year. There were more accidents in 2018, however they were less severe and involved shorter absences. 

  In 2018, the Severity Rate was integrated as a performance indicator for vessels. This rate measures the number of days sick leave further to a work accident per thousand of hours worked. For 2018, the score was 0.2.

  The accidents onboard vessels involving seagoing staff are not the only ones counted by the Company. The accidents affecting shore-based staff working on board are also monitored and are reported and analysed. 

  Work accidents with leave of more than 24 hours and/or near misses considered very serious are routinely investigated to analyse the causes and to introduce the appropriate corrective and preventive actions. 71

  plans. These prevention plans address various themes such as personal protection equipment, chemical risks, psychosocial risks, addictions and noise exposure. 

  The main health and safety risks to the employees differ based on the business activities: 

  Shipping activities Terminal activities 

  • Fire / explosion • Collisions between machinery and pedestrians 

  • Falls from height or • Falls from height tripping and falling 

  • Risks associated with • Manual handling manual handling operations

  Frequency 19.1 13.2 rate of work accidents - with sick leave 

  Fatal accidents 0 1 

  The frequency rate of work accidents with sick leave at the terminals managed by the Group decreased in one year due to an efficient prevention policy for the entire scope. 2018 saw an increase in the volumes and operations of the terminals. However, the risk assessment approach implemented at the terminals serves to decrease the work accidents with sick leave. In 2018, a fatal accident occurred at one of our terminals. It was a collision between a pedestrian, employed at the terminal, and a handling vehicle that was reversing at the time. The victim died further to the injuries sustained.

  In early 2019, an improved upgrade of our IT application will make it possible to respond in almost real time to over 60% of the requests for the loading onto our vessels of dangerous goods under the Group’s shipping contracts while retaining the current level of safety. At present, the timeframe is approximately one working day. 

  With regard to potentially dangerous goods, i.e. which may represent a risk such as the out-of-size or conventional loads, reefers, flexitanks, poorly declared goods, the Group has provided its in-house customers with 3 experts who are tasked with providing safety advice to the lines and agencies. 

  As regards the goods with controlled movement, the 3 aforementioned experts are responsible for advising the lines, the agencies and the dangerous goods offices.

  Finally, the CMA CGM Group uses its best endeavours to prevent unlawful carriage of goods in accordance with the various regulations and the Group’s Code of Ethics. This mainly relates to goods on the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) red list of threatened species, those covered by Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) or the Washington convention, the United Nations Convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, and various UN rules on embargoed goods.

  4. International security At sea With the aim of preventing threats at sea and as a means of coping therewith, CMA CGM has developed a comprehensive range of operational, legal and human measures. These measures are constantly reassessed and tailored to the changing security context (piracy, traffic, etc.). Therefore, the risk of piracy is continuously monitored and analysed, and each solution is tailored to appropriately respond to the identified hot bed of piracy (West Africa, Indian Ocean, South-East Asia, etc.). In 2018, approximately 266 piracy events were recorded worldwide, 223 of which included confirmed pirate attacks. Of these 223 attacks, most took place in South-East

  On land For the past several years, CMA CGM has developed an overall inland security policy. This policy uses relevant and appropriate measures and equipment to reduce the exposure to security, health, natural and technological risks by the Group’s business activities and staff across the globe. Accordingly, CMA CGM seeks to optimally safeguard and protect everyone’s safety For example, the countries around the world are categorised into various criticality levels, depending on the risks identified in each country. For each country, appropriate measures are introduced to secure the Group’s site as well as to protect the employees whether they are local, expatriates or on assignment. Within the Group, 85 countries have been categorised as high risk. Any traveller going to these countries must be registered with the Group Security Department, and briefed as applicable. In 2018, some 1,000 visits to high-risk countries were managed in this way. Moreover, in 2017, the Group had to cope

  Active involvement of CMA CGM within the BASCAP The Group works closely with recognised organisations to fight against counterfeiting and arms trafficking, such as for example the BASCAP – Business Actions to Stop Counterfeiting & Piracy. 

  Active involvement of CMA CGM within the CINS

  75

  These situations related to natural disasters, armed conflicts, threats against a number of employees and emergency medical evacuation.

  The Group is a founding member of the Cargo Incident Notification System (CINS), an information sharing platform for large maritime companies (70% of carried TEUs) that enables rapid notifications of security and safety issues with container-transported goods. This system has already significantly improved the quality of transporting goods in containers. To fight against false declarations, the 17 CINS member companies took the initiative to set up a joint system to detect poorly declared loads in order to improve the overall safety of container ships.

  Active involvement by CMA CGM within CINDEX Cindex (inter-company expatriation centre) is a place for dialogue and sharing of good practices on international mobility strategies and policies by a network of major European groups. Each member benefits from the experience of the others, while maintaining full freedom of action and decisions, and observing absolute confidentiality. It is an informal network between peers, based on pooled knowledge and trust. The fact that Cindex co-opts its members guarantees a genuine sharing of concerns.

  Environmental protection 76

  General 

  Environmental protection is a key focus of the CMA CGM Group’s commit- ment to sustainable and responsible development. Major key issues for the Group include the conti- nued reduction of the global environmental footprint of all maritime and inland operations, regulatory compliance and above all the an- ticipation of future regulations, and the development of more eco-efficient logistics chains with its customers and partners.

  The CMA CGM Group’s environmental policy relies on 3 strategic axes: 

  • Air : climate change and air quality • Oceans : ocean preservation and marine biodiversity • Innovation : innovative and environmentally-friendly solutions 

  Inauguration of CMA CGM ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPERY 

  In September 2018, CMA CGM inaugurated its flag ship, CMA CGM ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPERY , the largest container ship in the world flying the French flag: • A 20,600-TEU (Twenty foot Equivalent Unit) capacity; • End-to-end, the 20,656 TEUs represent a 123 kilometre 

  long chain of containers; • 400-metre long and 59-metre wide; • Longer than 4 football fields and bigger than the Empire State Building and the Eiffel Tower.

  The CMA CGM Group has decided to use Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to power its next nine giant 22,000-TEU ships which will be commissioned in 2020. For the first time in the history of container shipping, a shipping company has made the ambitious choice of a cutting-edge technology for its large-capacity vessels. 

  The building of the first ship in the series was officially launched with the “steel cutting” ceremony held on 26 July at Jiangnan Shipbuilding in Shanghai, China.

  Containerships CMA CGM has continued its external growth strategy with the acquisition of CONTAINERSHIPS. In early 2019, 4 new LNG-powered 1,400-TEU vessels will enter the fleet. This opportunity confirms our desire for innovation and our choices in favour of LNG and also expands our skills and future experiences from building to the first bunkers. 79

  Exhaust gas treatment systems On 30 March 2018, the Group took delivery of CMA CGM PREGOLIA, a 2,500-TEU Ice Class vessel assigned to the Baltic sea. It is the first vessel of the fleet to be equipped with a scrubber. This investment is mainly driven by the fact that the vessel will serve at navigation zone exclusively situated in the Sulphur Emission Control Area (ECA). This system scrubs the exhaust gases, thereby capturing the Sulphur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) particles. These releases are then retained to be reprocessed on land. The fleet of scrubber-ready vessels has been supplemented with the entry into service of CMA CGM NEVA and CMA CGM LOUGA.

  1. AIR: Energy transition By the very nature of the transport business, which relies heavily of fossile fuels, energy consumption remains a major issue. It is an economic, environmental and public health challenge for the Group and is carefully monitored by its various entities. The Group’s energy consumption is directly associated with the level of both greenhouse gas and polluting air emissions. Climate change is a major issue that in the long run will result in more technical, regulatory, financial and operational restrictions, yet will also give rise to new opportunities for responsible and sustainable marine transport. The CMA CGM Group now holds market leadership for innovation in energy transition.

  A. Energy consumption 

  Indicators 2017 2018 

  7 783 8 259 6% Fuel consumption of the maritime fleet 29 ktons 

  Energy / loaded 413 399 - 3% TEU 30 kg/ TEU 

  In 2018, the fuel consumption for the CMA CGM Group’s maritime activity was 8,259 ktons, i.e. 6% higher than in 2017. With regard to energy efficiency, we reported a net improvement in the amount of fuel per container carried that equals a 3% decrease over 2017. 

  For many years now, the Group has conducted several initiatives to reduce fuel consumption which include replacing the fleet, monitoring consumption, reducing speed, optimising routes and improving propulsion and hydrodynamic technology. 

  - More specifically, in 2013, CMA CGM launched a programme to optimise its owned fleet primarily by modifying its bulbus bows. These changes were done in dry dock and help to maximise the ship’s hydrodynamics at applied speeds. 64 ships have already been modified, 4 of which in 2018. This innovation can cut fuel use and 

  also a propeller change programme whose design enables energy optimisation. In 2018, 25 propellers were changed.

  - Another example of efforts to reduce energy consumption is CMA Ships’ limiting the capacities of the main engines of its largest vessels to adapt to the current navigation speeds. - In 2018, the Group introduced a programme to install recovery boilers for the auxiliary engines (as for the main engine). Indeed instead of burning oil to produce the necessary steam, the boiler will recover the heat from the auxiliary engines exhaust gases, even when the main engine is shutdown. This technology has been installed on vessels. 

  The Navigation Support Centres’ role is to anticipate extreme weather events and advise Captains in choosing a route and minimising the consumption of our vessels. 3 “Fleet centers” covering all the time zones are manned 24/7 by seagoing personnel assigned to the shore-based facilities. Moreover, a Group operations department has been set up in order to optimise all the Group’s operations (maritime and operational management of the ships, decrease of port congestion, optimisation of the CMA CGM sea and land network).

  b. Overall assessment of the Group’s CO 2 emissions 

  The main source of greenhouse gas emissions of the CMA CGM Group is the combustion of fuel oil consumed by the vessels which represents more than 85% of the Group’s total energy balance. Energy consumption (mainly electricity) in relation to shore activities (agencies and terminals) is not significant in comparison with the consumption of the shipping fleet. The main indirect sources of CO 2 emissions for 

  the vessels operated by the Group as well as the production of fuel oil used onboard the vessels. In 2018, scope 3 represented approximately 14% of the Group’s CO 2 emissions.

  c. Clean Cargo 

  Through the Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG), a discussion and collaboration platform, maritime carriers and major shippers are helping develop standard methods to calculate air emissions in the sector. The working group represents over 80% of container shipping capacity. CMA CGM has been an active member since 2003. Based on the methodology set up within the CCWG and to meet regulatory requirements and customer needs, in 2008, CMA CGM set

  In addition to CO 2 , the Group is very 

  nitrogen oxides emissions and fine particulates. Since these emissions create issues for public health and air quality, increasingly stricter international and local regulations are being in force. 

  a. Global Sulphur Cap 2020 In October 2016, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) set a 0.5% cap for the sulphur contained in the fuel used onboard ships that will enter into force on 1 January 2020. This will reduce the quantity of sulphur oxide from vessels by 85% and should have a significant impact on improving air quality, particularly for the populations living close to ports and coasts. This regulation is subsequent to the implementation of Annex VI of the MARPOL convention for the prevention of air pollution from ships. The Group has set up a dedicated working group (Countdown 2020 WorkGroup) aggregating representatives from many departments at the head office (Bunkering, Operational Management, Sales Representatives, Environmental Department, Legal Department, etc.) who are tasked with anticipating all the issues related with this new regulatory obligation to ensure compliance by the Group: purchase of fuel oil, cleaning of the tanks, procurement prospects, etc.

  CMA CGM pre-empts and studies all technological solutions to ensure its compliance such as the use of low sulphur fuel, installing scrubber systems or any other alternative such as LNG propulsion.

  our suppliers; > Ordering of 9 LNG-powered vessels; > Delivery taken of three 2,500-TEU ships equipped with hybrid scrubber systems On 30 March 2018, the Group took delivery of CMA CGM PREGOLIA Ice Class, a 2,500- TEU vessels assigned to the Baltic line. It is the first vessel of the fleet to be equipped with a scrubber. The Group opted for a hybrid scrubber which can operate in open loop or in closed loop. This investment is mainly driven by the fact that the vessel will serve a navigation zone exclusively situated in the sulphur Emission Control Area (ECA). This system scrubs the exhaust gases, thereby capturing the sulphur oxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) particles. These releases are then retained to be reprocessed on land. The fleet of scrubber-ready vessels have been supplemented with the entry into service of CMA CGM NEVA and CMA CGM LOUGA. CMA CGM is conducting 3 pilot projects to install this technology on its large vessels. Indeed, even though this scrubber technology has been proven in the land industry, it must be adapted to the high powers of our vessels. 

  In 2018, the average rate of sulphur in the fuel oil purchased by the Group was 2.42%.

  b. Shore connection 

  In California, since 2014, local regulations require maritime companies to use shore power instead of using on-board engines. The initial threshold of 50% was increased to 70% in 2017, thereby reducing fuel consumption and inherent air emissions by an additional 20%. To ensure regulatory compliance of our vessels and calls, thirty of CMA CGM ships were equipped with alternative shore power systems. Our vessels fited with this technology connect to shore in China on a voluntary basis in the ports which are equipped with this system. Due to this technology, some 28,000 tons of CO 2 , 14 tons of SOx and 35 tons of PM10 

  The Group is studying the possibility of shore connection to standalone systems supplying the electricity produced on site with gas turbines.

  c. Emission Control Areas 

  To date, there are 3 main areas where sulphur emissions from vessels are regulated: Northern Europe, North Amercia and, since 2018, China. 

  China has established Emission Control Areas (ECA) in its territorial waters, in order to handle the recurrent problem of air pollution. This environmental programme took effect on 1 April 2016 and requires vessels to use low sulphur fuel. Since 1 April 2016, the Group’s vessels calling at the Shanghai, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Suzhou and Nantong ports must switch to a fuel with less than 0.5% sulphur content at anchorage and at berth. Since 1 January 2018, the obligation to use 0.5% fuel oil has been generalised to all Chinese ports. 

  The next stage of the Chinese environmental programme will take effect on 1 January 2019. Indeed, all vessels shall be obliged to burn fuel oil with a sulphur content of maximum 0.5% whenever they enter the Emission Control Areas. All of the Group’s vessels comply with the Chinese requirements, the necessary bunker purchases are anticipated in order to guarantee full compliance upon entry into force of the new requirements.

  In 2018, the fleet’s SOx and NOx emissions were respectively 400,000 tons and 699,811 tons. 

  D. Alternative energy The IMO’s decisions to limit the sulphur content of the fuel used by vessels as of 1 January 2020 to 0.5% and the ambitious strategy recently adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% in 2050 have directed the sector towards the search for alternative solutions to conventional fuel. In fact, there is clear global phenomenon towards the reduction of CO 2 , NOx, SOx 

  In light of these challenges, energy transition is a major issue for the shipping industry as a whole and the CMA CGM Group in particular. The main challenges associated with the use of these alternative fuel solutions lie in the compatibility of their various environmental benefits with regard to pollution, the availability of the required quantities for the sector and the cost of the fuel. The most promising solutions are LNG,

  biofuels and hydrogen. Fuel cells, batteries and wind power are interesting options which must be considered as secondary or back-up sources. The CMA CGM Group decided on LNG by ordering 9 LNG-powered 22,000 TEU vessels. LNG has many environmental advantages in comparison to heavy fuel oil, such as the significant lowering of CO 2 emissions, the 

  the substantial reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and fine particulates. As a true technological breakthrough in support of environmental protection, compared with the current fuel-powered vessels, LNG offers: 

  • The reduction of 99% of sulphur emissions; • The reduction of 99% of fine particulate emissions; • The reduction of 85% of nitrogen oxide emissions. The vessels powered by LNG will comply with IMO regulation aimed at reducing sulphur emissions as from 2020. These new vessels are the culmination of over 7 years of work by our expert teams, and ship building engineers, our seagoing personnel as well as close cooperation with many technical and port partners. 

  Alongside the building of new vessels, CMA CGM carried out risk assessments in coordination with the shipyard, the classification society and stakeholders in the project to ensure proper conduct of the project particularly in terms of the environment. To guarante the smooth progress of the project, risk mitigation measures were listed and should be

  At the same time, the biofuel, hydrogen and wind propulsion (Kite) solutions are also being studied as the Group’s experts are convinced that the solution to the energy transition challenges lies in combining the technologies. 

  As part of a partnership with Yves Parlier and his company “Beyond the sea”, tests have been carried out to assess the feasibility of the Kite rig ship pulling system of the Group’s vessels. 

  2. OCEANS: preserving biodiversity 

  A. Accidental release to the sea and containers lost at sea Accidental releases to the sea and in particular oil pollution from vessels or terminals operated by the Group are the biggest threat to the environment. A set of measures is in place to prevent this risk, such as fleet maintenance, routine drills and simulations between land and the vessels, and a strong crisis management policy. There are several types of marine pollution: • Fuel; • Oil; • Chemicals; • Sludge.

  buckets, portable pump, absorbent pads, gloves, bags, etc. Liquid releases are controlled with instruments that comply with regulations, such as the oily water separator. It is used to control the maximum concentration of oil in the water released at sea when the vessel is en route, i.e. 15 ppm. Moreover, certain vessels feature a separator that is only 5 ppm. Human management and procedures are fundamental in the prevention of pollution. 

  The teams have entered into partnerships with: • The Bataillon des Marins Pompiers (Naval Fire Brigade): firefighting and pollution exercises are organised on board as part of a commitment to continued improvement; • The Cedre (Centre de documentation, de recherche et d'expérimentations sur les pollutions accidentelles des eaux - Centre for documentation, research and experimentation accidental water pollution). This centre is based in Brest (France) and CMA CGM personnel receives training there on an annual basis; • Specific organisations, such as ECM, acting as the point of contact between the Group and the American Coast Guards.

  Number of events 35 which led to accidental releases to the sea 36 in 2018: • A single event had a moderate impact on the environment. It involved fuel leakage 

  during refuelling; • Five other releases to the sea were reported but involved a low risk. 

  Indicators 2017 2018 

  Loss of containers at sea 37 

  According to the World Shipping Council 38 , 2,000 containers were lost at sea worldwide every year from 2006 to 2013 primarily due to difficult navigation conditions or a rare accident. In 2018, the CMA CGM Group recorded the loss of 139 containers at sea, of which 138 in a single event during a storm. 

  The loss of containers at sea is generally associated with the shipper’s declaring a lower weight of the container. The risk is also increased by bad weather. Every effort is made to prevent losing containers: weather watch, navigation centre, weather routing, onboard container security system. The CMA CGM Group began talks with Armateurs de France (French shipping association) and the relevant authorities to further reduce the risk of losing containers at sea. – cf page 73 – Cargo Security . 

  B. Biodiversity: protection of cetaceans

  and fauna While the issue of protecting biodiversity mainly stems from managing the risk of liquid releases or solid waste at sea, container ships can potentially impact biodiversity due to the pollution caused to marine species. 

  a. Cetaceans and sea mammals Several programmes have been set up in the United States and Canada for the protection of cetaceans. On the East coast, CMA CGM’s vessels must reduce their speed to maximum 10 knots in certain areas recognised as the breeding sites of cetaceans. 

  In addition, on the West coast of the United States, CMA CGM has voluntarily committed to the “Green Flag” speed reduction programme that was established in the sanctuary close to the Santa Barbara islands. The Long Beach port has rewarded CMA CGM for lowering the speed of its container ships with a compliance rate of almost 100%. 

  Furthermore, with support from the “Fleet Navigation Center”, the Group watches out for the areas where it is recommended to lower the speed of vessels. Whenever possible, the Group strives to lower its speed and thereby limit the risk of collision in these cetacean protection sanctuaries. – cf page 69 – Fleet Navigation Center: state- of-the-art technological resources.

  35 Events identified irrespective of CMA CGM’s level of liability. 36 Excluding containers lost at sea (reported further on). 37 The containers lost by the CMA CGM owned vessels are taken into account, the containers lost by chartered or partner vessels are excluded. It should be noted that the containers which fell into the waters of a port and then were recovered are not counted. 38 Survey Results for Containers Lost At Sea – 2014 Update- World Shipping Council.

  b. Endangered species To limit the carriage of endangered species, the Group has set up procedures during the order intake process by which staff can give an alert to this type of cargo. – cf page 73 – Cargo Security

  CMA CGM preempted the entry into force of this convention by installing ballast water treatment systems on most new vessels, thereby ensuring that the water released to the sea is fully free of any living organism which may affect the marine biodiversity. 

  The United States have also implemented local regulations on the treatment of ballast water. It approved 6 ballast water treatment systems that comply with American regulations, which are more stringent than international regulations. The CMA CGM vessels are equipped with approved systems and must treat their ballast water via one of these systems before releasing them into American waters.

  3. Circular economy Circular economy refers to an economic concept which forms part of sustainable development and which is aimed at producing goods and services while limiting consumption and the waste of raw materials, water and energy sources. As a shipping and logistics operator, CMA CGM is an active player of the circular economy by providing services at all phases involved in the transport of raw materials, intermediate and finished consumer goods as well as end-of-life products, depending on the needs of its customers. The Group pays special attention to the responsible use of resources, raw materials and consumables.

  C. Eco-technologies 

  a. Ballast water treatment system Ballasts are tanks filled with sea water located on both sides of a vessel which are used to ensure stability and structural integrity. The ballast water contains living species which, when released, may disrupt the balance of the local fauna and flora. The IMO ballast water management convention adopted in February 2004 was ratified in 2016 and took effect on 8 September 2017. 88

  connections, to quickly recover the oil located in the vessel bunkers in the event of grounding,. This technology has been installed on 57 vessels. Up until 2010, the fuel oil of container ships was generally stored in tanks with a single hull. Since the MARPOL 12A rule (circa. 2010) took effect, they are now equipped with a double hull. As a matter of fact, the installation of a second wall, around the fuel tanks, prevents the risks of maritime pollution in the event of collision or piercing of the ship’s hull. Additional tanks, installed during the building of our new vessels, make it possible to better process bilge water and grey water.

  A. Recycling solution and waste treatment process 

  A variety of waste is produced by the fleet: • Solid waste made up of food waste, 

  domestic waste, maintenance waste; • Liquid waste from sewage, oily water and sludge. 

  a. Solid waste The Group has committed to an innovative, environmentally-friendly and exemplary approach to exceed the requirements of the MARPOL regulation: the “Green Ship” Programme. All the Group’s owned vessels now take part in this programme, i.e. 179 vessels. 

  39 18,448 = production of solid waste reported for 2017.

  This initiative is structured around four key aspects: ➊ Selective sorting of all waste; ➋ The replacement of incinerators by new-generation compactors, thereby 

  preventing the emission of polluting gases; ➌ The formal prohibition of disposing of 

  waste overboard (excluding food waste); ➍ Optimisation of waste recycling systems 

  on shore. Therefore, the quantities of waste produced are monitored, updated and reported, and specific training sessions are conducted onboard the ships as well as on land. Indicators 2017 2018 Production of solid waste by the owned fleet Thousands of tons

**************************** Page 46****************************

  In 2018, a ship produced an average of 10 m 3 of solid waste per month. 

  The programme also enables vessels to share “good practices” or “issues encountered”. As such, the ports collecting the waste for recovery are listed by the type of waste they collect (ink cartridges, plastics, etc.); while other ports are not recommended. The goal is to draw up a central map of ports that provide the best selective sorting process. 

  In addition, the programme also makes it possible to set up waste treatment systems. This year, a mapping of the companies able to treat asbestos waste, as well as electrical and electronic waste, based on the best available techniques, had to be drawn up. This documentary system for the management of waste on board has been amended to take into account these 2 new types of special waste. In particular, it includes a module to train and inform seagoing personnel of these new risks for their health and the environment. 

  b. Liquid waste Liquid waste is primarily due to the use of fuel oil. Vessels run on “residual” fuel that contains water and heavy metals. To be combustible, it has to be centrifuged on board. The centrifugation process requires water to be added to the water and heavy metals extracted from the fuel. All this waste creates “sludge” which is considered as hazardous waste. It is discharged on land and managed by land-based waste streams. CMA CGM takes care of the sludge generated by the owned fleet but it depends on the charter party for chartered vessels. It may be managed by the ship owner or the charterer. 

  A special team was put together in June 2015 to monitor the discharging of sludge which served to refine the method for assessing the quantity of sludge produced. For 2018, a ratio of 2.3% of the fuel oil consumed was defined to assess the total quantity produced. 90

  Indicators 2017 2018 Variation 

  Production of total 187 190 2% 

  The waste production from the CMA CGM Group’s offices and branches is comparable to standard office activities. The waste generated at dry ports and terminals mainly involves non-hazardous waste (pallets, wood, shrink wrap) and accounts for less than 1,200 m 3 per year within the Group’s scope of consolidation (Finance). 

  B. Dismantling of vessels 

  Considering current dismantling practices and the materials used to build the ships, the end of life of ships is potentially a major 

  Systematic inventory of hazardous substances on board 

  END-OF-LIFE SHIPS 

  Dismantling sites audited and certified in line with the guidelines required by the Hong Kong Convention 

  issue for the industry. Pending the ratification of the Hong Kong international convention, in 2008, the Group began establishing inventories of hazardous materials (IHM) on board, which will eventually be compulsory. The Group has proactively undertaken a vast plan to install or update the IHM for the entire owned fleet. The Group is continuing its regulatory and technical watch, as well

  as research with dismantling sites in Europe and Asia. The sites can be audited in accordance with the guidelines as stipulated in the Hong Kong Convention. It should be noted that the Group’s fleet is one of the youngest in the industry and the vessels are usually sold before their end of life. Nevertheless, whenever a vessel must be sent for dismantling, the Group takes measures to send it to a dismantling site that complies with international and local health, safety and environmental regulatory standards. In 2018, one Group vessel was sent to a certified site for dismantling in accordance with international standards, this vessel was the APL PHILIPPINES (aged 21 years). 

  C. Water consumption at the terminals 

  Water consumption is not a significant issue for the CMA CGM Group’s maritime transport activity. Indeed, water consumption on ships is neutral as sea water is pumped in, desalinated and treated for everyday uses on board. 

  For the Terminals, water consumption is mainly associated to the washing of handling vehicles, the quays and containers. Most of the sites are located close to other port industries which produce a lot of dust, thereby requiring frequent washing of the working environments. In 2018, within the Group’s scope of consolidation, total water consumption amounted to 214,896 m 3 . 

  Indicateurs 2017 41 2018 42 Variation 

  Water 97,441 214,896 + 120% 

  The significant increase in water consumption is due to a broadening of the scope and the heightened exhaustiveness of data collection. 

  D. Eco-containers 

  The CMA CGM Group maintains a fleet of young and reliable containers by investing in innovative containers, thereby limiting its impact on the environment.

  These eco-containers include three main technologies: 

  • Bambou flooring : standard containers have wood flooring to receive goods. The wood used traditionally comes from an exotic tree that takes 60 years to mature and which is becoming increasingly rare nowadays. New wood species have been sought and bamboo was selected for its exceptional properties: bamboo grows back once it has been cut and only requires 4 to 5 years to reach maturity. At present, 14% of the container fleet used by the Group (owned and leased) is comprised of containers with bamboo flooring. • Low-consumption reefers: reefers are refrigerated containers that are specially designed for the transport of food and perishable goods requiring energy and refrigerating gases. Low-consumption reefers feature a more efficient motor serving to reduce its electricity costs and fuel consumption by a factor up to 3. At present, 65% of the reefer fleet used by the Group (owned and leased) is comprised of low-consumption reefers. • Light-steel containers: light-steel containers are as resistant as stand ard containers but are lighter and therefore help to optimise fuel consumption and limit greenhouse gases as well as air pollution. At present, 3% of the container fleet used by the Group (owned and leased) is comprised of light-steel containers.

  4. Customer solutions A. Carbon optimisation studies 

  Transporting goods on container ships creates a lower ton-kilometre carbon footprint than other methods of transport. To capitalise on this advantage, the environment department offers the Group’s lines technical support in order to add value to their offers of new maritime services. The goal is to quantify the excellence of the environmental performance with respect to other rival maritime or land solutions. For example, a study was conducted in order to promote the modal shift from road to “short sea” for a shipment of tomatoes in refrigerated containers between London and Morocco.

  asking for environmental information on the services they buy. Customer requests concerning the environment and the CSR relate to approximately 20% of the total volume carried. The growing significance of the carbon footprint criterion when selecting their transport provider explains the Group’s efforts to offer a broadening range of premium customers tailored services that are focused on their various impacts. This trend is manifested by the growing number of shippers joining the Clean Cargo Working Group. At the Autumn 2018 session, we noted the presence of major operators such as DECATHLON, LEVIS and PROCTER & GAMBLE as observers and who may integrate the working group in 2019. 

  As in previous years, the most frequent customer requests pertain to the carbon footprint of their shipments with CMA CGM. Historically, with a view to meeting this requirement, in 2011, the Group developed an eco-calculator that can estimate the carbon footprint for maritime transport between two ports. The eco-calculator is

  Since 2013, in compliance with French legislation, for every booking, the customers connected to the e-commerce platform have been given a calculation and automatic display of the carbon footprint of their shipment both at sea and inland. 

  For the third consecutive year, the Group 

  reports indicating the carbon footprint for all the bookings of an individual customer. In 2018, 85 customers of the Group selected based on the volume achieved as well as environmental involvement received an analysis of the breakdown of their total carbon emissions, by trade and by mode of transport. The goal in the upcoming years is to develop these reports in a more dynamic format.

  For the customers that are more advanced in their CSR approach, the Group offers the signature of a sustainability pact. This non-legally binding document is the concrete expression of a principle agreement on the implementation between two signatories of all methods likely to minimise their common impact on the environment, such as the identification of “green corridors”. Moreover, the partners undertake to actively pursue synergies and opportunities for practical positive action in the community, wherever they are established. 

  In September 2018, a new pact was signed with PANALPINA. This is the 3 rd agreement of this type signed between the Group and one of its customers, after Borouge and Schenker. 4 others are being prepared for 2019-2020. The Panalpina pact is centred on 4 main thrusts: the environment (both partners have official carbon reduction goals for 2025 and will systematically strive to pursue any joint opportunity for timely achievement of these goals), the social policy within both groups, observance of an officially documented Code of Ethics and serious examination of the company’s role within the broader community.

  94 commitment A. Dedicated training 

  CMA CGM invests in training courses designed to make environmental protection an integral part of all business activities. Upon hiring, all the Group’s new employees receive safety and environment training for their particular job so that they can do their work in full compliance with these rules. Depending on their job, every employee then has to attend specific training modules

  On 25/10 and 9/11 2018, two conferences were organised for the pricers of the lines, and the key accounts sales teams in charge of calls for tenders, in order to review the regulatory obligations concerning sulphur emissions for 2020 and the direct consequences on their jobs, especially as regards the inclusion of BAF (Bunker Adjustment Factor) clauses in sales contracts. 

  6. Awards and certifications

  for their field (for example: ISO 14001 for internal auditors, chemical risks for workers who handle chemicals, etc.). Moreover, for all seagoing employees of the Group, a training schedule is determined based on the rank and employee’s potential impact on the environment. This training course is conducted through e-learning and each employee may connect to the programme on board as well as on land. Special seminars for officers are also routinely organised at the Group’s head office to inform, raise their awareness and train officers on issues relating to health, safety, security and the environment. The seminars are held twice per year at the head office. An e-learning module that is accessible to all employees and which lists the key points of the Group’s environmental policy to be presented to customers, has been created on the Academy portal. This training module lasts 30 minutes and was taken by over 4,500 employees worldwide in 2018.

  B. Conferences and workshops CSR Days: Environmental conferences On 5 June 2018, during the sustainable development week held at the head office, a conference open to all employees laid down the Group’s CSR policy. This conference, which was followed by a question and answer session, was supplemented by two workshops intended more specifically for the Key Accounts sales teams. The aim was to inform these teams, who are in contact with the Group’s largest customers, of the environmental projects as well as the latest technological developments to be put forward. – cf page 21 CSR days: raising the awareness of employees to the Group CSR approach.

  The Group helps to further a large number of voluntary initiatives that contribute to preserving the environment and as such is recognised for its commitment each year by both customers and local authorities. 

  A. Voluntary environmental initiatives The CMA CGM Group is an active member of diverse environmental programmes focused on ocean preservation, the protection of fauna and air quality. Below are some of the highlights of 2018: • The CMA CGM Group was honoured by ISO 14001 in Spain, Green Flag in California, Clean Vessels Incentive in New 

  York and Blue Circle in Vancouver; • Environmental Ship Index - ESI. The Group has been taking part in this initiative for several years in 14 ports in Europe, the United States and in Asia. In 2018, two new agreements were signed with the Port of Marseilles/Fos and the Port of Pointe des galets in Reunion Island.

  ESI Focus – Environmental Shipping Index 

  WPCI – World Ports Climate Initiative is an initiative that was launched by the main ports worldwide, which have committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions via the ESI – Environmental Ship Index. The ESI is a platform that collects and rates the environmental information of ships regarding greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants. Based on the data that is updated quarterly, the ports “reward” the vessels with the highest performance. It should be noted that the ports of Longbeach (Green Flag Incentive Programme), New York (Clean Vessels Incentive Programme) and Vancouver (Blue Circle) rely on the ESI rating to reward the ships with the highest performance based on their own local programmes. 

  Between 1 May and 15 November 2018, CMA CGM took part in a voluntary campaign to reduce the speed of ships which was organised by the NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS). The goal was to reduce the speed of vessels to maximum 10 knots in the breeding sanctuaries of sea mammals on the West coast of the United States in order to avoid collisions.

  1. The CMA CGM Foundation Mrs Naïla Saadé started the CMA CGM Foundation in 2005 to sponsor advocacy projects for children. Since its inception, it has helped over 200 associations. Its mission is to foster personal development for disabled children, improve the daily life of children with illnesses and trauma victims and promote equal opprortunity for disadvantaged youths; through the the “Containers of Hope” campaign, it is helping humanitarian transport operations for the most vulnerable children all over the world. 

  A. Containers of Hope 

  In 2018, the Foundation resumed its humanitarian transport campaign, Containers of Hope, which provides NGOs with maritime transport for around one hundred containers per year on the CMA CGM Group’s ships to deliver aid to populations in conflict zones or areas exposed to health and humanitarian threats. The first campaign was launched in October 2012 with Action against Hunger and Doctors Without Borders and then

  expanded in 2014 to include the French Red Cross and other NGOs which so request. 

  Since the start of the campaign and the end of 2018, 700 containers carrying 5,000 tons of humanitarian supplies have been transported to partner NGO programmes in some thirty-five different countries, primarily in Africa. The supplies have helped to fight against infant malnutrition, improve access to water and satisfy the healthcare needs of the most vulnerable populations and mostly children.

  B. Call for projects 18 associations were supported in France and Lebanon in 2018 via a call for projects and the awarding of the Foundation Prize. In 2018, the Foundation continued to back projects helping at-risk children in France and Lebanon. As part of this effort, it launched its sixth themed call for projects focused on promoting the equal opportunity of children from disadvantaged

  Lebanon: 

  > Société Saint-Vincent-de-Paul: renovation and modernisation of the library to transform it into a

  D. Other local actions: 103 Support of 3 elementary schools in Marseilles The Foundation is committed to supporting local actions carried out in the areas surrounding the CMA CGM Tower. Indeed, one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Europe, the 3rd arrondissement in Marseilles, is located near to the head office. Three public elementary schools in this district applied to the Foundation for the organisation of nature trips (classes vertes) and ski trips for the various classes. Many pupils live below the poverty line and have never been outside of their disadvantaged neighbourhoods. These schools, through the OCCE13 association, will receive subsidies which will allow over 200 children to be able to experience a complete change of scenery and discover other horizons. 

  Set-up of the skills-based sponsorship program. In 2018, the CMA CGM Group also launched the skills-based sponsorship programme through its Foundation. Within this context, a test phase was initiated for a group of 10 CMA CGM employees, based in Marseilles. These employees got the opportunity, during their working time (paid for by the Group), to spend two half-days working alongside a partner

  C. Awarding of the Foundation Prize 

  The Foundation awarded its 2018 Prize to two associations working for disadvantaged children. 

  To mark the 10 th anniversary of its Prize, the CMA CGM Foundation decided to call on a prestigious patron: Martine Vassal, President of the Bouches-du-Rhône Local Council and President of the Aix- Marseilles-Provence Metropolitan Area. On 29 November 2018 at the CMA CGM Tower in Marseilles (France), Martine Vassal and Naïla Saadé, President of the CMA CGM Foundation, presented the 2018 Foundation Award to the heads of the Ecole des XV association. This Award recognises the work carried out by this association to fight against school drop- out and school failure amongst secondary

  school pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, by offering them an after- school programme associating homework assistance, tutoring and rugby sessions. 

  In Lebanon, the 2018 Foundation Award was presented to Arcenciel, on 26 December, during a ceremony held at CMA CGM head office in Beirut. Since 1985, Arcenciel has been contributing to the sustainable development of the Lebanese society by providing support to fragile populations and working towards the integration of marginalised people. 50,000 people have received assistance from this organisation and pioneer of social and solidarity-based economy in Lebanon. All their projects include the consideration of people with difficulties, the preservation of natural resources, business profitability and financial independence.

  association, from the month of September to late December 2018. – cf page 50 – Skills- based sponsorship program Many associations are in need of administrative, technical, organisational and support expertise. The volunteers provide their skills in these areas. In 2018, the skills sponsorship programme allowed employees from the Group to lend their expertise to four associations based in Marseilles: • Relais Enfants-Parents helps to foster relationships between incarcerated 

  parents and their children; • Ecole des XV fights against school drop- 

  out through rugby; • SOS Méditerranée organises rescue 

  operations in the Mediterranean sea; • Secours Populaire has been fighting against poverty since 1945.

  Partnership with the Télémaque Institute As part of the same effort to foster the engagement of employees, the CMA CGM Foundation set up a partnership with the Télémaque Institute in connection with its 2018 call for projects. This association works to promote equal opportunity in education from the secondary school level by assisting deserving and motivated youth from disadvantaged backgrounds via a dual “company-school” sponsorship (for each young person: a mentor at the company + a supervisor in his or her school). The goal of this support is to enable these young people to broaden their social and cultural horizons and learn about the working world and to encourage them to stay in school and develop self-confidence. 

  Through this partnership, the Foundation offered 5 Group employees the chance to mentor one young person during their free time for a renewable period of one year. Mentors help their mentees to develop their potential and to open up to the cultural and business world so that they can have all the opportunities that they deserve. This takes place along three lines: - By offering them cultural and sporting outings (museums, theatre, sports game, etc.) once per month; - By teaching mentees about their job, encouraging the mentees to think about their own career path and meet other professionals; - By encouraging mentees to believe in themselves and to aim for studies that are in line with their potential.

  Tragic incident at Rue d’Aubagne in Marseilles The Foundation also responds to emergency situations. The CMA CGM Group was very affected by the tragedy that occurred on 5 November at rue d’Aubagne in Marseilles and, via its Foundation, was keen to express its full- fledged solidarity to the victims and those most affected. This support was provided through: 

  • a donation of EUR 1,500 to Destination Familles , an association located in rue d’Aubagne which works for social cohesion in the Noailles district. This donation will be paid over in full to the family of a child 

  who lost a parent in the incident; • a donation of EUR 10,000 to Croix-Rouge française intended to assist the families 

  who have been relocated; • a donation of EUR 30,000 over three years to the Fondation Abbé Pierre Provence Alpes Côte d’Azur to work towards a sustained action against poor housing conditions. 

  International Day of Persons with Disabilities In 2018, the Foundation organised events for supported associations and CMA CGM employees. On October 9, 2018, on the International Day for Persons with Disabilities, the Foundation organised a Round-Table Discussion at the Head Office in Marseilles centered on disabilities. 20 Marseilles employees took part in this discussion and shared their views on improving the daily life of persons with disabilities, and their families, as well as the difficulties encountered for their inclusion into the workforce and how hard it is to assert yourself when you are disabled. 

  Forum of associations On November 29, on the same day as the Fondation France Prize giving ceremony, a first edition of the Forum of associations was held in the CMA CGM Tower. Of the 10 French associations whose applications won the 2018 call for projects, nine came to present their actions to the CMA CGM employees and offered volunteer missions. This forum was well received and was an opportunity for interaction and the sharing of views between the associations and employees.

  E. Cultural sponsorship 

  The Foundation remains loyal to sponsoring cultural events. In 2018, it once again supported educational activities at the Aix-en-Provence Festival. It sponsored Bach’s Mass in B minor by the “collegium musicale choir corelli baroque orchestra” and Gianluca Marciano, at the Festival Al Bustan; the concert given by Mathieu Chedid at the Baalbeck Festival and, as part of the Festival International de Piano de La Roque d’Anthéron, it sponsored the piano recital given by Nelson Freire and Sinfonia Varsovia (Mozart) in the Parc du Château de Florans. 50 tickets for this recital were offered to CMA CGM employees. 

  2. Actions carried out within local communities For CMA CGM, local action involves a voluntary, one-off or recurrent initiative, carried out by a CMA CGM entity, involving CMA CGM employees, that has an environmental, social or societal theme and which directly impacts the local communities in which the Group or its subsidiaries carry out their operations. This year, the Group was involved in over 38 local community actions across 20 countries, i.e. 90% more local actions reported compared with 2017. The following map shows a few of the 2018 initiatives, with the countries where the Group carried out the action shown in blue:

  


**************************** Page 54****************************

  Below are a few examples of initiatives carried out in 2018: 

  • In August 2018, the Kerala region in India was severely affected by flooding. The CMA CGM Group carried a container filled with basic necessities such as food and medication to assist the victims. 

  • In October 2018, after a tsunami hit Indonesia, CMA CGM Indonesia rallied to help the victims: the employees on site

  3. Emergency assistance – natural disasters In times of crisis, the CMA CGM Group works in conjunc- tion with governments and humanitarian organisations worldwide to provide aid to affected populations and meet their immediate basic needs. The CMA CGM teams strive to make a difference in the lives of extre - mely vulnerable populations and demonstrate their wil - lingness to assist those most in need by providing logis - tics expertise for the transport of aid and by collecting donations in kind such as water, food and clothing. 

  raised 15 million Indonesian Ruppies to buy products such as food, water and hygiene products. These goods were transported by CMA CGM to be distributed to the affected areas. 

  • In Saipan, devastated by the super typhoon Yutu in October 2018, the Group transported a cargo of emergency aid which was received by the Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

  Humanitarian Services Office 

  In late 2017, CMA CGM decided to create the Humanitarian Services Office to offer international organisations and NGOs a single point of contact. This office allows the Group to offer “tailored” solutions to these emergency organisations, such as: 

  • Giving them direct access to CMA CGM’s 

  services and global network of agencies; • Centralising and rationalising their specific 

  transport needs and requirements; • Providing them with professional advice by leveraging on the Group’s experience and expertise in handling logistics issues;

  • Offering them guidance in the shipment of humanitarian aid supplies, via appropriate transport methods, reliable end-to-end solutions and procedures at competitive 

  prices; • Helping them to maximise the effect of the aid they provide and take part in their mission to overcome humanitarian crises. 

  Since the Humanitarian Services Office was launched, NGOs and international organisations have praised the initiative and have worked with the office on a daily basis to devise appropriate solutions. In 2018, the office enabled the humanitarian transport of 10,665 twenty-foot equivalent (TEU) containers.

  Methodological note

  Social indicators were defined in 2013 and updated in 2018. Established based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) criteria and designed to meet French legal requirements (NRE Act of 15 May 2001 and Article 225 of the enforcing decree dated 24 April 2012), while including current international maximum standards. 

  Scope: The reporting of the CMA CGM Group’s non-financial data pertains to a consolidated scope (excluding French and international seagoing personnel). The Total Workforce and breakdown of workforce per region indicators apply to the consolidated entities in the global scope as of 31 December of the reference year. Gender, Age, Hiring & Departure indicators are made available for a limited portion of the consolidated scope because some subsidiaries have not been reported. • Gender and geographical area - Information available for 81% of the Group consolidated 

  workforce • Age - Information available for 77% of the Group consolidated workforce

  C&Me reporting tools (excluding seag-oing personnel and international employees scope): The indicators are collected and consolidated by the HR C&Me information system. C&Me relates to 81% of the Group consolidated workforce. Excel spreadsheets supplement the reporting for the office- based employees – relate to 6% of the Group workforce. 

  Workforce: Note 1 : The workforce broken down per individual relates to the Group consolidated world scope as of 31 December of the reference year. They include employees with an employment contract at one of the CMA CGM Group‘s companies as of 31 December of the reference year. The following are included: indefinite-term work contracts, fixed-term work contracts, expatriates (by site of secondment), employees on maternity or paternity leave, interns and VIE participants (excluding France). Note 2 : The workforce broken down by gender includes the percentage of male employees and the percentage of female employees. The distribution by age is

  • Hiring & Departures - Information available for 81% of the Group consolidated 

  workforce • The number of training hours scope: the scope of the classroom-based training data corresponds to France office-based employees and seagoing personnel, i.e. 23.6% of the Group consolidated workforce for 2018 // The scope of the e-learning data corresponds to office- based employees and Global Crewing in C&Me, i.e. 94% of the Group consolidated 2018 workforce. It is worth noting that the reporting process of the “training” data is being rendered more reliable, and eventually the goal is to achieve a scope of the Group’s entire consolidated workforce. Furthermore, all of the data associated with the training of employees from all of the Group’s entities will eventually be gathered via the C&Me tool. Finally, as the reporting methodology has changed in relation to calculation of e-learning hours, the 2017 data was not reused; as it cannot be compared with the 2018 values. 

  Period: The reporting period is from 01/01/2017 to 31/12/2017 and from 01/01/2018 to 31/12/2018.

  broken down as follows: younger than 20 years old, 20 to 29 years old, 30 to 39 years old, 40 to 49 years old, 50 to 59 years old, 60 years and older. These categories were established based on available data. Some branches and subsidiaries do not report due to specific local regulatory constraints (or inclusion in scope). Note 3 : The breakdown of workforce by geographic area pertains to the following categories: France, Europe (excluding France), Africa – Middle-East, the Americas, Asia – Oceania. 

  Hirings and dismissals: Note 1 : Hiring pertains to the number of employees who joined the company between 01 January and 31 December of the reference year, depending on the contracts as defined in Note 1 / Workforce. Someone is also considered a new hire in their company when they are reassigned and signed a new employment contract with a different company within the Group or have an amendment to the original contract that results in a permanent assignment to a different Group company.

  Note 2 : Dismissals relate to the number of employees leaving the workforce due to the company’s decision between 01 January and 31 December of the reference year, employees under contract. This includes redundancies, dismissals for actual and serious cause, dismissals for gross misconduct, dismissals for unfitness (further to a work accident, occupational disease) or for non-professional reasons. The dismissal rate is calculated based on the number of dismissed persons / total workforce. 

  Training Note 1 : All types of training courses are included (internal and external) and all training methods (classroom, e-learning) are counted, as long as the training action

  Training of French and international Crewing: The number of training hours for the French and international seagoing personnel corresponds to the sum of the number of e-learning training hours, added to the number of classroom-based training hours: • The number of classroom-based training hours is obtained by applying an average duration of 7 hours of training per day of 

  training administered • The number of e-learning training hours is obtained via the online training software 

  Note: the change in the number of training courses between 2017 and 2018 is primarily associated with the change in the calculation method.

  Frequency rate of maritime work accidents: LThe frequency rate for work accidents is calculated for the maritime scope (fleet owned by CMA Ships) based on the number of accidents with sick leave and the total number of hours worked. 

  It includes accidents among the seagoing staff employed by the Group, as well as the seagoing staff employed by Manning agencies. An accident with leave is considered to be any accident that results in leave from work onboard ship. Accidents that result in work leave only after disembarkment are not taken into account.

  Regarding French Crewing: The payroll tool specific to French Crewing is used to obtain all the information concerning the HR data of the French seafarers. 

  Regarding International Crewing: The workforce counted in the International Crewing HR indicators correspond to seafarers with a permanent employment contract or a contract with CMA CGM or all its subsidiaries: these seafarers work on the vessels of the CMA CGM Group fleet, the vessels of other shipowners, which carry out one-off jobs at the other entities of the Group. If the shore-based assignment is definitive (via a change of contract), the employee is therefore counted in the shore- based workforce.

  Definition of Scope 3: Scope 3 emissions are emissions resulting from the building of vessels and containers, vessels solid and liquid waste production, employees business trips, fuel oil consumption specific to the pre- and post-shipment services and upstream emissions stemming from the actual production and transport of fuel burnt on our vessels. 

  • Ship building: For each vessel built in the year, we consider the weight of the vessel (no ballast, fuel, oil, cargo) in tons and we apply an emission factor of 1.75 (1.75 tons of CO 2 emitted to produce 1 ton of steel); 

  • Container building: For all the containers built during the year on behalf of CMA CGM, we consider the empty weight (tare weight of a twenty-foot container = 2.2 tons) and we apply an emission factor of 1.75 (1.75 tons of CO 2 emitted to produce 1 ton

NOx = total fuel consumption by type * NOx emission factor by type of fuel The following emission factors are applied to the fuel consumption for the maritime activity: • HSFO / LSFO: 86 kg of NOx / tons of fuel oil • DO: 56 kg of NOx / tons of fuel oil (Source: 3rd IMO GHG study 2014) 

  Accidental releases: Accidental releases relate to unintentional releases of hazardous or non-hazardous liquid discharges from the owned vesselsl, whether or not the CMA CGM Group is liable. The reporting scope pertains to the owned fleet of the Group and is based on the feedback from the Report of Notification (RON) sent in by the vessels. 

  Solid waste: The volume of solid waste (hazardous and non-hazardous) is reported by the ships based on waste reduction programme called “Green Ship”. Each vessel sends a summary by category of solid waste generated on board on the basis of the crew’s visual estimation. They are expressed in m3 or in pieces, depending on the category. These reports are then compiled and the figures are analysed to determine the total volume of waste generated by the owned fleet. Sludge is not taken into account in this indicator.

  The identification of the major CSR challenges for the Group was developed in partnership with various Group departments: Environment, Security, Safety, Human Resources, Ethics & Compliance, Purchasing Risk. An initial list of material CSR challenges for the maritime transport sector was drawn up using a documentary and regulatory analysis. The following challenges were identified: • Business ethics: Economic sanctions and embargoes, free competition, corruption, conflict of interests, fraud, data confidentiality and protection • Value chain: Customer Centricity, Innovation and sustainable added value, Long-term 

  partnerships with our suppliers • Social: Diversity – Mixity & inclusion, Employee working conditions, employee 

  development • Safety and security: maritime safety, occupational safety (H&S), goods safety, 

  safety of assets, international security • Environment: Energy, Resources, Materials & Waste, Pollution and releases, Oceans:
